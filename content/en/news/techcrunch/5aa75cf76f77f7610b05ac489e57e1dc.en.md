Google keeps releasing experimental products built with its AI models to give users a taste of its capabilities. Last year, [the company debuted an image remixing tool](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/google-experiments-with-a-new-image-generator-that-remixes-three-images-into-one-creation/) called [Whisk](https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk) that was available to users in the U.S. On Tuesday, Google made the tool available in more than 100 countries.

There are plenty of image-generation tools that create images through text prompts. Google Whisk tries to make things easier by letting you upload three images for subject, scene and style, and remix them into a new creation powered by the Imagen 3 model.

If you want to customize the image, you can use text prompts for the overall image or specific to the subject, scene or style.

[Appleâ€™s Image Playground](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/how-to-use-apple-intelligence-image-playground-feature/) also lets you create images in a similar manner by combining styles and subjects.

Notably, Whisk is not available in countries and regions like India, Indonesia, the EU, and the U.K.
