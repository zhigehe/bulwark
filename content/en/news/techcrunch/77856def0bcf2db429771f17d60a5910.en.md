OpenAI is expanding its footprint to Germany. [According to a press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/germany-trade--invest-openai-expands-to-germany-302371354.html) issued Friday, the ChatGPT maker plans to open an office in Munich in the coming months.

“Germany is renowned for its technical expertise, academic excellence, and industrial innovation,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a statement. “Opening our first office in Germany means we can help even more people, businesses, and institutions benefit from AI’s possibilities.”

Per the press release, OpenAI has been discussing opening a German satellite office with German officials since 2023. In Europe, Germany has the greatest number of users, paying subscribers, and API developers building on OpenAI’s technology, according to the startup.

It’s unclear how many people OpenAI might hire for its German office — and what their roles will be. We’ve contacted OpenAI for comment and will update this post if we hear back.

OpenAI’s new home in Southern Germany comes after the San Francisco-based firm opened offices in Paris, Brussels, and Dublin, growing its EU presence.
