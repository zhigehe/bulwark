[Stripe](https://techcrunch.com/tag/stripe/) is in talks for another shareholder sale that could value the company at “at least” $85 billion, according to multiple reports and a source familiar with the matter.

The Information first [reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-considers-employee-share-sale-at-85-billion-valuation-or-more) the news that the payments infrastructure giant is working to sell employee-owned stocks. The move would help workers gain some liquidity as Stripe continues to hold off on long-awaited plans to go public.

Stripe last February conducted a similar tender offer in which it was [valued at $70 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/major-stripe-investor-sequoia-confirms-70b-valuation-offers-its-investors-a-payday/). The company spiked to [a $95 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/) in 2021, making it one of the – if not the – most highly valued private companies in the world.

In January, Stripe said it was [laying off 300 workers](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/stripe-is-laying-off-300-people-but-says-it-still-plans-to-hire-in-2025/), but still had plans to grow its headcount to about 10,000 by year’s end.
