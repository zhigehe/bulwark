Fei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer scientist and [startup founder](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/) sometimes known as “the Godmother of AI,” has outlined “[three fundamental principles for the future of AI policymaking](https://www.ft.com/content/3861a30a-50fc-41c9-9780-b16626a0d2e8)” ahead of next week’s AI Action Summit in Paris.

First, Li said policy must be based on “science, not science fiction.” In other words, policymakers should focus on the current reality of AI, not on grandiose futuristic scenarios, “whether utopia or apocalypse.”

In particular, Li said that it’s critical for policymakers to understand that chatbots and co-pilot programs “are not forms of intelligence with intentions, free will or consciousness,” so they can avoid “the distraction of far-fetched scenarios” and focus instead on “vital challenges.”

Second, she argued that policy should “be pragmatic, rather than ideological,” by which she means it should be written to “minimise unintended consequences while incentivising innovation.”

Lastly, Li said these policy must empower “the entire AI ecosystem — including open-source communities and academia.”

“Open access to AI models and computational tools is crucial for progress,” she said. “Limiting it will create barriers and slow innovation, particularly for academic institutions and researchers who have fewer resources than their private-sector counterparts.”
