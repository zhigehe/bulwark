Hotstar and JioCinema, two widely used video streaming apps in India, have merged into JioHotstar.

JioStar, a joint venture between Reliance-owned Viacom18 and Star India, said Friday it had integrated JioCinema’s content into a revamped version of Disney’s Hotstar platform.

The merged service will feature movies and TV shows from Disney, Warner Bros, NBCUniversal and Paramount, and aims to reach more than 500 million users in the country.

The consolidation follows Reliance’s $8.5 billion merger with Walt Disney’s Indian assets last year, which created a joint venture that controls about 85% of India’s streaming market and half of television viewership.

“Entertainment is no longer a privilege, but a shared experience for all,” said Kiran Mani, JioStar’s digital chief executive. The group said existing JioCinema subscribers would transition to JioHotstar once their current subscriptions expire.

The merger brings India’s most valuable sports rights under one platform, including cricket properties such as the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council tournaments, alongside the soccer Premier League and FIFA World Cup.

JioCinema’s app will be phased out after existing customers’ subscriptions expire. JioCinema subscribers will be able to “seamlessly” transition and set up their JioHotstar subscriptions, the company said.

The consolidation reflects the difficulties foreign media groups have faced in India’s price-sensitive market. Netflix and Amazon Prime have also struggled to grow paid subscriptions despite heavy investment in local content.

JioHotstar will offer content in 19 languages and produce 30,000 hours of television programming annually. Basic subscription plans start at ₹149 ($1.71).

The venture brings together more than 100 television channels and nearly 300,000 hours of entertainment content.
