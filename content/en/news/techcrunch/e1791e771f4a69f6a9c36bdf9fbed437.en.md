ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch [in November 2022.](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/31/chatgpt-everything-released-from-the-ai-powered-chatbot-in-2022/) What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with [short text prompts](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/chatgpt-prompts-how-to-optimize-for-sales-marketing-writing-and-more/) has evolved into a behemoth with [300 million weekly active users.](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-surpasses-300-million-weekly-active-users)

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its [partnership with Apple](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-chatgpt-to-its-apps-including-siri/) for its generative AI offering, [Apple Intelligence,](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-is-the-companys-new-generative-ai-offering/) the release of [GPT-4o with voice capabilities,](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/chatgpt-now-understands-real-time-video-seven-months-after-openai-first-demoed-it/) and the highly-anticipated launch of its [text-to-video model Sora.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-video-generator-might-not-be-available-in-the-eu-at-launch/)

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and [longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tc&utm_campaign=tc_week_in_review) and [CTO Mira Murati.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-shes-leaving-the-company/) OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from [Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/30/microsoft-openai-lawsuit-copyright-newspapers-alden-global) alleging copyright infringement, as well as [an injunction from Elon Musk](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/30/elon-musk-files-for-injunction-to-halt-openais-transition-to-a-for-profit/) to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to [Chinese rivals like DeepSeek](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/). The company has been trying to shore up its [relationship with Washington](https://siliconangle.com/2025/01/19/openai-ceo-brief-us-officials-advanced-ai-agents-capable-complex-tasks/) as it simultaneously [pursues an ambitious data center project,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/) and as it [reportedly lays the groundwork](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-40b-at-a-340b-valuation/) for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out [our ChatGPT FAQ here.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/#faq)

### February 2025

#### OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

#### ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A [commonly cited stat](https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/chatgpt-uses-10-times-more-power-than-google-searches-says-goldman-sachs-19435551.htm) is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit [AI research institute Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use) found the average ChatGPT query [consumes around 0.3 watt-hours.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed/) However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

#### OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates [its step-by-step “thought” process.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-models-thought-process/) ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

#### You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search [without having to log in.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in/) While OpenAI [had previously allowed](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/chatgpt-no-longer-requires-an-account-but-theres-a-catch/) users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

#### OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” [called deep research](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research/) that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

### **January 2025**

#### OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to [measure the persuasive abilities](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-used-this-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion/) of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user [posts from the subreddit](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/openai-inks-deal-to-train-ai-on-reddit-data/) and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

#### OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model

OpenAI launched a new [AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model/) the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first [previewed the model in December](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/openai-announces-new-o3-model/) alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

#### ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that [over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/chatgpts-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says/) are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

#### OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov [designed to provide U.S. government agencies](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/) an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

#### More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, [according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-techs-faults/) In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

#### OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, [the company’s AI “agent” tool,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/) for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, [which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days/)

#### OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can [take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/) Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

#### OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, [OpenAI’s agent tool,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/openais-agent-tool-may-be-nearing-release/) could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that [Operator will be available as an early research preview](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openais-agent-tool-will-be-available-to-users-paying-200-per-month-for-pro/) to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but [a user on X who goes by Choi](https://x.com/arrakis_ai/status/1882343287522226591) spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

#### OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users [sign up with only a phone number](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/openai-tests-letting-users-sign-up-for-chatgpt-with-only-a-phone-number/) — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

#### ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, [allows users to set simple reminders](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks/). For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

#### New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to [customize their interactions with ChatGPT.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/chatgpts-newest-feature-lets-user-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z/) Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, [some users reported](https://x.com/Makuh90/status/1877479064967295484) that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

### December 2024

#### ChatGPT Search can be tricked into misleading users, new research reveals

ChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries, [The Guardian has found.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/24/chatgpt-search-tool-vulnerable-to-manipulation-and-deception-tests-show) They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews and [generate “entirely positive” summaries](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/chatgpt-search-can-be-tricked-into-misleading-users-new-research-reveals/) by inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method.

#### Microsoft and OpenAI reportedly have a finance-centric definition of AGI

Microsoft and OpenAI have a very [specific, internal definition of AGI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/microsoft-and-openai-have-a-financial-definition-of-agi-report/) based on the startup’s profits, according to a new [report from The Information.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-wrangle-over-terms-of-their-blockbuster-partnership?rc=dp0mql) The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect.

#### OpenAI trained o1 and o3 to ‘think’ about its safety policy

OpenAI [released new research](https://assets.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/4pNYAZteAQXWtloDdANQ7L/978a6fd0a2ee268b2cb59637bd074cca/OpenAI_Deliberative-Alignment-Reasoning-Enables-Safer_Language-Models_122024.pdf) outlining the company’s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used “deliberative alignment” to make o1 and o3 [“think” about OpenAI’s safety policy.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/openai-trained-o1-and-o3-to-think-about-its-safety-policy/) According to OpenAI’s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered “unsafe” questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones.

#### OpenAI announces new o3 reasoning models

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced [the successors to its o1 reasoning model family:](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/openai-announces-new-o3-model/) o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the “12 Days of OpenAI” event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT.

#### OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline

In an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announced [a 1-800 number to call the chatbot](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/openai-brings-chatgpt-to-your-landline/) — even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode — minus the multimodality.

OpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply.

#### OpenAI brings its ChatGPT Search to more users

OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Search [to free, logged in users.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/openai-brings-its-ai-powered-web-search-tool-to-more-chatgpt-users/) Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid users [when it launched in October.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/) Not only is Search available now for free users, but it’s also been integrated [into Advanced Voice Mode.](https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2930515/advanced-voice-mode-is-finally-getting-vision-capabilities/)

#### OpenAI blames massive ChatGPT outage on a ‘new telemetry service’

OpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a “new telemetry service” gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn’t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a [telemetry service it deployed](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/openai-blames-its-massive-chatgpt-outage-on-a-new-telemetry-service/) to collect Kubernetes metrics.

#### You can make ChatGPT sound like Santa for a limited time

OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could access [a new “Santa Mode” voice](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/you-can-make-chatgpt-sound-like-santa-claus-for-the-holidays/) during December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, “merry and bright,” as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly — more or less like every Santa you’ve ever heard.

#### OpenAI adds vision to Advanced Voice Mode

OpenAI released the [real-time video capabilities for ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/chatgpt-now-understands-real-time-video-seven-months-after-openai-first-demoed-it/) that it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what’s on a device’s screen through screen sharing.

There’s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to [our live blog](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/openais-2024-event-live-updates-for-chatgpt-product-reveals-and-demos/) to stay updated.

#### ChatGPT and Sora hit with a major outage

ChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbus [denied it in a post on X](https://x.com/edwinarbus/status/1867091090475716847), saying the “outage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.”

#### Canvas rolls out to everyone

Canvas, OpenAI’s [collaboration-focused interface](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/openai-launches-new-canvas-chatgpt-interface-tailored-to-writing-and-coding-projects/) for writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs.

#### OpenAI pauses Sora sign-ups due to high demand

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. The [company released Sora](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-video-generator-might-not-be-available-in-the-eu-at-launch/) as part of its “12 Days of OpenAI” event following [nearly a year of teasing the product.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/openais-newest-model-can-generate-videos-and-they-look-decent/)

#### OpenAI releases Sora for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers

OpenAI has finally released its [text to video model, Sora.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-video-generator-might-not-be-available-in-the-eu-at-launch/) The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be “remixed” through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today to [ChatGPT Pro](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openai-confirms-its-new-200-plan-chatgpt-pro-which-includes-reasoning-models-and-more/) and Plus subscribers (except in the EU).

In Monday’s [“12 Days of OpenAI” livestream,](https://www.youtube.com/live/2jKVx2vyZOY?si=NZGKYR6izM11J8Ey) CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get “unlimited” generations in their “slow queue mode” and 500 “normal” generations per month.

There are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to [our live blog](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/openais-2024-event-live-updates-for-chatgpt-product-reveals-and-demos/) to stay updated.

#### OpenAI launches $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro subscription — and full version of o1

On day one of its [12 Days of OpenAI event,](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/openais-2024-event-live-updates-for-chatgpt-product-reveals-and-demos/) the company announced a new — and expensive — subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a [$200-per-month tier](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openai-confirms-its-new-200-plan-chatgpt-pro-which-includes-reasoning-models-and-more/) that provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI’s models, including the full version of its o1 “reasoning” model.

The full version of o1, which was [released as a preview in September,](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/openai-unveils-a-model-that-can-fact-check-itself/) can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be “more concise in its thinking” to improve response times.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happens [on our live blog.](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/openais-2024-event-live-updates-for-chatgpt-product-reveals-and-demos/) Follow along with us!

#### OpenAI announces 12 days of reveals for the holidays

OpenAI announced [“12 Days of OpenAI,”](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1864328928267259941) which will feature livestreams every weekday starting December 5 at 10 a.m. PT. Each day’s stream is said to include either a product launch or a demo in varying sizes.

#### ChatGPT surpasses 300M weekly active users, Sam Altman says

At the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT has [surpassed 300 million weekly active users.](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-surpasses-300-million-weekly-active-users) The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbot [hit 200 million weekly active users](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-chatgpts-weekly-users-have-grown-200-million-2024-08-29/) in August 2024 and just over a year after [reaching 100 million weekly active users](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/openais-chatgpt-now-has-100-million-weekly-active-users/) in November 2023.

### November 2024

#### Users discovered the name ‘David Mayer’ crashed ChatGPT

ChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questions [asked about a “David Mayer,”](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/why-does-the-name-david-mayer-crash-chatgpt-digital-privacy-requests-may-be-at-fault/) and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it: [digital privacy requests.](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/when-forgetting-isnt-best-zittrain-discusses-the-right-to-be-forgotten/)

#### Ads might be headed to ChatGPT

OpenAI is toying with [the idea of getting into ads.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/ads-might-be-coming-to-chatgpt-despite-sam-altman-not-being-a-fan/) CFO Sarah Friar [told the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/9350d075-1658-4d3c-8bc9-b9b3dfc29b26) it’s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be “thoughtful” about when and where ads appear — though she later stressed that the company has “no active plans to pursue advertising.” Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently said [ads would be a “last resort.”](https://youtu.be/FVRHTWWEIz4?feature=shared&t=2263)

#### Canadian news companies sue OpenAI

A group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, [have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/study-of-chatgpt-citations-makes-dismal-reading-for-publishers/) The companies behind the suit said that OpenAI infringed their copyrights and are seeking to win monetary damages — and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work.

#### GPT-4o gets an upgrade

#### ChatGPT no longer requires an account — but there’s a catch

You can now use ChatGPT [without signing up for an account](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/chatgpt-no-longer-requires-an-account-but-theres-a-catch/), but it won’t be quite the same experience. You won’t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have “slightly more restrictive content policies,” according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:

“The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,” a spokesperson said.

### March 2024

#### OpenAI’s chatbot store is filling up with spam

TechCrunch found that the OpenAI’s GPT Store [is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/openais-chatbot-store-is-filling-up-with-spam/).

#### OpenAI VP doesn’t say whether artists should be paid for training data

At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether [artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/should-artists-be-paid-for-training-data-openai-vp-wouldnt-say/). While OpenAI lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.

#### A new report estimates that ChatGPT uses more than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day

ChatGPT’s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a [report from The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-obscene-energy-demands-of-ai), ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.

#### Developing AI models would be “impossible” without copyrighted materials, OpenAI claims

Following a proposed [ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/07/openai-warns-copyright-crackdown-could-doom-chatgpt/) in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.”

#### OpenAI claims The New York Times’ copyright lawsuit is without merit

[OpenAI published a public response](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/openai-claims-ny-times-copyright-lawsuit-is-without-merit/) to The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.

[In the response](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1744419710635229424?s=20), OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.”

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

#### What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

#### Can ChatGPT write essays?

Yes.

#### Can ChatGPT commit libel?

[Due to the nature of how these models work](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/), they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how [handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/) will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

### What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

### How good is ChatGPT at writing code?

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.

### Can you save a ChatGPT chat?

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

### Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?

Yes. There are [multiple AI-powered chatbot](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/) competitors such as [Together](https://www.together.xyz/), Google’s [Gemini](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/) and Anthropic’s [Claude](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/), and developers are [creating open source](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/) [alternatives](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/).

### How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30). This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “[OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request](https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30)”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance) for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

### What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where [two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/) (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced [he may sue OpenAI for defamation](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content) due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after [Futurism reported](https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai) the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was [accused](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing) of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, [including New York City Public Schools](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/), have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that [not every educator agrees with](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html).

### Are ChatGPT chats public?

No. But OpenAI [recently](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage) disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

### What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is [involved](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit) in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.
