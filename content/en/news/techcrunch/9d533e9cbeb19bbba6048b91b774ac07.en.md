People magazine has landed [the first interview](https://people.com/elizabeth-holmes-breaks-her-silence-in-first-interview-from-prison-it-s-been-hell-and-torture-exclusive-8789737) with Elizabeth Holmes since she reported to prison in 2023, and the convicted Theranos founder says she is still working on “research and inventions” in the healthcare space.

“I remain completely committed to my dream of making affordable healthcare solutions available to everyone,” she told the magazine.

Holmes, who pled not guilty at her trial in 2021, told People’s Danielle Bacher that she “refused to plead guilty to crimes I did not commit. Theranos failed. But failure is not fraud.”

The interview also covers her life in the federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, where she’s serving an 11.25-year sentence that has been reduced to nine years for good behavior. Holmes was found guilty on [four counts of fraud in 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/). Her former Theranos partner Sunny Balwani was [found guilty](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/theranos-exec-sunny-balwani-sentenced-to-13-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-patients-and-investors/) on 12 charges that same year and was given a 13-year sentence.
