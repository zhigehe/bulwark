Plaid, a company that connects bank accounts to financial applications, is working on a deal to allow early-stage investors and employees to sell their stock to Goldman Sachs, which will pay between [$300 million and $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/fintech-startup-plaid-said-to-tap-goldman-sachs-for-share-sale?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy&embedded-checkout=true) for existing shares, Bloomberg reported citing sources.

The tender offer, as such deals are called, will likely value the company lower than its previous financing round.  Plaid raised a $425 million Series D at a post-money valuation of [$13.4 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/) in April 2021 in a deal led by Altimeter Capital.

But since then, higher interest rates have led to [lower valuations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/fintech-rapyd-seeks-funding-at-3-5b-valuation-a-steep-drop-from-9b/) for many fintech startups.

Plaid didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

While Plaid initially focused on fintech clients, its customer base now includes established financial companies like H&R Block, Western Union, and Citi. The company’s revenue increased more than 25% in 2024, Bloomberg reported [last month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/fintech-startup-plaid-said-to-tap-goldman-sachs-for-share-sale?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy&embedded-checkout=true).
