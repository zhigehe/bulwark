In the wake of Meta’s decision to remove its [third-party fact-checking system](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/) and loosen content moderation policies, Google searches on how to delete Facebook, Instagram, and Threads [have been on the rise](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/google-searches-for-deleting-facebook-instagram-explode-after-meta-ends-fact-checking/).

People who are angry with the decision accuse Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of cozying up to the Trump administration at the expense of turning the company’s social media platforms into more of a hotbed for misinformation and polarizing speech than they already are. Zuckerberg’s remarks that the company’s third-party fact checkers were “too politically biased” for his vision of “free expression” probably didn’t help matters.

Since Meta’s announcement, many users have called out inconsistencies with Zuckerberg’s newfound commitment to free speech. Meta admitted in mid-January that it [blocked links to Pixelfed](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-admits-it-deleted-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed-194624098.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABzgTUJBt3MEs0ckdsREiYXNhdjpwedG_TnTBBhsmUw7Bot-Yp0ASgDaJ5jyJWFLY2gkLzXNzyQhR9Yu5b6heMYdRG8emq5ntM9FtwQdxfO3bxkwSzcniUVqTzo9--UKJx8BXreGVpZNMeuXuDxeSIGKkX41bvuGZRT1VGM7kOyy), an Instagram competitor. And just days after Zuckerberg took a front row seat in President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, [Instagram blocked searches](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/instagram-blocked-searches-for-democrats-and-other-political-hashtags-195612128.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEWGvnPGWK4ZQ1fQugcR2KIfoBN9CBFIuSZCKF0wYp7Oi93qB28O5w4O4t8mn1nacJMG85wihQoQfAICC826cW2sjh1MjSxgEo6aQUTyy9fPNKWMWQU-Zkk0IyIPAI9lmBwr8-ilYuJE824oHbJcOdhmOsphaOM-pAynzF0tRDXU) related to a number of political hashtags, including #democrats and #jan6th.

People outside the U.S. might be considering their options, too. Meta says it will [keep fact-checkers](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/meta-confirms-it-will-keep-fact-checkers-outside-the-u-s-for-now/) in markets outside the U.S. “for now,” but things could change.

Zuckerberg has said he wants to return to “[OG Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/mark-zuckerberg-teases-a-2025-return-to-og-facebook/)” and is planning to refresh the Facebook product this year to lure in Gen Z. Whether Meta will succeed remains uncertain, particularly as TikTok’s potential ban has led young users not into Meta’s arms, but towards other Chinese apps like RedNote. My guess is, many won’t stick around to find out what Zuckerberg’s idea of being “culturally influential” is.

So if you, like countless others, have had it with Meta’s algorithms whipping you into a frenzy over [insert cultural or political issue here] and are tired of the company slurping up your data to train its AI or send you targeted advertising and [political messaging](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/), then read on.

**How to download your Facebook archive**
-----------------------------------------

If you’re really set on deleting (and not just deactivating) your Facebook account, you should download your personal information from the Facebook archives, which includes photos, active sessions, chat history, IP addresses, facial recognition data, and ads you clicked on.

Note that these instructions require a computer and a web browser, not a mobile phone.

Here’s what to do:

* Click the down arrow under your profile picture in the upper-right corner.
* Go to **Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**.
* Scroll down on the left-hand column till you get to **Your information**, and click **Download your information.**
* You will be prompted to visit the **Accounts Center**. Click **Continue**.
* When the pop-up appears, click **Download or transfer information**.
* You can choose information from which accounts, including your Facebook, Instagram, and Meta Horizon accounts, to download. Click **Next**.
* Choose how much information you want to download, and click **Next**. Note from FB: “If you select Specific types of information, you will be able to choose which kinds of information you want to download, including data logs.”
* Decide if you want to download your info to a device or directly transfer your info to a destination and click **Next**.
  + If you select **Transfer to destination**, you can choose the destination and schedule future transfers. Once you make your selection, click **Start transfer** and enter your Facebook profile password.
  + If you select **Download to device**, choose your file options. There will be a list that lets you create a date range, and you can download in HTML or JSON, and choose between high, medium, or low media quality.
* Click **Submit request**.

**How to delete your Facebook account**
---------------------------------------

Note: If you do delete your account, you cannot regain access to it. Facebook delays deletion for a few days after it’s requested and will cancel your deletion request if you log back into Facebook during this time.

Also worth noting, some information like messaging history isn’t stored in your account, so your friends might still have access to messages you sent after your account is deleted.

With that in mind, here’s how to do it:

* Click your profile picture in the top right corner.
* Go to **Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**.
* Click **Accounts Center** at the top left of the screen.
* Click **Personal details**, under Account Settings.
* Click **Account ownership and control**.
* Click **Deactivation or deletion**.
* Choose the account or profile you want to deactivate.
* Select **Delete account**.
* Click **Continue** and follow instructions to confirm.

**How to download your Instagram information**
----------------------------------------------

There are two ways to find the web page where you’ll download your Instagram information — you go through the [Accounts Center](https://accountscenter.instagram.com/info_and_permissions/) or your Instagram Settings. For the former, navigate to **Your information and permissions** to find **Download your information**. To get to Instagram Settings, click on the three parallel lines on the bottom left of your screen, then click **Your activity**…

Either of those steps will take you to the **Download your information** page. You’ll need to click the profiles you want to download your information from and choose if you want to download it to a device or directly transfer the information to another destination.

If you select **Download to device**, you’ll have to pick a date range, notification email, format of your download request, and quality of photos, videos, and other media — the same as with downloading your Facebook info. Then click **Create files**.

Once you’ve made the request, it’ll appear as **In progress** under the Current Activity tab in the **Download your information** tool. Instagram will notify you by email and on the app when it’s ready to go, and you’ll have four days to download the information.

**How to delete your Instagram account**
----------------------------------------

Downloaded your info? Now you’re ready to permanently delete.

Here’s how to do it on the web page:

* Go directly to [**Accounts ownership and control settings**](https://accountscenter.instagram.com/personal_info/account_ownership_and_control) in the Accounts Center.
* Click **Deactivation or deletion**.
* Click the account you want to delete.
* Click **Delete account**, then click **Continue.**

Once your account is deleted, you can sign back up with the same username if it’s still available, if you have a change of heart.

**How to delete your Threads account**
--------------------------------------

Note: If you delete the Instagram account associated with your Threads profile, that will also delete your Threads profile.

But to delete only Threads, you’ll need to go to the Threads.net web page on a computer, and follow these steps:

* Click the two parallel lines in the bottom left of the page, then click **Settings.**
* Click **Account** at the top, then **Deactivate or delete profile.**
* Click **Delete profile.**
* Follow whatever prompts show up, then click **Delete Threads profile.**

It’ll take 30 days for the deletion request to go through. And if you want to sign back up with the same Instagram profile, you’ll have to wait 90 days.
