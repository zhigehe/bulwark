Elon Musk’s X has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $10 million to settle a lawsuit from the days when the company was still called Twitter and owned by Jack Dorsey, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/musks-x-agrees-to-pay-about-10-million-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-a38348f8?st=RnfS5s) citing unnamed sources.

The lawsuit took issue with Twitter’s decision to ban Trump after January 6, when Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Trump’s team reportedly considered letting its lawsuit against X peter out because of the President’s relationship with Musk, which has only grown closer over the past two years.

Musk [reinstated Trump’s Twitter account in 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/19/donald-trump-unbanned-twitter-elon-musk/), then [spent more than $250 million](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-trump-republican-super-pac-investment-78a725cb?mod=article_inline) on Trump’s 2024 Presidential campaign. This week, Musk and Trump held a joint press briefing from the Oval Office.

Despite the relationship with Musk, Trump moved forward with the settlement anyways. In January, [Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle a related lawsuit](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5279570/meta-trump-settlement-facebook-instagram-suspensions).
