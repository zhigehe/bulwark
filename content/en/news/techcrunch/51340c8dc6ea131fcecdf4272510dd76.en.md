Google Tuesday [confirmed](https://blog.google/feed/google-io-2025-save-the-date/) that its annual developer conference is set for May 20-21, 2025. The event will be held at the usual spot, Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheater, a few minutes — depending on traffic — from Google HQ.

The two-day event is a mix of both public- and developer-facing content. CEO Sundar Pichai will kick things off with a big keynote on the morning of Tuesday, May 20th, before making way for smaller breakout sessions for an army of developers.

[Last year’s show](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/google-i-o-2024-everything-announced-so-far/) was overloaded with news focused on Gemini, Google’s generative AI platform, and there’s no reason to expect this year to be any different. While I/O has centered around AI features the last several years, the space continues to heat up, thanks to competitors like OpenAI and DeepSeek.

For those who can’t wait a few months, the [I/O 2025](https://io.google/2025/) site is already up and running with some developer content from previous years, including [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma), [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat), and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/).

Developer season kicks off in full force with NVIDIA’s GTC on March 17-21, rounded out by Apple’s WWDC in June. This year, Google also has some stiff competition in the form of Microsoft Build, which [is set for](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/home) May 19-22 in Seattle.
