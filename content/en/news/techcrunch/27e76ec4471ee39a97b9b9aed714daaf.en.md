President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the company formerly known as Twitter appears to be over.

Trump sued the social media platform for banning him in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. While a federal judge [dismissed the suit](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/06/trump-twitter-ban-lawsuit/) in 2022, the then-former president’s lawyers [continued to appeal](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/04/appeals-court-doubtful-on-trumps-lawsuit-against-twitter-00119981).

Soon after the judge’s ruling, Elon Musk (who has become a key Trump ally) acquired Twitter (now known as X), and [reinstated Trump’s account](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/19/donald-trump-unbanned-twitter-elon-musk/). [Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/) and [other platforms](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/twitch-reinstates-trumps-account-ahead-of-the-2024-presidential-election/) subsequently reinstated Trump, as well — although he still does most of his social media posting on Truth Social, which is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group.

A [court filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25516072-trumptwittersettle020725/) states that all parties are asking the court to dismiss the case. The filing does not offer any details about the agreement between Trump and X, except to say that both sides will bear their own costs.

In January, [Meta agreed to pay $25 million](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5279570/meta-trump-settlement-facebook-instagram-suspensions) to settle a similar lawsuit over Trump’s ban from Instagram and Facebook.
