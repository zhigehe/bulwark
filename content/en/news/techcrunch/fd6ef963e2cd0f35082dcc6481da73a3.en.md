The big story

Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski posted in a February 8 [post on X](https://x.com/klarnaseb/status/1888328097998508453) that he and Klarna would “[embrace crypto](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/klarna-ceo-sebastian-siemiatkowski-says-firm-will-embrace-crypto/).” The Swedish buy now, pay later giant is also said to be planning a U.S. initial public offering in April with a target of a $15 billion valuation, according to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/aea83b1c-ae00-4769-81d3-bc7e194ff55d). Even though this would be about one-third lower than its [peak valuation of $45.6 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/) in 2021, it would still be “one of the biggest listings of the year,” reports FT. Klarna was [valued at $6.7 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/11/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b/) when it raised $800 million in 2022.

Dollars and cents

**Khazna**, an Egyptian fintech startup that offers financial services tailored toward low- and middle-income workers, recently [secured $16 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/egypts-khazna-banks-16m-for-its-financial-super-app-and-expansion-into-saudi/) in pre-Series B funding, bringing its total funding to over $63 million.

**Rapyd Financial Network** is [looking to raise $300 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/fintech-rapyd-seeks-funding-at-3-5b-valuation-a-steep-drop-from-9b/) in a new funding round that would value the global payments platform at $3.5 billion, a considerable decrease from its [approximately $9 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/) set in 2021.

Fintech-turned-HR outfit **Deel** is trying to lay the groundwork for an IPO. On February 4, it said its annual revenue run rate [climbed to $800 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/deel-unloads-300m-in-secondary-sale-brings-general-catalyst-on-as-an-investor/) in 2024 after growing by 70%. It also sold $300 million in secondary shares to General Catalyst and an unnamed “sovereign investor.”

**Superlogic**, a startup that helps give consumers a way to apply rewards points toward experiences such as courtside tickets to NBA games, has [raised $13.7 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/superlogic-raises-13-7m-at-a-200m-valuation-to-help-consumers-use-reward-points-toward-cool-experiences/) at a $200 million valuation.

A clearer picture of [**Bench**’s downfall](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/03/inside-the-wild-fall-and-last-minute-revival-of-bench-the-vc-backed-accounting-startup-that-imploded-over-the-holidays/) is emerging thanks to newly released [bankruptcy filings](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25513905-trustees-preliminary-report-dated-january-24-2024/). The records show that the Canada-based startup, which ironically enough offered cloud accounting software for small businesses, consistently struggled to reach profitability. It burned through $135 million from its founding in 2012 to September 2024. By the time of [its collapse](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/27/bench-shuts-down-leaving-thousands-of-businesses-without-access-to-accounting-and-tax-docs/), Bench was forced to shut down due to a “liquidity crisis,” the records say. The company has since been acquired by Employer.com. However, Bench’s bankruptcy offers a window into the dangers of too much debt for startups. Charles Rollet [takes a look](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/bench-burned-through-135-million-before-shutting-down/).

**Stripe** has [closed on its $1.1 billion purchase](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/stripe-makes-1-1-billion-crypto-bet-as-it-closes-on-bridge-acquisition/) of stablecoin platform Bridge — marking the payment giant’s [largest acquisition to date](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/stripe-in-talks-to-acquire-bridge-for-1-billion/) and tangible push into crypto.

In other Stripe news, TechCrunch learned that the payments giant has tapped Asya Bradley [to serve as its Startups and VC Partnerships lead](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/stripe-brings-aboard-new-head-of-startup-and-vc-partnerships/). Bradley previously held revenue roles at Synapse and Sila. She’s also an LP in venture funds Ganas Ventures and Cowboy Ventures.

Philadelphia Eagles’ star running back Saquon Barkley has not only [become an investor in fintech startup](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/fintech-ramp-lands-eagles-saquon-barkley-as-investor-and-super-bowl-commercial-star/) **Ramp**, but he was also the star of the company’s first Super Bowl commercial.
