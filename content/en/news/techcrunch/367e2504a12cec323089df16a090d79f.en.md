If you want to relive Kendrick Lamar’s headline-making Super Bowl halftime show, Apple Music just dropped a replay of the performance in its surround sound-like Spatial Audio.

Since Apple currently sponsors the Super Bowl halftime show, the company has permission to republish these musical spectacles — but this is better than just a YouTube video of the event. Fans [complain](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1iluvjv/halftime_show_mix_is_bad/) each year about the TV broadcast’s poor sound mix of these highly anticipated performances, but Apple Music’s support for Dolby Atmos means fans can listen to the show in a format with more integrity.

Apple Music has uploaded each Super Bowl halftime show in Spatial Audio since 2023, when the company began sponsoring the event — so the recent shows from Rihanna and Usher are also available in better quality than the original broadcast.

Lamar took home five trophies at the Grammy Awards last week, including major wins for “Record of the Year” and “Song of the Year.” With twenty-two Grammys, Lamar is one of the most decorated musicians in the industry — but President Donald Trump wasn’t enthused with the rapper’s performance, [reportedly leaving](https://x.com/sama/status/1889059531625464090) the stadium in the middle of the politically-charged set.

While Lamar’s halftime show may have offered political statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently [donated $1 million](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-donates-1-million-trump-inauguration-1236265079/) to Trump’s inauguration fund. He sat behind the president on inauguration day alongside other tech bigwigs like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos who also donated millions.
