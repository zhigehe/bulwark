Brian Quintenz, who leads policy for Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto team, announced on Wednesday that he’s being tapped to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to his [X post](https://x.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1889702678852211005). And many in the VC industry appear to be thrilled about it.

The CFTC regulates the trading of commodity futures, options, and swaps, otherwise known as derivatives. It is also involved in the enforcement of regulations impacting some crypto.

He previously served as a commissioner for the CFTC during the first Trump administration, according to his [a16z biography](https://a16zcrypto.com/team/brian-quintenz/) and, prior to that, he founded the investment firm Saeculum Capital Management.

He joined a16z in 2021 as an advisory partner before becoming head of policy for its crypto arm.

His appointment received support from some big names in the industry. On X, many working for the a16z crypto arm sent their congratulations.

Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, [who reportedly met with President Trump](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-11-18-2024/card/exclusive-trump-to-meet-privately-with-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-DDkgF0xW1BW242rVeuqx) to discuss staff appointments, posted an X welcoming Quintenz to the CFTC.

Bobby Franklin, president of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), a lobbying group, released a statement in support of Quintenz’s nomination, saying his government and venture experience will “provide valuable perspectives as he helms a top regulatory body for the crypto market.”

His pending appointment comes at a time when the CFTC has been mired in controversy. The acting chair, Caroline Pham, recently removed the head of HR, and the [agency released a statement](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9048-25) that made allegations against this person. This after [Bloomberg reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cftc-acting-chair-pham-removes-204715906.html) that there were internal investigations going on at the agency.

Quintenz is the latest affiliate of a16z to find his way to the White House. The firm has become so involved with the Trump administration that co-founder Marc Andreessen, an ardent Trump supporter, is said to be quietly [helping with government staff recruitment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/13/andreessen-tech-industry-trump-administration-doge/).

Elsewhere, Sriram Krishnan, former general partner at a16z, is now a White House senior policy advisor; Scott Kupor, one of the firm’s managing partners, [was tapped to lead](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/23/trump-taps-silicon-valley-execs-for-key-administration-roles.html) the Office of Personnel Management, and [Jamie Sullivan](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-tech-people-helping-the-trump-administration-shake-up-government?rc=48qqgg), another investor at the firm, is [rumored to be advising](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-tech-people-helping-the-trump-administration-shake-up-government?rc=48qqgg) DOGE.
