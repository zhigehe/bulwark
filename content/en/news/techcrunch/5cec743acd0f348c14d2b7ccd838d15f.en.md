A former iOS engineer, who was sued by Apple for leaking confidential information to journalists, has issued an apology after the lawsuit against [him was dismissed](https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/07/former-leaker-sued-by-apple-has-now-apologized-as-the-lawsuit-is-dismissed/).

The lawsuit, which was filed last year, alleged that Andrew Aude sent thousands of messages to journalists at *The Wall Street Journal* and *The Information* about more than a half-dozen different Apple policies and products, including details about Apple’s Journal app and its Vision Pro headset.

“I spent nearly eight years as a software engineer at Apple,” Aude said in an [apology posted to X](https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500?s=61&t=a-bloX1n-TZ50ofqhetO1A). “During that time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple information, including what were then unreleased products and features. But instead of keeping this information secret, I made the mistake of sharing this information with journalists who covered the company. I did not realize it at the time, but this turned out to be a profound and expensive mistake.”

“Leaking was not worth it,” he continued. “I sincerely apologize to my former colleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple, but work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.”
