The $60 billion mega-merger between Honda and Nissan has been called off, in part because of Nissan’s “pride and insufficient alarm about its predicament,” [writes Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/inside-collapse-nissan-hondas-60-billion-mega-deal-2025-02-12/), citing half a dozen sources.

The report hints at bad blood on both sides, saying the development also ties to Honda abruptly revising the terms of the merger and proposing that Nissan become a subsidiary. Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, which has recently forayed into EVs, has [said it may be interested in buying a stake](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/foxconns-aim-is-cooperation-with-nissan-not-acquisition-2025-02-12/) in Nissan now that the merger is off.

The two Japanese automakers revealed last year that they were considering ways to work together and formally announced the merger talks [in December](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/inside-collapse-nissan-hondas-60-billion-mega-deal-2025-02-12/). Their overarching goal was to better survive the “[dramatic changes](https://global.honda/en/newsroom/news/2024/c241223ceng.html)” in the automotive industry.

If they had come together, they would have created the world’s third-largest automaker. The two companies were also considering folding in Mitsubishi, which — along with French automaker Renault — is currently in a strategic alliance with Nissan.
