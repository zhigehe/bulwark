Blue Origin is laying off 10% of its workforce, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/bezos-blue-origin-layoff-about-10-across-its-space-launch-business-2025-02-13/), just one month after the successful first launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket. The company [reportedly](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-hiring-booms-spacex-blue-hard.html) has more than 10,000 employees, meaning the cut could affect around 1,000 people.

CEO Dave Limp told employees in an all-hands meeting on Thursday morning that the company is not “set up for the kind of success that we really wanted to have,” which he said was a “painful conclusion,” [according](https://x.com/joroulette/status/1890054470685569140) to Reuters reporter Joey Roulette. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Limp [took over](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/25/amazons-outgoing-echo-head-is-blue-origins-new-ceo/) as Blue Origin CEO in 2023, after running Amazon’s devices and services division for more than a decade. Prior to Limp taking over that role, Blue Origin — and the New Glenn program in particular — was [moving slowly and was beset with delays](https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/after-the-success-of-new-glenn-blue-origin-to-focus-on-launching-frequently/), all while SpaceX gobbled up the market for launching things and people into space.
