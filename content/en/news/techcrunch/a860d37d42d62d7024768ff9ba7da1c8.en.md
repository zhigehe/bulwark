Apple Maps will soon rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, [following similar changes made by Google this week](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/google-changed-the-gulf-of-mexico-to-the-gulf-of-america-on-maps/), in order to comply with U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order that officially changed the name.

U.S.-based Apple users may see the “Gulf of America” as soon as Tuesday, [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/apple-is-renaming-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-on-maps-app), and the company will soon roll out the name to users in other countries.

Google Maps users around the world already see the split name, “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” when viewing the body of water, whereas Mexican and American users see their country’s respective names.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum [sent a letter to Google asking the company to reconsider](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/mexican-president-pushes-back-against-googles-renaming-of-gulf-of-mexico/) renaming the gulf. However, Apple and Google seem to be following orders from the sitting U.S. President.
