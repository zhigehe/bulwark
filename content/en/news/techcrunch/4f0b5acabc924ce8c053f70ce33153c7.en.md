Fine art auction house, Christie’s, [has sold AI-generated art before](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/eerie-ai-generated-portrait-fetches-432500-at-auction/). But soon, it plans to hold its first show dedicated solely to works created with AI, an announcement that has been met with mixed reviews.

The auction, [which Christie’s is calling ‘Augmented Intelligence](https://x.com/ChristiesInc/status/1887864091839963320),’ will feature artwork from artists including Mat Dryhurst, the founder of AI startup, [Spawning AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/spawning-wants-to-build-more-ethical-ai-training-data-sets/). A robot that paints live is set to be the exhibition’s centerpiece at Christie’s Rockefeller Center galleries in New York, beginning February 20.

Critics argued that shows like Augmented Intelligence put this work on a pedestal, at the expense of those creating art by hand.

We’ve reached out to Christie’s for comment and will update this post if we hear back.
