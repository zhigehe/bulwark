Startups took different views on the recurring dilemma of whether to partner or not. Plus, a cautionary tale on high burn rates, and IPOs ahead.

**Joining forces**: Following a similar partnership with Aurora Innovation, Volvo Autonomous Solutions [partnered with self-driving truck startup Waabi](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/waabi-and-volvo-team-up-to-build-self-driving-trucks-at-scale/) to jointly develop and deploy autonomous trucks. Commercial pilots are set to launch in Texas soon, with a driverless demonstration on public roads planned for the end of the year.

And space startups OurSky and PlaneWave [merged to create Observable Space](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/two-space-startups-have-merged-to-create-the-next-generation-of-telescopes/), a new company that aims to create the next generation of telescopes.

**Going solo**: Robotics company Figure AI [exited its deal with OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/figure-drops-openai-in-favor-of-in-house-models/), choosing instead to focus on in-house AI owing to a “major breakthrough.” The startup is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot for commercial and residential use.

And Google’s X [spun out Heritable Agriculture](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/google-x-spins-out-heritable-agriculture-a-startup-using-ai-to-improve-crop-yield/), a startup using AI to improve crop yield. The “moonshot factory” has been spinning off several ventures under the leadership of Astro Teller.

**Takeover:** XOi,a startup that builds software for maintenance people, [acquired competitor Specifx](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/xoi-raises-230m-acquires-specifx-to-expand-its-tech-for-field-service-technicians/) to expand its datasets on repairs. The acquisition was made for an undisclosed sum and funded by a $230 million round that the company also announced this week.

**High burn**: Failed Canada-based accounting startup Bench [burned through $135 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/bench-burned-through-135-million-before-shutting-down/) over the years before filing for bankruptcy, records revealed.

**IPOs ahead**: TechCrunch compiled a list of [tech companies that could go public this year](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/here-are-all-the-ipos-reported-to-be-in-the-works-for-2025/), including two space and defense tech startups that filed to go public last month: Karman and Voyager Technologies. Deel was not on the list, but a [major secondary sale](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/deel-unloads-300m-in-secondary-sale-brings-general-catalyst-on-as-an-investor/) suggests that the IPO the fintech/HR startup previously teased for “the 2025/2026 time frame” is getting closer.
