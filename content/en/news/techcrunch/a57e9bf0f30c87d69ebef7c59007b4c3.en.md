Valve removed a game from its Steam video game platform and store because it contained malware, according to [media](https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware) [reports](https://www.thegamer.com/piratefi-steam-malware-game-taken-down-valve-warns-players-reset-pc/). In its notice to users who downloaded the game, Valve said affected users may want to “consider fully reformatting your operating system.”

The game was called [PirateFi](https://steamdb.info/app/3476470/), and billed itself as “a thrilling survival game set in a vibrant, low-poly world where you can choose to play solo or with others in multiplayer mode.” It’s not known exactly how many people downloaded the game, but its store rating had a 9/10 score out of 51 reviews, according to [an archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20250208024134/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476470/PirateFi/) of its Steam page seen by TechCrunch.

Valve removed the game this week, as reported by PCMag. [A post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1inniw1/a_game_called_piratefi_released_on_steam_last/) showed the message that the company sent to players who downloaded the game.

In the notice to users, Valve said it had removed the affected game builds from steam, but said it urged users to “run a full-system scan using an anti-virus product that you trust or use regularly, and inspect your system for unexpected or newly installed software.” Valve said a full system reset would “ensure that no malicious software remains on your machine.”

Valve did not specify the kind of malware found in the game. A spokesperson for Valve did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The Steam app, as well as video games themselves, typically have deep access to gamers’ devices, making malware targeting gamers particularly appealing to hackers. Last year, [TechCrunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/activision-says-its-investigating-password-stealing-malware-targeting-game-players/) that hackers were targeting gamers with an [infostealer malware](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#infostealers), a campaign that Activision was investigating. In 2023, [hackers were found infecting players](http://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/hackers-are-infecting-call-of-duty-players-with-a-self-spreading-malware/) of an old Call of Duty game with a self-spreading malware.

As a result of what is [one of the most brazen hacks in the video-gaming world](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/apex-legends-hacker-said-he-hacked-tournament-games-for-fun/), Electronic Arts [had to postpone an Apex Legends esports tournament](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/esports-league-postponed-after-players-hacked-midgame/) after a hacker took control of the gamers’ computers during a match to make it look like they were cheating.
