Just six months after defense tech Anduril [raised a massive $1.5 billion round](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/07/anduril-raises-1-5b-to-hyper-scale-defense-production/) that valued the company at $14 billion, it’s in talks to raise another $2.5 billion, at a valuation of up to $28 billion, sources [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/07/anduril-reportedly-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding-round-that-could-double-valuation.html).

The deal would, not surprisingly, be led by Founders Fund, which is reportedly writing a $1 billion check that represents its largest check ever. While Anduril founder Palmer Luckey is the face of the company, it names five men as co-founders, among them Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. Founders Fund has been an investor in Anduril from the start, leading its seed round in 2017. It also co-led Anduril’s 2024 financing.

That previous round was to help pay for Anduril’s [billion-dollar weapons megafactory it is building in Ohio](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/anduril-to-build-its-billion-dollar-weapons-megafactory-in-ohio/). Sources also told CNBC that the company’s [2024 revenue doubled to $1 billion.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/anduril-salaries-palmer-luckey-other-execs-how-much-do-they-make/) Anduril declined further comment.
