Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth has choice words for Meta employees frustrated with the tech giant’s latest policies: they are free to quit, [Business Insider reported.](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-cto-employees-disagree-policy-changes-quit-2025-2)

The report cites an internal chat where an employee criticized Meta for [cutting DEI programs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/meta-eliminates-dei-programs/) and allegedly silencing internal dissent, among other issues.

Bosworth responded that any staffer who thinks it’s OK to leak to the media because of policy disagreements “should consider working elsewhere.”

An employee followed up that blaming leaks was not the answer, and that Meta workers felt disrespected. (Meta [began layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/meta-to-cut-roughly-5-of-its-workforce-based-on-performance/) this week for what it has [controversially](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-surprise-employees-strong-performers-2025-2) termed “low performers.”)

Bosworth responded that, “You should quit if you feel that way, I mean it.”

The tense conversation reflects some degree of internal turmoil at Meta as it implements significant policy changes, from [rolling back DEI efforts](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/meta-eliminates-dei-programs/) to [loosening moderation standards](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/).

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
