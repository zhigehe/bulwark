OpenAI has eliminated a page on its website that used to express its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The URL “<https://openai.com/commitment-to-dei/>” now redirects to “<https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/>,” a page that talks about people with “different backgrounds” with no use of the word diversity.

The previous page stated that the company’s “investment in diversity, equity and inclusion” was ongoing. It also said that it was [serious about this work](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/openai-responds-to-congressional-black-caucus-about-lack-of-diversity-on-its-board/) and was committed to “continuously improving our work in creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization,” as captured by the Internet Web Archive and also as cited [by a 2023 CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/tech/openai-board-diversity/index.html).

It isn’t clear exactly when this change was made, but there’s some evidence it was very recent. The diversity commitment webpage [was cited as available by an ABC News story](https://abcnews.go.com/US/tech-firms-trumps-ai-stargate-venture-touted-dei/story?id=117996988) published on January 22. By January 27, OpenAI [had published](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1883855755436245201) the new, replacement “[building dynamic teams](https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/)” webpage.

The new page says, “At OpenAI, we recognize that the strongest ideas emerge when they are tested, debated, and improved by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. We encourage a culture of curiosity where ideas can be challenged—not just accepted.”

OpenAI did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the website change or if it indicates any of the company’s internal processes have been rolled back or altered. OpenAI’s web page that [promises “fairness”](https://openai.com/index/evaluating-fairness-in-chatgpt/) in model training to remove social biases is still live, for instance.

OpenAI is hardly the only company to distance itself from the wording of DEI as these specific words – as well as the concepts behind them – face fierce political and legal backlash these days. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi [instructed](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388501/dl?inline) the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds.

In the past month, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all announced the elimination or adjustment of DEI policies, with the latter two [scrubbing mention](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/amazon-deletes-inclusion-and-diversity-language-in-latest-filing/) of diversity and inclusion from their recent 10-K forms.   
OpenAI is working with the government in a few capacities. For instance, It secured [a government contract](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107897/openais-new-defense-contract-completes-its-military-pivot/) and launched a [chatbot for government agencies.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-launches-chatgpt-gov-us-government-agencies-amid-rising-ai-competition-2025-01-28/)
