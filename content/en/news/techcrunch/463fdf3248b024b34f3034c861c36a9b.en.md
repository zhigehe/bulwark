Apple could launch a new [iPhone SE](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/the-iphone-se-is-the-platonic-ideal-of-a-smartphone/) and [PowerBeats Pro](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/trying-out-beats-fully-wireless-powerbeats-pro/) headphones as early as February 11, according to [reporting from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/apple-s-long-awaited-overhaul-of-budget-iphone-nears-release). The announcement is likely to be on the smaller side, given that the company has not yet issued invites for either an in-person or virtual event.

A new iPhone SE would mark the fourth generation of Apple’s more budget-minded handset, as well as the first in the line to be released since 2022. At the time, the third-generation device, which was part of the larger iPhone 13 portfolio, sported a $429 price tag and features that are similar to the iPhone 8, including a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. That product has already been discontinued in the EU owing its Lightning port, which doesn’t adhere to [Common Charger Directive legislation](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/eu-common-charger-usb-c/).

As with the rest of Apple’s product line, a new iPhone SE would almost certainly sport a USB-C port. The handset is rumored to resemble the iPhone 14 line, which arrived months after the last SE. The refresh likely marks the official end of iPhone’s Touch ID home button, as the feature is supplanted by Face ID biometrics.

Notably, the fourth-gen iPhone SE is believed to be [Apple Intelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/what-is-apple-intelligence-when-is-coming-and-who-will-get-it/)-compatible, joining all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro. It could also be the first device to sport an Apple-built, in-house modem, as the company continues to lessen its dependency on third-party chip makers like Qualcomm.

The new SE is expected to see big adoption outside the U.S., specifically in China and India, which are currently ranked the world’s first and second-biggest smartphone markets, respectively. China has long been a key market for Apple, though the company has struggled in the country in recent quarters. During its last earnings report, it revealed that iPhone sales in China have [slipped 11% year-over-year](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/apple-quarterly-revenue-increases-even-as-china-sales-decline-11/).

That drop was due in large part to the continued growth of domestic manufacturers, including Huawei, which has rebounded following trade restrictions imposed during the first Trump administration. Also at play is the fact that Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to generative AI, is not currently available in China.

Apple is believed to be announcing the PowerBeats Pro 2 in tandem with the iPhone SE. The Beats-branded headphones would arrive nearly six years after the first-generation product. The new Bluetooth earbuds are expected to be the first Apple-branded headphones with built-in heart rate tracking, as the company looks to grow its wearable health initiative beyond the Apple Watch.

Later this year, Apple is expected to issue [M4](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/apple-upgrades-macbook-pro-with-m4-chips/) refreshes to the MacBook Air and iPad Air, along with a long-rumored addition to the company’s smart home line. The new home hub is said to include a display and may also mark Apple’s first step into consumer robotics. None of these products are expected for the February 11 launch, however.
