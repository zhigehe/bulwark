Amazon is the latest tech company to remove references to “inclusion and diversity” from its [10-K report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/e42c2068-bad5-4ab6-ae57-36ff8b2aeffd.pdf). The filing has removed reference to diversity and inclusion as it pertains to the workplace.

In its [2023 10-K form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/c7c14359-36fa-40c3-b3ca-5bf7f3fa0b96.pdf), the company had a sentence that read “As we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent.” In its [2024 10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/e42c2068-bad5-4ab6-ae57-36ff8b2aeffd.pdf), that sentence was greatly reduced to simply read “We strive to be Earth’s best employer.” The only reference to “diversity,” was in regard to product categories, and matters related to “inclusion” concerned stock awards.

Amazon did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

TechCrunch reported that Google [also removed mention](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/pinterest-lists-dei-attacks-as-possible-business-risk-latest-filing/) of diversity in its latest 10-K filing, compared to its 2023 form. Amazon recently [announced it would curb](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/amazon-curbs-some-dei-programs/) some of its DEI programs, following in the footsteps of [Meta](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/meta-eliminates-dei-programs/) and now also [Google](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/google-ditches-dei-hiring-goals/). Amazon told employees it would review its initiatives and wind down some programs. DEI has come under fierce scrutiny this past year, as conservative groups have sought to [sue companies with DEI programs.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/dei-backlash-stay-up-to-date-on-the-latest-legal-and-corporate-challenges/#:~:text=Venture-,DEI%20backlash%3A%20Stay%20up-to-date%20on%20the,latest%20legal%20and%20corporate%20challenges&text=The%20Great%20Rollback%20is%20here,the%20murder%20of%20George%20Floyd.)

The Trump administration is also not a fan of DEI and [has banned it](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5271588/trump-dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-federal-workers-government) from the federal government; U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi [also instructed](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388501/dl?inline) the Department of Justice this week to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI” programs and activities in the private sector companies that receive federal funds.
