While large corporations like Google and Meta curbing their DEI programs, Ulu Ventures, which just raised a fourth [$208 million fund](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ulu-ventures-raises-208-million-for-fourth-fund-amid-dei-backlash-717c7fe2?tpl=vc&mod=hp_lead_pos1), doesn’t plan to change its strategy of investing in diverse founders, the firm told the Wall Street Journal.

Co-founded by Miriam Riviera, a Latina and former vice president and deputy general counsel at Google, Ulu uses a data-driven investment approach to filter out biases.

The 17-year-old firm investing in seed startups is mindful that continuing diversity efforts may raise risks under the new administration. “If you are going to be standing strong on DEI today, you have to be incredibly buttoned-up,” one of the firm’s partners told WSJ, implying that investing based on data doesn’t mean the firm favors specific founder demographics.

Ulu’s limited partners seem to be onboard with its approach to diversity. The firm’s fourth fund is 50% larger than its third $138 million fund raised in 2021.
