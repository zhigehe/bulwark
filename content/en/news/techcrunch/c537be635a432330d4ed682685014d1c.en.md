Public semiconductor company Arm will start making its own chips this year after landing a high-profile enterprise customer.

Arm, which is majorly owned by SoftBank, [will start making its own chips now that Meta has signed on](https://www.ft.com/content/95367b2b-2aa7-4a06-bdd3-0463c9bad008) as a customer, according to the Financial Times. The chip is expected to be a CPU for servers in large data centers and can be customized for various customers. Arm will outsource its production.

The first in-house Arm chip will be unveiled as early as this summer, the Financial Times also reported.

This is a notable change in strategy for the semiconductor company, which usually licenses its chip blueprints to companies like Apple and Nvidia. Making its own chips will turn some of its existing customers into competitors.

TechCrunch reached out to both Meta and Arm for comment and will update the story if we hear back.
