Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD unveiled “God’s Eye,” an advanced driver assistance system that will be install on its entire model lineup, including its $9,600 Seagull hatchback.

BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said at a live streamed event Monday that “we’re entering an era where autonomous driving is for everyone,” according to [The Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/ef36aff7-6be4-4cb5-9928-33beabf6c443).

God’s Eye performs automated driving functions typically reserved for luxury EVs, including tasks such as remote parking via smartphone app and highway autonomous navigation.

BYD is Tesla’s biggest rival in China, which is the American automaker’s second-largest market. BYD’s offering comes as Tesla as the company attempts to win over Beijing regulators’ approval to deploy its “Full Self-Driving” technology.

BYD also on Monday joined a cohort of local automakers including Geely, Great Wall Motor, and Leapmotor to integrate Chinese AI startup [DeepSeek’s](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/) AI into its vehicle systems.
