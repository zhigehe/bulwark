After the PlayStation Network [experienced a global outage](https://www.theverge.com/news/608946/playstation-network-down-outage) that lasted for nearly a day, Sony says it will compensate PlayStation Plus subscribers by giving them an extra five days of service.

The outage seems to have lasted from Friday evening until Saturday evening in the United States, with many PlayStation owners reporting difficulty loading their digital games or connecting with friends online. [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/) shows that outage reports peaked at around midday Saturday on the East Coast before falling throughout the afternoon and evening.

The Ask PlayStation account on X [posted](https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758) at around 7pm that “PSN has been restored,” following up five hours later with [a message](https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888376843255824475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1888376843255824475%7Ctwgr%5E9d00d545f0c1d23c50f605dbf6af1303250f7908%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F608946%2Fplaystation-network-down-outage) that “network services have fully recovered from an operational issue.”

“We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience,” the account said. “All PlayStation Plus members will automatically receive an additional 5 days of service.”
