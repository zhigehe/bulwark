Cap table management firm Carta [made headlines](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/cartas-former-marketing-vp-who-spearheaded-its-report-on-pay-inequality-is-suing-over-gender-discrimination/) in 2020 when its former marketing VP Emily Kramer filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination and retaliation.

That case was [settled](https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-executive-2023-2) in 2023. But since then, Carta has settled two other lawsuits filed by women who worked at the firm and alleged sexual harassment and discrimination, legal filings seen by TechCrunch show.

On January 9, 2025, Carta [settled](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25512950-09405456/) a 2023 lawsuit from former sales manager Alexandra Rogers, who [alleged](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25516026-08677589/) that Carta’s CRO Jeff Perry groped her thigh and her leg on two separate occasions. She was fired less than 2 months after reporting the alleged sexual harassment to HR, the complaint alleges.

Carta and Perry — who was personally named in Rogers’ complaint — have strongly denied any wrongdoing. Perry filed a defamation counter complaint in October 2023 against Rogers. That case is now fully dismissed following the settlement. Carta confirmed to TechCrunch that the matter has been confidentially resolved without any admission of liability.

“Carta has always been committed to equality in the workplace and fair treatment of all its employees,” Carta VP Communications Amanda Taggart told TechCrunch. Rogers’ lawyers did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch.

The Rogers case marks the third time Carta settled a lawsuit from a former female employee in San Francisco’s Superior court.

Carta also settled a complaint from a former account executive named Amanda Sheets in November 2023, [according to another legal filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25515228-08821593/), TechCrunch is reporting for the first time.

In [her complaint](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25515245-08549878/), Sheets claimed she was fired for trying to work remotely despite suffering from chronic migraines, while some of her male co-workers had been allowed to work from home without any issues. Sheets alleged she was denied accommodations for her disability and was the subject of sex discrimination.

Sheets’ complaint (like Rogers’) named Perry personally, based on him allegedly working on her remote request and asking her to fill out a new form. Carta, which denies Sheets’ claims, strongly disputes Perry’s inclusion in the suit and filed a motion to have Perry dismissed from the case altogether, it told TechCrunch.

However, before a ruling on that motion was made, all parties agreed to settle. Sheets’ lawyers did not return a request for comment.

Carta has previously come under scrutiny for how women and others are treated at the company.

In 2020, current and former employees [told The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/business/carta-workers-inequality.html) they had been sidelined, demoted, or given pay cuts after voicing concerns about the way the company is run. In 2023, Business Insider [reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10) that Carta had hired someone in 2020 to clean up a “toxic, boys club” culture at the firm (in that employee’s words.)

But Ward [went on the offensive](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/cartas-ceo-reaches-out-to-customers-about-bad-press-alerting-them-to-bad-press/) in 2023, [publishing a Medium post](https://henrysward.medium.com/what-i-tell-employees-about-negative-press-7c134e7a601c) implying he’s been targeted by ambitious reporters who want to build up their careers by exposing “bad behavior” at companies. His post [was criticized](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/cartas-ceo-reaches-out-to-customers-about-bad-press-alerting-them-to-bad-press/) for inadvertently alerting people to bad press about Carta.
