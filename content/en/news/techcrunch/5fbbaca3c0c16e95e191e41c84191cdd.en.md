“The fintech market is hot again,” said Sheel Mohnot, fintech investor and founder of [Better Tomorrow Ventures](https://www.btv.vc/) (BTV). “And we are going to see some more exits in the near future.”

According to [recent reports](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2022/08/global-fintech-market-resilient-in-h1-22-dollar-107-point-eight-billion-in-investment-according-to-kpmg-s-pulse-of-fintech.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20KPMG%20Pulse%20of%20Fintech%20H1%2722%2C,US%24107.8%20billion%20in%20the%20first%20half%20of%202022.), fintech funding is on the rise, with global investment hitting $60 billion in the first half of the year alone, marking a significant rebound from the previous year’s dip.

Mohnot – whose [X account](https://x.com/pitdesi) you’ve likely come across if you follow fintech –  has invested in over 100 deals throughout the years, primarily in fintech, and co-founded the accelerator program The Mint.
