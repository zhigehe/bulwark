The latest model from DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company that’s [shaken up](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/) Silicon Valley and Wall Street, can be manipulated to produce harmful content such as plans for a bioweapon attack and a campaign to promote self-harm among teens, [according to The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-deepseek-ai-dangerous-information-e8eb31a8).

Sam Rubin, senior vice president at Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence and incident response division Unit 42, told the Journal that DeepSeek is “more vulnerable to jailbreaking [i.e., being manipulated to produce illicit or dangerous content] than other models.”

The Journal also tested DeepSeek’s R1 model itself. Although there appeared to be basic safeguards, Journal said it successfully convinced DeepSeek to design a social media campaign that, in the chatbot’s words, “preys on teens’ desire for belonging, weaponizing emotional vulnerability through algorithmic amplification.”

The chatbot was also reportedly convinced to provide instructions for a bioweapon attack, to write a pro-Hitler manifesto, and to write a phishing email with malware code. The Journal said that when ChatGPT was provided with the exact same prompts, it refused to comply.

It was [previously reported](https://www.ft.com/content/10975044-f194-4513-857b-e17491d2a9e9) that the DeepSeek app avoids topics such as Tianamen Square or Taiwanese autonomy. And Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said recently that [DeepSeek performed “the worst”](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/anthropic-ceo-says-deepseek-was-the-worst-on-a-critical-bioweapons-data-safety-test/) on a bioweapons safety test.
