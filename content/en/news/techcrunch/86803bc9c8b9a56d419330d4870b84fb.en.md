U.K.-headquartered cybersecurity firm Sophos is laying off 6% of its workforce, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday.

The layoffs, first reported by [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/13/sophos_secureworks_layoff/), come less than two weeks after Sophos completed its $859 million acquisition of U.S. cybersecurity company Secureworks.

In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Sophos spokesperson Sara Eberle said the layoffs will affect “roughly 6% of our combined companies.” Sophos declined to confirm the exact number of employees that had been affected and would not disclose the company’s current headcount.

Sophos said the workforce reduction is due to “positions that are no longer needed when Secureworks delisted as a public company and streamlining duplicative roles as a result of the acquisition.”

In 2023, [Sophos laid off 10% of its workforce](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/sophos-global-layoffs/) — approximately 450 employees — which the company said at the time was to achieve “the optimal balance of growth and profitability.”
