AI startup Anthropic is gearing up to release its next major AI model, [according to a report Thursday from The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-strikes-back).

The report describes Anthropic’s upcoming model as a “hybrid” model that can switch between “deep reasoning” and fast responses. The company will reportedly introduce a “sliding scale” alongside the model to allow developers to control costs, as the deep reasoning capabilities consume more computing.

Anthropic’s model, which could arrive within weeks, outperforms OpenAI’s [o3-mini-high “reasoning” model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model/) on some programming tasks, according to the report. The model is also said to excel at analyzing large codebases and other business-related benchmarks.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei hinted at new models in an [interview on Monday](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-says-were-in-a-race-to-understand-ai-as-it-becomes-more-powerful/) with TechCrunch’s Romain Dillet.

“We’re generally focused on trying to make our own take on reasoning models that are better differentiated,” Amodei told Dillet. “We’ve been a little bit puzzled by the idea that there are normal models and there are reasoning models and that they’re sort of different from each other.”
