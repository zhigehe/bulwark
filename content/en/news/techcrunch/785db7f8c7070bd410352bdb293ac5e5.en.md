The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has reportedly placed several members of its election security team on administrative leave.

[The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-kristi-noem-cybersecurity-5bac8ce416c46b4fbe44c94ae5874b39), citing a person familiar with the situation, reports that 17 CISA employees have been placed on leave pending review.

The employees had worked with election officials to counter a range of cybersecurity threats, including ransomware and the physical security of election workers. According to the report, 10 of the employees were regional security election officials hired to bolster election security ahead of the 2024 election.

The reported move comes amid uncertainty about the future of CISA, which was formed in 2018 during the first Trump administration. President Trump has not yet named a replacement for former CISA director [Jen Easterly, who departed the agency on January 20](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/cisa-director-jen-easterly-to-depart-agency-on-january-20/).

When reached for comment, CISA deferred to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Public Affairs, which did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions.
