[In an interview](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/elon-musk-led-team-submits-97-4b-bid-for-openai/) at the AI Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Elon Musk’s [unsolicited $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI’s nonprofit](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/elon-musk-led-team-submits-97-4b-bid-for-openai/) as “an attempt to slow [OpenAI] down.”

“[Musk] obviously is a competitor,” [Altman said](https://x.com/slow_developer/status/1889277752454402556). “He’s raised a lot of money for [his AI company] xAI, and they’re trying to compete with us from a technological perspective.”

Altman went on to quip, “I think [Musk’s] whole life is from a position of insecurity […] I don’t think he’s a happy person.”

Altman almost immediately shot down Musk’s offer for OpenAI’s nonprofit in a public post on Monday, and it seems increasingly likely that OpenAI’s board of directors [will formally reject the bid](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-says-board-will-reject-musks-97-billion-offer). But it may not happen right away. [In an interview on Tuesday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/openai-director-larry-summers-says-he-has-not-received-musk-bid?embedded-checkout=true&sref=25o06hnO), Larry Summers, an OpenAI board member, said he hadn’t received “any formal communication [about the bid] of any kind outside of media reports.”
