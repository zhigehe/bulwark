[Mattoboard](https://mattoboard.com/), the makers of web-based software designed to simplify the creative process for interior designers and architects, is getting into AI. On Tuesday, the startup announced its $2 million seed funding round, which will support the launch of a new feature called Design Stream, an AI-driven visual search and discovery tool.

The company’s software, a “3D [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)” of sorts, allows users to mix and match over 1,000 virtual materials, create mood boards, and provides a centralized hub for experimenting with design ideas across multiple projects.

Although the Architecture and Design services industry was estimated to be worth [$201.97 billion](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/architectural-services-global-market-report) in 2024, Mattoboard asserts that the current product curation method is outdated, with designers having to order and wait for physical samples to ship, delaying their creative process.

Designers also order far more samples than they need, contributing to the [92 million tons](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/08/textile-recycling-create-jobs-reduce-pollution) of waste generated annually by the textile industry.

With Mattoboard, users can show their clients digital concepts before ordering approved samples, making the process both faster and more efficient.

Soon, the company will add a new AI tool called “Design Stream,” enabling designers to search for specific products more efficiently using natural language and visual inputs.

With Design Stream, designers will be able to articulate their vision in their own words and receive recommendations tailored to their specific needs. Mattoboard plans to train its own custom AI models specific to the design industry, as it believes the large foundational models currently available are too generalized.

Founded in 2022, the startup is led by Guy Adam Ailion (CEO), an architect and designer with over 20 years of experience, recognized for designing and building the award-winning [IO House](https://ksrarchitects.com/architecture-project/io-house/) in London. Alion is joined by George Hart (CTO), who previously co-founded Hometapper.

“Architects and designers waste 40% of their time just searching for products and materials,” Ailion told TechCrunch. “I realized this segment of the A&D workflow was ripe for disruption and long overdue for digital transformation. There had to be a better way to find, manage, store, and curate the world’s interior materials and products.”

One notable feature in Mattoboard is its use of 3D twins for materials, which simulates real life by capturing how surfaces and textures interact with light, shadow, and reflections. When users move around an object on the board, adjusting the angles and watching how surfaces react, they can better understand the design aesthetics. Users can also upload images of their own products to add to their 3D mood boards.

Designers often use a combination of rival platforms for their workflow, such as Canva for design, Pinterest for mood boarding, and Photoshop or 3D renderers for visualization. Mattoboard aims to consolidate all of these tools into a single platform while also incorporating a search function that allows users to discover and buy materials and products.

Additionally, users don’t need to be professionals to navigate the platform. During our tests, TechCrunch found it to be fairly user-friendly, making it accessible for beginners, hobbyists, and students.

Since its launch, around 200,000 designers have been utilizing the free platform. Mattoboard also has a paid Pro version for $30/month, which is being used by over 2,000 paying designers.

The latest round was led by Acrobator Ventures, with participation from Home Depot Ventures and Masco. The new capital will also be used to expand its material database and partner with global suppliers with the aim of “bringing every material in the world online,” Ailion said.
