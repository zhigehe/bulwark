You can now dine out on dishes inspired by Netflix movies and shows at Las Vegas’s newest restaurant. [Netflix Bites](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-opens-restaurant-mgm-grand-153230730.html) is open as of this week in the MGM Grand Hotel & Casio, where it will operate for a year. The restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner options like a *Bridgerton*-inspired tea service, Stranger Wings, nachos crafted by *Wednesday*‘s Thing, *DIY Nailed It*! cakes, and an assortment of drinks, like a “Love is Blind” cocktail where you combine flavors for a surprise.

This isn’t the first time Netflix has gotten into food service — a Netflix Bites restaurant was previously open as a pop-up for a month in L.A. in 2023. But this new year-long residency in a travel hotspot will offer broader reach and more marketing opportunities.

Netflix has been expanding more into in-person experiences in recent years, including with live events like The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience; Stranger Things: The Experience; and Squid Game: The Experience, now open in New York, Madrid, and Sydney. Another, Netflix House, is coming to Dallas and Philadelphia in 2025
