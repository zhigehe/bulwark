OpenAI says it has spoken to government officials about its ongoing investigation into DeepSeek.

The ChatGPT-maker previously claimed to have evidence that [DeepSeek trained its AI models using improperly obtained data from OpenAI’s API.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/openai-deepseek-data-harvest.html) During a [Bloomberg TV interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/openai-has-spoken-to-government-officials-about-deepseek-probe?srnd=phx-technology) on Monday, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, said the company has talked with government officials about the probe.

Some have criticized OpenAI for hypocrisy here. Several publishers are suing the startup for training their AI models on copyrighted works. But now, OpenAI is targeting DeepSeek for apparently training on its AI model outputs.

Lehane said there’s a difference. He likened OpenAI’s training methods to reading a library book and learning from it, whereas DeepSeek’s methods are more like putting a new cover on a library book, and selling it as your own.

The latter is not far off from [the New York Times’ argument in its copyright case](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/) against OpenAI.
