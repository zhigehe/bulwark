Welcome back to Week in Review. This week we‚Äôre diving into Google quietly removing its pledge to not build AI weapons for surveillance; how Elon Musk and DOGE are facilitating the biggest breach of U.S. government data; researchers who were able to re-create a premium ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù model for $50; and more! Let‚Äôs get into it.

**Representatives of Elon Musk and DOGE** were granted [‚Äúfull access‚Äù to the U.S. Treasury payments system](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/senator-warns-of-national-security-risks-after-elon-musks-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems/), which is used to disperse trillions of dollars to Americans each year. SenatorRon Wyden warned that Musk‚Äôs access to the system poses a ‚Äú[national security risk](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/).‚Äù It‚Äôs the latest reported effort by Musk to infiltrate the inner workings of the federal government.In response, U.S. Democratic Representative Mark Pocan [proposed a bill called the Elon Musk Act,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-elon-musk-act-aims-to-ban-special-government-employees-from-having-federal-contracts/) which stands for Eliminate Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy.

**One of Meta‚Äôs earliest employees** is suing the company for [sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/early-meta-employee-sues-for-sexual-harassment-gender-discrimination/) Kelly Stonelake, who spent 15 years at the company, alleges that Meta failed to take action after she reported sexual harassment and assault; retaliated against her after she flagged a video game product as racist and potentially harmful to minors; and was routinely passed over for promotions in favor of men on her team.

**Google removed a pledge** to not build [AI for weapons or surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/google-removes-pledge-to-not-use-ai-for-weapons-from-website/) from its website this week. In an update to its public AI principles page, the company erased a section titled ‚Äúapplications we will not pursue.‚Äù The company pointed TechCrunch to a blog post on ‚Äúresponsible AI,‚Äù which notes that Google should work together with governments and organizations ‚Äúto create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.‚Äù

### **Analysis**

**We‚Äôre experiencing the biggest breach of U.S. government data:** Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE has taken control of large swathes of Americans‚Äô private information held by the U.S. government despite questions about their security clearances, their cybersecurity practices, and the legality of Musk‚Äôs activities. As Zack Whittaker writes, whether DOGE staffers are bad actors misses part of the point. Acts of subterfuge, espionage, or ignorance could produce the same outcome: exposure or loss of the nation‚Äôs sensitive datasets.
