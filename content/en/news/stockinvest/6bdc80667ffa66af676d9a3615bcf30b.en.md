Semiconductor machinery giant [Applied Materials](https://stockinvest.us/stock/AMAT) (NASDAQ: AMAT) is poised to unveil its earnings report today after the market concludes its trading day. Traders will want to keep a keen eye on what unfolds.

[In the previous quarter](https://stockinvest.us/earnings-report/AMAT), Applied Materials exceeded analysts’ revenue projections by a modest 1.2%, racking up $7.05 billion in revenue—a 4.8% increase year over year. This impressive performance came alongside a notable upswing in earnings per share (EPS) as well as a commendable reduction in inventory levels. Clearly, the company is making strides.

As investors gear up for the upcoming earnings release, the pivotal question remains: Is Applied Materials a sound investment or one to sell? For the seasoned traders among us, more in-depth analysis is just a click away—feel free to explore our comprehensive offering.

Looking ahead, analysts have forecast a 6.5% year-on-year revenue growth for this quarter, expecting Applied Materials to hit $7.14 billion. This stands in contrast to the stagnation seen in the same period last year. Moreover, adjusted earnings are projected to come in at $2.30 per share. Over the past month, industry analysts have shown a consistent trend in reaffirming their estimates, indicating a collective belief that the company is set to maintain its trajectory as earnings approach. Historically, Applied Materials has demonstrated an ability to beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations, achieving an average beat of 2.5% over the past two years.

Diving a little deeper into the semiconductor manufacturing space, competitors have begun to roll out their quarterly results, providing hints about what might lie ahead for Applied Materials. For instance, FormFactor reported a robust year-on-year revenue increase of 12.7% that met expectations, while KLA Corporation posted an eye-popping 23.7% revenue jump, surpassing estimates by 4.5%. Despite these impressive results, FormFactor’s shares took a dive, declining 6.8%, whereas KLA Corporation’s stock remained relatively stable.

A broader look at the semiconductor sector reveals a generally cautious environment, with average share prices drooping by around 1.4% leading up to earnings. However, Applied Materials has bucked this trend, gaining 5.5% during the same time frame. Currently, the stock trades at $183.20, with analysts providing an average price target of $210.42—quite a promising upside for potential investors.
