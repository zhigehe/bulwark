Recent commentary from analysts at Citi has cast a shadow over the prospects of [Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)](https://stockinvest.us/stock/NFLX) investors, as they predict a lackluster performance for the streaming giant's stock through 2027. After witnessing a remarkable surge exceeding 90% during 2024, primarily fueled by impressive subscriber growth in Q4, Citi has now adopted a more cautious stance. They have maintained a Neutral rating on the stock, suggesting that the high-flying days might be over for the moment.

The analysts outlined a pivotal shift in focus for investors: moving away from the traditional metrics of subscriber growth and average revenue per member (ARM), which Netflix has chosen to scrap from its disclosures. Instead, revenue growth is expected to take center stage as the key performance indicator (KPI). Citi expressed skepticism regarding the lofty subscriber estimates circulating on Wall Street, hinting that these projections might be overly optimistic. On the other hand, they suggested that anticipated ad revenues might be too conservative.

Interestingly, the analysis pointed out that while U.S. price increases and foreign exchange benefits could drive growth, these factors have been considered moderate in the 2025 consensus forecasts. Citi's position is that Netflix will likely achieve revenue expectations, albeit through a different route than what the market anticipatesâ€”fewer subscribers but higher revenue per subscriber.

After recalibrating their numbers following Netflix's recent quarterly results, Citi adjusted its price target for the stock from $920 to $1,020, utilizing a multiple of 32 times the estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2026. However, this price upgrade came with a caveat: the firm does not foresee extraordinary returns for shareholders between 2025 and 2027 unless there are significant reductions in costs.

For traders watching [NFLX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/NFLX), this analysis serves as a wake-up call. While past performance may have been exhilarating, current expectations suggest a more tempered approach moving forward. Maintaining a keen eye on revenue trends rather than subscriber figures may become essential for making informed trading decisions in this evolving landscape.

So, if you've been riding the Netflix wave, it's perhaps time to adjust your strategy and consider what lies ahead with the streaming titan. With Citi's insights laying down a more cautious forecast, you might find yourself meditating on how to play your hand in this high-stakes market.
