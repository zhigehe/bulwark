The U.S. dollar recently hovered near a multi-week low, as traders responded to a positive Producer Price Index (PPI) report and fading tariff concerns. After the PPI data was released, the dollar didn’t soar but instead remained near its lowest point in almost three weeks.

Markets were relieved to learn that Washington’s plans for new tariffs on countries taxing U.S. goods will not take effect immediately. This delay is seen as a chance for possible negotiations, easing some market concerns.

Traders had expected tariffs could hurt the dollar, but the delay helped limit the damage. Meanwhile, the euro rose against the dollar, reaching levels not seen in over two weeks. This was partly driven by growing optimism around peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

As President Trump met with leaders of both countries, some traders hoped these talks could lead to progress. The euro was last seen at about $1.0454, while the British pound climbed to $1.2572, its highest since early January. These movements are important for traders, as they assess market changes.

Turning the PPI data, helped ease worries about U.S. inflation. While the report exceeded expectations, a closer look suggests that core PCE inflation—an important indicator for the Federal Reserve—might not be as concerning for January as previously thought. Futures traders are now pricing in a more cautious Fed, with expectations for interest rate cuts rising.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies like the euro, stayed mostly flat around 107.11 during trading, briefly dipping to 106.99. Investors are now waiting for upcoming retail sales data to understand consumer sentiment and spending, given these shifting economic signs.

Meanwhile, the yen gained some ground after rising to a recent high, showing resilience amid changing Treasury yields. For stock traders, this highlights the importance of staying alert to economic indicators and global events that can quickly impact the market.
