Adobe (NASDAQ:[**ADBE**](https://stockinvest.us/stock/ADBE)) is stepping up its challenge to OpenAI's Sora and Runway in the AI video market with its Firefly Video Model, tightly integrated into Premiere Pro. This tool is designed to deliver quick, high-quality production fixes, generating 5-second clips at 1080p—matching industry needs.

Pricing is competitive: users can create 20 clips for $9.99/month or 70 for $29.99, compared to OpenAI’s 50 lower-resolution clips for $20. A premium tier for studios is in development.

Adobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, emphasizes quality over length, focusing on motion, structure, and filmmaking authenticity—appealing to video professionals. For traders, ADBE’s performance will hinge on how well Firefly competes in this growing sector, where innovation is key to staying ahead.
