The Trump administration has recently taken a decisive step in international military relations, approving substantial arms sales to Israel, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion. This move seems to sidestep Congressional oversight, raising eyebrows and sparking debate among lawmakers. The latest package announced by the Department of Defense includes significant contributions from major contractors such as Boeing Co ([NYSE: BA](https://stockinvest.us/stock/BA)), which will handle the bulk of the $6.75 billion in munitions and associated guidance systems. Additionally, a noteworthy deal involving Lockheed Martin ([NYSE: LMT](https://stockinvest.us/stock/LMT)) for Hellfire Missiles is valued at around $660 million.

This announcement coincided with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where discussions included meetings with President Trump and Congressional members. Yet, tensions arose as Representative Gregory Meeks, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the administration for what he described as a breach of long-standing practices that typically allow Congress to review major arms sales. Meeks expressed his disappointment, stating that while he is supportive of Israel's military needs in the face of threats, the administrationâ€™s lack of engagement and transparency is concerning.

The controversy further deepened as Meeks emphasized that the U.S. operates as a democracy, not as a kingdom ruled by unilateral decisions, asserting the importance of Congressional respect and collaboration. Interestingly, this decision marks a significant departure from previous practices, as former President Biden's administration had attempted to keep members of Congress informed regarding arms proposals, illustrating a more conventional approach to defense sales.

President Trump, who commenced his second term earlier this year, appears to be reinforcing his allegiance to Netanyahu, openly supporting Israel's military actions against Hamas. As tensions escalate, particularly following the dramatic events that unfolded on October 7, 2023, where Hamas attacks resulted in considerable Israeli casualties, the stakes are high for the region and implications loom large for U.S. foreign policy.

Moreover, this isn't the first occasion where the Trump administration has exceeded traditional Congressional roles in defense matters. Previously, during his first term, Trump managed to bypass Congress by declaring a national emergency to facilitate a $8 billion weapons sale to Middle Eastern allies, which had left both sides of the aisle fuming.

As these developments unfold, traders should remain vigilant, recognizing that military and geopolitical shifts can significantly impact defense stocks such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. With defense budgets often under scrutiny and geopolitical tensions always in flux, these companies may offer both risk and opportunity in portfolios. So, as traders heed this news, they should consider the broader implications on global markets and their investment strategies moving forward.
