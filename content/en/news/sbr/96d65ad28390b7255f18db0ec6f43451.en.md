**Earnings per share stood at $0.0028.**

ISOTeam reported a 36.5% year-on-year (YoY) surge in net attributable profit to $1.9m in H1 2025 compared to $1.4m in the same period in 2024.

Earnings per share stood at $0.0028, rising by 7.7% YoY from $0.0026 a year ago.

Revenue for the period rose by 4.2% YoY to $65.4m, mainly attributable to the 61.6% YoY revenue increase in the A&A segment to $30.3m.

This increase partially offset the weaker revenue contribution from the R&R, C&P, and Others segments, which recorded YoY declines of 28.5%, 2.0%, and 12.3%, respectively.

Gross profit also rose by 18.4% YoY to $9.9m, with improved margins from projects secured post-pandemic.

Currently, [ISOTeam’s order book is valued at $188.7m](https://sbr.com.sg/building-engineering/news/isoteam-secures-25-new-contracts-worth-364m), with projects to be progressively completed until FY2029.
