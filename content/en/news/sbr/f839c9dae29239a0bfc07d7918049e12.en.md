Employees in Singapore are showing low trust in their leaders' ability to implement [AI](https://sbr.com.sg/information-technology/news/singapore-leads-ai-adoption-in-asia-report) effectively, Qualtrics said.

In its report, Qualtris found only 50% of managers and individual contributors believe their leaders are up to the task.

Additionally, just 47% think their bosses will prioritize employee well-being over profits when making AI-related decisions.

There is also a significant 17-percentage-point trust gap between senior leaders and lower-level employees regarding AI adoption.

On the other hand, while 67% of senior leaders believe AI is being introduced with clear ethical guidelines, only 48% of employees at the manager level or below agree.

A similar divide exists regarding AI’s impact on work, with 67% of senior directors having a positive outlook compared to just 46% of managers, creating a 21-point gap in sentiment.

When it comes to how employees expect to use AI-saved time, most workers in Singapore plan to focus on improving efficiency (57%) and increasing work quality (50%) rather than simply doing more work.

Only 26% of employees see AI as a way to increase their output. Interestingly, Singapore employees are more likely than their global counterparts to prioritize efficiency and quality over workload expansion.
