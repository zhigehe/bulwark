**Revenue also grew 1.8% YoY.**

Far East Hospitality Trust reported a 0.6% increase in net property income to $99.3m for the financial year ended 31 December 2024, despite rising property tax expenses.

The trust’s overall revenue grew by 1.8%, supported by stronger contributions from its REIT Commercial Premises segment and steady rental income from its hotels and serviced residences. This growth was achieved even as [Singapore’s visitor arrival](https://www.sbr.com.sg/hotels-tourism/news/singapores-visitor-arrivals-could-reach-185m-in-2025-report)s remained at 86% of pre-pandemic levels.

However, distribution to stapled securityholders saw a slight 0.6% year-on-year decline to $81.4m, largely due to increased finance costs and a shift in the proportion of the REIT Manager’s fee paid in Stapled Securities.

To offset rising expenses, the REIT Manager will distribute $5.1m as other gains and $3.0m to mitigate fee adjustments, in addition to the $8.0m annual capital distribution from the Central Square divestment.

Distribution per stapled security stands at 4.04 cents, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
