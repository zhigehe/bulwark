**Construction is scheduled to begin in March 2025.**

MRT Corporation (MRT Corp) and Sunway Integrated Properties Sdn Bhd signed a Master Agreement to jointly develop a $787.4m (RM2.6b) integrated mixed-use development [adjacent](https://sbr.com.sg/building-engineering/news/rail-system-installation-johor-bahru-singapore-link-begin-end-2024) to the Bukit Chagar RTS Link Station in Johor Bahru.

The project aims to provide connectivity to Singapore’s Woodlands North Station through the upcoming Rapid Transit System Link.

The 4.23-acre development will feature a multi-storey car park with 1,550 car bays and 1,015 motorbike bays, high-rise residential units, a retail mall, educational institutions, a health and wellness hub, and hospitality facilities.

Construction is scheduled to begin in March 2025, with the first phase – the multi-storey park & ride facility – expected to open to the public by 30 November 2026.
