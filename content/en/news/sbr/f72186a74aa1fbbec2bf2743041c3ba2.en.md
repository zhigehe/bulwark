[Frasers Property](https://The Orie, a joint residential development by Frasers Property, City Developments Limited and Sekisui House, is located in Toa Payoh, Singapore. This project is part of Frasers Property's strategy to increase development exposure over the medium to long-term. The highly-anticipated 777-unit development was 86% sold at launch, reflecting strong market confidence in the development capabilities of the joint developers and pent-up demand for new homes in Toa Payoh. ) also announced the redevelopment of Robertson Walk and Fraser Place Robertson Walk into a mixed-use lifestyle hub, holding a 51% stake, with the launch expected in 2025.

In industrial & logistics, projects totalling 343,000 sqm in Australia and Europe, 118,000 sqm in Thailand, and 158,000 sqm in Vietnam are set for completion in FY25 and FY26.
