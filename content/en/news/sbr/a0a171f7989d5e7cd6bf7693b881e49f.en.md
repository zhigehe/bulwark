**Singapore will continue to work on the range of mitigation measures available.**

Singapore has committed to reduce emissions to between 45-50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2035 as part of its 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

According to the government, 45 MtCO2e keeps the country on a linear path to its [net zero](https://sbr.com.sg/in-focus/seven-10-see-sustainability-key-future-survey) target in 2050, in line with international expectations.

The range takes into consideration the reality that as an alternative-energy-disadvantaged island state, Singapore depends heavily on developments in nascent mitigation technologies and international collaboration.

Singapore will continue to work on the range of mitigation measures available and explore other mitigation options as it has the potential to grow the green economy, create jobs, and generate new opportunities in a low-carbon world.

Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, will further elaborate on Singaporeâ€™s approach towards climate action and our 2035 NDC at the Committee of Supply Debate 2025.
