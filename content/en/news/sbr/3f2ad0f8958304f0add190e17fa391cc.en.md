**The new office space will house more than 100 local and regional teams.**

Amazon has opened its second corporate office in Singapore’s Central Business District at IOI Central Boulevard.

The new Amazon Web Services (AWS) Asia Pacific hub will facilitate growth in AWS's business, operations, and investments in Singapore and Southeast Asia.

Amazon will become IOI Central Boulevard’s anchor tenant, occupying over 360,000 sq ft of workspace which can accommodate up to 3,000 employees.

The new office space will span across eight floors, housing more than 100 teams, including local and regional employees supporting AWS and other corporate functions.

AWS is also set to invest an additional [$12b in its existing cloud infrastructure in Singapore](https://sbr.com.sg/information-technology/news/amazon-web-services-invests-12b-in-singapores-cloud-infrastructure) from 2024 to 2028.

“AWS’s new regional office in Singapore represents our deepening commitment to Singapore and serves as a strategic hub for digital transformation across ASEAN. Designed as a collaborative space, it connects AWS leaders with industry partners, enterprises, and innovators to advance technology development in Southeast Asia,” Jeff Johnson, managing director for ASEAN at AWS said.
