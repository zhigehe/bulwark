Across the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore tied with Hong Kong for second place in market optimism, trailing behind Australia, where 50.7% of professionals expressed a positive outlook.

“As the private capital landscape in the Asia Pacific continues to mature, we anticipate an ongoing shift towards more tailored compensation models that align with both global and regional market needs,” Shadi El Farr, regional managing partner of the Financial Services Practice for Asia Pacific and Middle East at Heidrick & Struggles said.
