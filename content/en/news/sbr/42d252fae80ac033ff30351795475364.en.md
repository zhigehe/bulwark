**Vita Partners is an integrated platform in Asia Pacific for the real estate market.**

[Lendlease](https://sbr.com.sg/commercial-property/news/lendlease-reits-portfolio-occupancy-rises-895-new-leases) and Warburg Pincus's life sciences and research and development (R&D) joint venture has unveiled its official name and brand identity as Vita Partners.

With over $2b of assets under management, Vita Partners is an integrated platform in Asia Pacific that develops, constructs, manages, and invests in life sciences, R&D, and innovation real estate.

Vita Partners, with a team of over 240 professionals, provides a full suite of real estate solutions, including state-of-the-art facilities and leased facilities under Vita’s management.

The platform, alongside its managed investment vehicle LINO, acquired a $1.6b portfolio of assets in Singapore in 2024, marking one of the largest private portfolio transactions for industrial assets in the country.

Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in January, Bart Price has been overseeing the platform’s strategic growth plans, supported by a team of real estate and investment specialists.
