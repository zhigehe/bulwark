**Profit for the period was $74.1m.**

[NetLink NBN](https://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/news/netlink-nbns-h1-profit-dips-83-yoy-485m-revenue-decline) Trust posted a profit of $74.1m for 9M 2025, down 12.9% year-on-year (YoY) from $85.1m a year ago.

Revenue for the period slipped 0.4% YoY to $308.2m from $309.4m in 9M 2024, primarily due to lower non-RAB revenue from a reduction in ancillary project revenue, partially offset by higher installation-related revenue.

In addition, EBITDA also slipped 5.1% YoY to $216.8m from $228.5m in 9M 2024 due to lower revenue and non-operating income, along with higher operating costs.
