**Earnings per share stood at $0.0588.**

[GuocoLand](https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/guocoland-bags-124b-green-facilities-dbs-and-ocbc) reported a 13% year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to $74.6m in H1 2025 from $66.2m a year ago.

This increase was due to the construction progress of the substantially sold development properties in Singapore and higher contributions from investment properties.

Earnings per share stood at $0.0588, up 15% YoY from $0.0513 in H1 2024.

On the flip side, revenue for the period slipped 5% YoY to $$1.01b partly due to the timing of progressive revenue recognition from the Property Development business in Singapore, as well as lower sales from China.

Meanwhile, gross profit grew 16% YoY to $247.9m and operating profit grew 35% YoY to $214.5m.
