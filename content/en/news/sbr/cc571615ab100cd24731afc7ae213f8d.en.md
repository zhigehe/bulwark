**The algorithm has been filed in over 150 member countries since August 2024.**

Alexandra Hospital’s [artificial intelligence algorithm](https://healthcareasiamagazine.com/healthcare/news/ai-based-clinical-trial-solutions-market-hit-24b-2030) for robotic total knee replacement (rTKR) has secured an international Patent Cooperation Treaty patent.

The algorithm has been filed in over 150 member countries since August 2024. Singapore’s patent was obtained earlier in October 2023.

The technology optimises personalised implant positioning in rTKR surgeries by integrating patient-specific anatomical characteristics with the surgeon’s preferred surgical philosophy.
