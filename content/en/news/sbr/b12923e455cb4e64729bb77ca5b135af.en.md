**The contracts involve maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) works.**

[ST Engineering](https://sbr.com.sg/building-engineering/news/st-engineering-secures-new-contracts-worth-43b-in-q4-2024)’s Commercial Aerospace business has secured maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) contracts for CFM56-7B and LEAP-1A engines with two major Middle Eastern operators.

The multi-year contracts will require ST Engineering to provide heavy maintenance services to the two operators from its engine MRO facilities in Asia.

ST Engineering’s Commercial Aerospace business added testing capabilities for the new-generation CFM LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines at its Singapore facility in 2024.

Currently, it is expanding its capabilities to include LEAP Performance Restoration Shop Visit services.

“Our market presence in the Middle East has been growing in recent years, and our latest contracts with the two new Middle Eastern customers provide a strong foundation for collaboration with operators in this region. We look forward to building strong partnerships with them and delivering high-quality services that fully meet their operational needs,” Tay Eng Guan, head of Engine Services at ST Engineering said.
