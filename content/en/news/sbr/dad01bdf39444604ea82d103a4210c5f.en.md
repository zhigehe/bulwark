**SEEK Pass enables job seekers to verify and share their work credentials.**

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) have partnered with Jobstreet by SEEK to launch the SEEK Pass to advance career health for professionals.

With SEEK Pass, candidates will be able to securely verify and share their work credentials to position job seekers and employers for success.

SEEK Pass will allow candidates to draw on their Careers & Skills Passport (CSP), which contains skills, employment history, education, and certification records from Government sources. The CSP was jointly rolled out by MOM and SSG in November 2024.

In addition, Jobstreet will partner with Accredify, to extend SEEK Pass capabilities by enabling the verification of educational qualifications from participating universities.

"With the surge in job applications in 2024, SEEK Pass addresses the need for efficient hiring processes and empowers candidates to stand out. Our collaboration with MOM, SSG, and Accredify ensures SEEK Pass is tailored to Singapore’s unique needs and complements innovations like Career Hub, our learning and community platform for career growth and upskilling,” Vic Sithasanan, managing director at Jobstreet by SEEK in Singapore said.
