**Gaw Capital holds 91% of the joint venture, with PCG owning 9%.**

Gaw Capital Partners has partnered with Patience Capital Group (PCG) to acquire Tokyu Plaza Ginza in [Japan](https://retailasia.com/exclusive/japans-beauty-industry-fights-online-fakes-blockchain), a prime retail asset in Tokyo's Ginza 5-chome district.

Gaw Capital holds 91% of the joint venture, with PCG owning 9%.

Completed in 2016, the property covers 15,153 tsubo (50,093 sqm) and is located near Ginza and Yurakucho Stations.

The asset, surrounded by luxury brand stores, department stores, and hotels, occupies a high-street footprint of over 1,139 tsubo with four-sided frontage.

Tokyoâ€™s strong retail sales, driven by luxury spending and tourism, continue to boost the property's value. The planned Tokyo Sky Corridor, a green pedestrian walkway opening in 2029, is expected to further enhance its potential.
