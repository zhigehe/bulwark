**The programme will connect unionized companies with approximately 1,200 mentors.**

The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has launched a new initiative to connect unionized companies with approximately 1,200 mentors and experienced industry leaders from its network.

The Company Mentorship Circle (CMC) pilot programme builds on the NTUC Executive Mentorship Programme, which has benefitted nearly 150 mentees over three pilot runs.

The next run scheduled to take place from March to May, will provide structured guidance to over 250 PME mentees.

“Many CEOs often tell me that they cannot get Singaporeans into their workplace. We hope that through this CMC scheme, our unionised companies can have a leg-up and attract graduates from our IHLs (Institutes of Higher Learning), be it from universities, polytechnics or ITEs,” Ng Chee Meng, NTUC secretary-general said.
