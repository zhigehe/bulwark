**The group’s ES Jewel vessel was in full operation during the year.**

ES Group Holdings Limited reported that it expects a net profit for the financial year 2024 (FY 2024), recovering from a net loss in FY 2023, based on the group’s preliminary data.

In its review of unaudited financial results, the company said the profit growth is attributed to a one-off other income from insurance claims for the breakdown of the group’s ES Jewel [vessel](https://sbr.com.sg/news/singapore-deploys-unmanned-surface-vessels-maritime-security).

During the period, ES Jewel was in full operation, and with the absence of the repair and maintenance expenses, the group’s shipping segment generated higher revenue and recorded a gross profit.

Additionally, the group’s new building and repair segment had an improved gross profit and its shipping segment recorded a gross profit over a gross loss for FY2023.
