**It has a combined strata area of 1,119 square feet.**

A pair of adjoining ground-floor retail units at Peninsula Plaza is up for sale for $10.9m, according to [Savills](https://sbr.com.sg/commercial-property/news/singapore-ranks-6th-in-savills-prime-office-costs-index-q42024).

The units are positioned on the ground floor offering a combined strata area of 1,119 square feet with a regular layout and prominent street frontage.

It is located within key destinations such as Funan, Raffles City, and CHIJME. It is also near Singapore Management University, The Capitol Kempinski Hotel, and Swissotel Stamford Singapore.

“The properties also provide a 3% yield to incoming investors which has become increasingly rare for prime ground floor retail units,” Nick Chan, associate director for investment sales and capital markets at Savills said.

Prospective purchasers are invited to submit their offers via a Private Treaty.
