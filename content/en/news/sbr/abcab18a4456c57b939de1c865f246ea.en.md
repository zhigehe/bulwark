**Revenue for the period reached $3.68m.**

[ThaiBev](https://sbr.com.sg/food-beverage/news/thaibevs-net-profit-slips-08-yoy-in-fy2024) reported a 2.4% year-on-year (YoY) increase in revenue to $3.68m (THB92.3m) in Q1 2025.

Revenue from its Beer and Non-alcoholic beverages (NAB) businesses registered a YoY growth of 8.0% to $1.4m (THB36.1m) and 7.2% to $678,394 (THB17m), respectively. This growth was due to an increase in total sales volume across all key markets.

Its Food business revenue grew 2.2% YoY to $227,461 (THB5.7m) due to new store openings, whilst its Spirits business revenue declined 4.8% YoY to $1.3m (THB32.2m) due to increased raw material costs and marketing spend.

ThaiBev’s Others business also dropped 6.6% YoY to $53473 (TBH1.34m) mainly due to lower licensing income and title rights.
