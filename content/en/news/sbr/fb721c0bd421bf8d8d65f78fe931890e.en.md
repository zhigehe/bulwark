**Nearly half of SMEs prioritise guaranteed returns (48%) and liquidity (45%), but traditional banking solutions fail to meet both needs.**

Singapore SMEs are losing $800m annually in potential interest by keeping idle cash in low-yield bank accounts, according to Syfe.

Despite facing financial pressures from rising costs and economic uncertainty, [Syfe](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-services/news/syfe-bids-55m-acquire-australias-selfwealth) noted many SMEs are not optimising their cash reserves, leaving significant value untapped.

Their recent survey shows nearly half of SMEs prioritise guaranteed returns (48%) and liquidity (45%), but traditional banking solutions often fail to meet both needs.

The survey also found that the average SME has less than 11 months of cash reserves, making them financially vulnerable to disruptions like rising interest rates and inflation.

In terms of cash management strategies, SMEs favor a diversified approach. Popular methods include money market funds (43%), standard business bank accounts (43%), and fixed deposits (41%). However, relying solely on these options can still leave significant financial value untapped.
