**This is attributed to lower revenue and higher selling and distribution expenses.**

[Japan Foods Holdings](https://sbr.com.sg/food-beverage/news/japan-foods-holding-anticipates-loss-q3-2025) recorded a net loss attributable to equity holders of the company of $2.9m in Q3 2025 over a net profit of $700,000 in Q3 2024.

Despite a higher number of operating outlets, revenue declined by 6% to $64.9m due to weak sales in November and December 2024. The group’s gross profit also decreased to $54.9m.

The company’s selling and distribution expenses also increased by 8.3% to $53.9m due to higher manpower costs, utilities expenses, and depreciation charges of right-of-use assets.

The company plans to rationalise its brand portfolio by focusing on its more established brands. In line with this, the group has decreased the number of operating outlets to 82 as of 31 December 2024.
