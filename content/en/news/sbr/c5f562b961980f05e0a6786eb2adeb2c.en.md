**Total distributable amount fell 4.1% YoY.**

[First REIT](https://sbr.com.sg/commercial-property/news/first-reits-net-property-income-drops-60-yoy-in-9m-2024) Trust’s distribution per unit (DPU) dropped 4.8% year-on-year (YoY) to $0.0236 in FY2024.

Total distributable amount fell 4.1% YoY to $49.3m from $51.4m in FY2023. In Q4 2024, the DPU remained unchanged at $0.058 from the previous quarter.

Rental and other income dropped 5.9% to $102.2m from $108.6m a year ago. Net property and other income also fell 6.5% YoY to $98.5m from $105.3m in FY2023.

The decline was mainly due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and Indonesian rupiah against the Singapore dollar, partially offset by higher rental income in local currency terms from Indonesia and Singapore properties.
