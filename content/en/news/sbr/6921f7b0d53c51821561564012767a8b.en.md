**It was driven by positive rental reversions.**

[Paragon Reit](https://sbr.com.sg/commercial-property/news/cuscaden-peak-take-paragon-reit-private) has reported a 4.5% increase in net property income to $224.7m for the full year ended 31 December 2024, up $9.6m from the previous year.

The rise in NPI was driven by positive rental reversions, though partially offset by higher finance costs.

The group’s revenue also grew 4.2% to $301.0m, while net income improved 3.3% to $142.1m.

Paragon REIT’s total return for FY2024 stood at s$314.9m, including a $175.6m fair value gain on investment properties, which does not impact distributable income.
