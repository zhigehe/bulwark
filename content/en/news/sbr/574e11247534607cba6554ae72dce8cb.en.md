**5,032 are Build-To-Order flats whilst 5,590 are Sale of Balance Flats.**

HDB has launched 10,622 flats for sale today, 5,032 of which are Build-To-Order (BTO) and 5,590 are Sale of Balance Flats (SBF), in February.

The BTO Flats are offered across 5 projects in Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown, Yishun, and Woodlands.

Eight out of 10 BTO flats have waiting times of four years or less. Amongst them, 1,531 flats at Chencharu Vines and Chencharu Green in Yishun will have even shorter waiting times of just over three years, at 37 and 38 months respectively. Flat buyers who are looking to move into their flats sooner can also consider applying for balance flats in the SBF exercise, where 4 in 10 flats are already completed.
