**The group's NPAT rose 47% YoY.**

[Hutchison Port Holdings Trust](https://sbr.com.sg/shipping-marine/news/hutchison-port-holdings-trusts-dpu-climbs-0077-in-2h23) (HPH Trust) posted a full-year distribution per unit (DPU) of 2.12 cents (12.20 HK cents) for 2024.

The second-half distribution was 1.25 cents (7.20 HK cents), up from 0.0087 cents .87 cents (5.00 HK cents) in the first half. The ex-distribution date is set for 17 February 2025, with payment scheduled for 28 March 2025.

HPH Trust’s net profit after tax (NPAT) rose 47% year-on-year to $378m (HKD2.17b). Revenue and other income for the year totaled $2.01b (HKD11,567.3m ), up $162.2 (HKD931.8m) (8.8%) compared to last year.

Combined container throughput at HPHT Kwai Tsing (HIT, COSCO-HIT, and ACT) decreased by 6.4%, mainly due to lower local and transshipment cargo volumes. In contrast, YICT’s container throughput increased by 12.4%, driven by higher laden exports, inbound empty containers, and transshipment cargoes.

Average revenue per TEU in Hong Kong remained flat, while in China, it was slightly higher, primarily due to increased storage income, partially offset by RMB depreciation.
