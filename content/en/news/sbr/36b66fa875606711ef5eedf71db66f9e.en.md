**The preview of ELTA will continue until 18 February 2025.**

MCL Land’s Clementi development, [ELTA](https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/elta-public-sales-launch-22-february), attracted about 4,500 prospective buyers during its first preview weekend last 7 to 9 February 2025.

“We expect strong investor interest, driven by rental demand from professionals and international students. In addition, the strong performance of past projects in Clementi suggests promising long-term value appreciation,” China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Chairman Qian Liang Zhong said.

ELTA features over 50 resort-style facilities spread across five distinct zones, including a 50-metre lap pool, gymnasium, tennis court, and dedicated areas for social gatherings.

Located near Clementi MRT station on the East-West Line and the future Cross Island Line, it offers easy access to established schools, shopping centres and green spaces.

The preview of ELTA will continue until 18 February 2025, with sales commencing on 22 February.
