“The overwhelming response to PARKTOWN Residence underscores the enduring appeal of Tampines as a vibrant regional centre offering a mix of business, retail, and lifestyle amenities,” a UOL-CLD JV spokesperson said.

“With its strategic location, excellent connectivity, and spacious, upscale homes, PARKTOWN Residence is poised to meet the evolving needs of modern homeowners. Given the strong interest we’ve seen, we anticipate that buyers – whether young professionals, families, or investors – will recognise the long-term value of securing a home in one of Singapore’s most sought-after townships,” the spokesperson added.
