**Revenue for the year went up 2%.**

NSL Ltd reported a profit attributable to equity holders of $21.3m for the period ending 31 December 2024, recovering from a loss of $18.7m from a year before.

The group said turnover in 2024 improved by 2% to $302.7m from $298.1m in 2023 mainly as a result of higher revenue from the Environmental Services division.

In the six months ending 31 December 2024, group turnover jumped 41% to $179.7m from $127.3m a year before due to strong revenue growth by the Precast (56%) and Environmental Services (11%) divisions.

NSL also reported an H2 net profit of $18.9m.
