**Its property value increased by 6.2% YoY to $26b following year-end valuations.**

DBS Group Research anticipates that [CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust](https://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/news/cicts-npi-13-yoy-in-h2-2024)’s (CICT) Singapore assets will remain stable, with potential growth from retail and office segments, driven by strong positive reversions.

CICT’s distributable income increased by 5.1% year-on-year (YoY) to $752.2m, whilst its distribution per unit (DPU) increased by 1.2% to 10.88 Scts, surpassing DBS’s estimates and in line with consensus estimates.

Reversions across all sub-asset classes remained robust and exceeded estimates, with office reversions increasing by 11% and retail reversions rising by 9%.

Occupancy costs within the retail portfolio improved to a post-pandemic high of 17%.

On a same-store basis, the increase would have been 1.4% YoY, led by Singapore and Germany assets.

The portfolio’s property value increased by 6.2% YoY to $26b following year-end valuations, including ION Orchard.
