Summary
-------

* Crypto markets continued to climb in January, despite a pullback in valuations on weekend tariff news. January also saw a flurry of activity that could have an impact on the digital asset industry for the rest of 2025 and beyond.
* The Trump administration issued a sweeping executive order on cryptocurrencies, promising to protect key principles of the market, including the right to self-custody of digital assets. The order also said the government would "promote the development and growth of stablecoins." On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued updated policy guidance allowing traditional financial institutions to custody crypto assets.
* In addition to policy news, a technological breakthrough by Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek has also put a spotlight on the need for decentralized artificial intelligence models and related infrastructure.

According to the Grayscale Crypto Index, which we developed in partnership with FTSE/Russell, the overall crypto market valuation rose by 7% in January 2025. The Grayscale Crypto Index is a market-cap-weighted measure of investable digital assets. Bitcoin’s price rose by 9% month-over-month, reaching a high of approximately $109,000 during the month and rising to [1] at the end of January. Crypto assets with a market cap lower than Bitcoin (often referred to as “altcoins”) rose by about 4% overall (Chart 1).

Most traditional asset classes also generally rose in January (Chart 2). **The gains in Bitcoin prices were in the middle of the range after risk adjustment (i.e., taking into account the volatility of each asset). The dollar depreciated and several non-US stock markets outperformed, which may be due to the Trump administration's signal that any tariff increases would likely be gradual - although these expectations ultimately proved wrong.** [2] In contrast, some large-cap tech stocks were held back by increased earnings uncertainty after Chinese startup DeepSeek announced a new breakthrough in artificial intelligence development. Gold has also performed well over the past month and has outperformed most other major assets on a risk-adjusted basis. [3]

After President Trump took office on January 20, the new administration immediately began to change U.S. policy toward blockchain technology and digital assets. The first specific policy change is the revocation of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which required financial institutions to treat custodial crypto assets as assets on their balance sheets, thereby preventing them from participating in this business. On January 23, the SEC under Acting Chairman Uyeda issued SAB 122, revoking the previous order. This change should allow existing securities custodians to also protect crypto assets in the United States.

On the same day, the White House issued an Executive Order (EO) on crypto policy entitled "Strengthening America's Leadership in Digital Financial Technologies". Grayscale Research believes that the most important feature of the EO is the support for the basic principles of the industry, including the right to access open networks, develop and deploy software, participate in mining and staking/validation, peer-to-peer trading, and self-custody of digital assets. It also emphasizes the need to protect individuals and businesses from accessing traditional banking services. The EO further lists a timetable for amending federal government regulations and establishes the President's Digital Asset Market Task Force, which will include the Secretary of the Treasury and other regulators.

The President’s executive order also states that it is the government’s policy to “promote the development and growth of legal and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins.” Stablecoins provide a way to transact in fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar using blockchain infrastructure. Today, the total value of stablecoins in circulation exceeds $200 billion (Figure 3). Given the explicit requirements in the executive order, stablecoins are perhaps the area where regulatory guidance has changed most rapidly. In the European Union, stablecoin policy is incorporated into the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into full effect late last year. Stablecoin USDC has reached a regulatory agreement with MiCA, while Tether (USDT) has not, which may be one reason for USDC’s recent market share growth. Tether said in January that it was developing a strategy for the European market[4] and announced that USDT would join the Bitcoin Lightning Network[5].

Finally, the executive order directs the working group to “evaluate the potential for establishing and maintaining a national digital asset reserve.” [6] Grayscale Research **expects the White House to follow through on this commitment, but we are unsure whether the federal government will raise taxes or borrow funds to purchase Bitcoin on the open market.** In addition, several U.S. states are moving forward with initiatives to establish Bitcoin reserves, with bitcoinist.com reporting that 14 states (e.g., Texas, Oklahoma) have legislative processes underway.

In addition to the executive order on crypto policy, President Trump and his family launched the memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA on the Solana blockchain. [7] Memecoins are digital assets that do not claim to provide real-world utility, but which can nonetheless have economic value to members of a community as a form of entertainment (like physical collectibles). Figure 4 shows the current most popular memecoins by “mindshare” (social media attention). Dogecoin is the dominant memecoin by mindshare and the largest memecoin by market cap. Figure 4: TRUMP is the fifth most popular memecoin Over the past year, the Solana blockchain has seen a surge in memecoin issuance activity. This activity has been driven primarily by pump.fun, an innovative platform where users can create and deploy their own memecoins. Over the past year, approximately 7 million new memecoins have been created on Solana, with new tokens on pump.fun being issued at a rate of approximately 60,000 per day (Figure 5). Memecoin transactions generate transaction fees, and therefore generate value for Solana token holders. Pump.fun itself (close to $150M in January 2025 alone). [8] Solana blockchain (hosting applications and activity beyond memecoin) As a result, Solana’s fee revenue is comparable to Ethereum’s fee revenue, while Solana’s (fully diluted) market cap is only 35% of Ethereum’s. [10] Over the past year, Ethereum has lagged behind Solana in terms of memecoin activity in January, likely in part due to higher transaction fees. Figure 5: Solana platform pump.fun issues about 60,000 memecoins per day on average From a cryptocurrency industry perspective, the best performing segment is the currency sector, and the worst performing are the consumer and cultural sectors (Chart 6). Our cryptocurrency industry index is weighted by the square root of each asset’s market cap to reduce the weight of the largest tokens and better represent the broader market. **The strong performance of the currency sector mirrored Bitcoin’s gains.** [11] The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a blockchain designed for fast and efficient digital payments. XRP is the native asset that powers XRPL and facilitates low-cost cross-border transactions. We attribute XRP’s price performance to several factors, including a clear shift in regulatory risk associated with a change in U.S. government. Additionally, XRPL developer Ripple said that its performance so far has been strong, with RLUSD growing to a market cap of over $500 million[12] and becoming the fourth most traded stablecoin on centralized exchanges over the past month. [13]

Just like traditional markets, the development of artificial intelligence technology was a dominant theme for the crypto asset class in January. Most importantly, on January 20, Chinese startup DeepSeek launched its new open source AI model R1,

At the same time, the DeepSeek news highlighted the risks associated with centralized AI development, such as data security, bias, and censorship - risks that can be addressed by blockchain-based AI platforms such as Bittensor. Bittensor is a decentralized network that aims to create an “Internet of AI” with interconnected ecosystems called “subnets,” each focused on a different, specific use case. Bittensor is planning a potentially major network upgrade in mid-February, called the Dynamic TAO (“dTAO”), which will make it possible to invest in individual subnets; we believe this could inject a new wave of liquidity into the Bittensor ecosystem. [16] Access to DeepSeek’s high-performance open-source models could also reduce costs and lower the barrier to entry for many open-source decentralized AI projects, especially at the application layer, such as AI agents. We are already seeing this happening. For example, decentralized AI agent launchpad ai16z (renamed ELIZAOS) allows agents built using its ELIZA framework to access DeepSeek’s models.

The digital asset industry is evolving rapidly—as evidenced by a flurry of news in January 2025. While there are many different developments, in general they point to increased regulatory clarity, growing institutional adoption, and continued technological advancement. **The new tariffs announced by the Trump administration in late January are likely to weigh on all markets in the near term, and cryptocurrency investors need to keep a close eye on these developments.** In addition to tariffs, Grayscale Research **expects crypto markets to focus on continued changes in the U.S. federal government’s regulatory guidance on stablecoins and other topics, as well as other macro issues, including the outlook for U.S. tax policy and the prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts.**
