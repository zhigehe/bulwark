The rare card, redeemable for one Bitcoin—valued at up to $108,786 in January—was part of Cardsmiths' 2024 Holiday Currency Set, which blends festive themes with cryptocurrency collectibles.

Alongside cards featuring the Gingerbread Man and Charles Dickens, the set offers crypto redemption cards, with odds of approximately 1 in 96 packs.

Cardsmiths owner Steve Loney in a statement:

> “This most recent discovery from our Currency Holiday 2024 Trading Card series just shows that any pack pull has the potential to become a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”

This lucky pull secured a full [Bitcoin](https://www.coinlive.com/news/trump-enters-investment-arena-eyes-bitcoin-plus-etf-launch-is ), while other redemption cards in the set include popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Not the First BTC Redemption Card Discovered
============================================

Although it stands as one of the largest prizes in the company’s history, this is not the first Bitcoin redemption card discovered in a Cardsmiths series.

Last year, a collector pulled a full Bitcoin redemption card from a $33 Cardsmiths pack purchased at GameStop, and another full Bitcoin card was found in March 2024 from a pack sold at a Texas GameStop.

Cardsmiths’ parent company, Tonyk, initially announced that five [Bitcoin](https://www.coinlive.com/news/bitcoin-gains-favour-among-us-parents-as-alternative-to-traditional ) redemption cards were produced in its first series.

While it remains unclear if that number includes future releases, at least three full Bitcoin cards have been publicly confirmed across multiple sets.

Currently, all Currency Series packs with crypto redemption cards are sold out on the Cardsmiths website, but the company plans to launch Currency Series 5 and SPACE: Galactic Edition later this year, each featuring new crypto redemption cards.
