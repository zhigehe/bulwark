Elon Musk Rules Out TikTok Buy
==============================

[Elon Musk](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-kicks-off-x-spaces-for-d-o-g-e-details-usaid ) has dismissed rumours of acquiring TikTok, stating unequivocally that he is not interested in buying the app.

In his first public comment on the speculation, made remotely at a German conference hosted by Axel Springer CEO Mathias Doepfner, Musk denies rumours of TikTok acquisition.

Elon said plainly in a video call:

> “I have not put in a bid for TikTok. I don’t have any plans for what I would do if I had TikTok. I literally don’t know.”

He does not even use [TikTok](https://www.coinlive.com/news/tiktok-s-us-battle-takes-a-new-turn-as-justin-sun ) for that matter.

He added:

> “I’m not champing at the bit to acquire TikTok.”

Reflecting on his past acquisition of [X (formerly known as Twitter),](https://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ) Musk explained that purchasing established companies is not his usual approach; he prefers building businesses from the ground up.

> Summary of Elon's take on TikTok:  
>   
> 1. Not planning to buy it  
> 2. It's not a productive app and not beneficial  
> 3. He doesn't use TikTok   
> 4. He doesn't acquire business for economical reasons [pic.twitter.com/MOMOaKzwBP](https://t.co/MOMOaKzwBP)

He added that his decision to acquire X in 2022 was driven by a commitment to safeguard free speech, a principle he has long championed.

China Names Elon Musk as Potential TikTok Buyer
===============================================

Despite Musk's disinterest in acquiring TikTok, Chinese officials have reportedly suggested him as a potential buyer for the app’s US operations.

According to a Bloomberg report from January, Musk’s ties to [President Donald Trump](https://www.coinlive.com/news/critics-slam-trump-for-calling-fatal-washington-crash-amazing-in ) may influence this speculation.

One possible scenario discussed is having Musk’s company, X, manage TikTok’s US division if ByteDance fails to prevent a permanent ban.

TikTok has long been a point of contention in US politics, with national security concerns over its Chinese ownership.

However, ByteDance has steadfastly resisted selling the app, prolonging the ongoing drama.

[President Trump](https://www.coinlive.com/news/president-elect-donald-trump-to-the-rescue-as-tiktok-restores-service ), who initially pushed for a TikTok ban during his first term, shifted his stance after TikTok proved instrumental in helping him connect with younger voters.

He later signed an executive order that temporarily blocked any forced sale or shutdown, providing ByteDance more time to negotiate.

ByteDance CEO Shou Chew was even seen at Trump’s inauguration, signalling potential behind-the-scenes cooperation.

However, the future of TikTok remains uncertain, with [Trump](https://www.coinlive.com/news/president-elect-donald-trump-to-the-rescue-as-tiktok-restores-service ) recently suggesting that Musk or Oracle’s Larry Ellison could step in to acquire the platform.

The situation is further complicated by the Chinese government’s control over any sale.

While US legal pressure mounts, including the potential for a Supreme Court ruling, Beijing retains the final say.

Although ByteDance currently has no intention of selling, that could change depending on future developments.
