Is CZ Launching a Meme Coin Inspired by His Dog?
================================================

[Changpeng Zhao (CZ),](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-returns-to-lead-ai-and-strategic-investments-reinvents-binance ) former Binance CEO, may be venturing into the meme coin space with a token inspired by his Belgian Malinois.

The idea surfaced after a social media exchange erupted into a frenzy, with users urging him to share his pet’s name and photo.

The conversation began when an [X (formerly known as Twitter)](https://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ) user expressed frustration over Bitcoin’s inability to surpass $100,000, posting a meme about its price struggle.

> 😂 I remember a similar sentiment when bitcoin crossed back and forth around $10,000 a few years back. 😂

CZ joined the discussion, mentioning his dog—notably clarifying that it is a Belgian Malinois, not the more popular Shiba Inu, a staple in [meme coin culture.](https://www.coinlive.com/news/kanye-west-rejects-meme-coin-rumours-warns-against-fan-exploitation ) 

> Yes, not a Shiba Inu, but a Belgian Malinois.

CZ Curious About How Meme Coins Work
====================================

An X user, Crypto Kemal, quickly demanded the name and photo of CZ’s Belgian Malinois, the typical starting point for creating a dog-themed meme coin.

> “Not a Shiba Inu” good enough 😂😂

CZ, seemingly surprised, asked his 9.6 million followers if sharing a name and photo was all it took to launch a [meme coin.](https://www.coinlive.com/news/central-african-republic-president-s-x-account-unveils-official-meme-coin ) 

His “newbie question” sparked curiosity, as he also wondered how the community would identify an official token amidst multiple imitators.

Just 30 minutes later, CZ returned with an update, fuelling speculation that he might actually be considering a meme coin launch.

> Got the answers now. Pretty interesting how things work. Will mull it over for a day or so, as usual for big decisions😂. Respect his privacy, or dox the dog for the cause? Oh well, might even interact with a couple of the memes on BNB Chain. 🤣

Traders swiftly took notice, preparing for the potential surge that any [CZ](https://www.coinlive.com/news/travala-ava-momentum-wanes-despite-record-rally-and-cz-s-faithful )-backed token could generate, given his legendary status in the crypto space.

> Nah, that would be lying. If we do it, we do it proper. It's just sharing a photo and name of a dog.

CZ Was Once a Meme Coin Sceptic
===============================

CZ has long expressed scepticism about [meme coins.](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-addicted-to-changing-names-briefly-becomes-harry-b-lz ) 

In November 2024, he called the trend “a little weird,” urging developers to prioritise real blockchain applications over hype-driven tokens.

> I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting "a little" weird now.  
>   
> Let's build real applications using blockchain.

Ironically, his own musings about a dog-themed meme coin have now become a meme within the crypto community.

Since 2023, meme coins—especially those on the Solana blockchain—have dominated the crypto market and the current bull cycle.

Binance even posted a tutorial on creating a meme coin on 9 February, though the demonstration token, TST, surged after traders sniped it.

CZ has also criticised Binance’s token listing process, noting its flaws and the short four-hour notice before listings go live.

CZ explained on [X](https://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ):

> “I am entirely NOT involved in their listing process. Based on historical experience, people always complain, ‘Why do you list this but not the coin I hold?’ You might not like to hear this, but the truth is: exchanges must compete to list popular coins (with trading volume) as early as possible. If your coin is actively sought after by traders, you don’t need to talk to exchanges. As I always say, work on your project, not the exchanges.”

He highlighted how regulatory pressure on utility tokens, often mislabelled as securities, has driven developers to meme coins.

According to [CZ](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-returns-to-lead-ai-and-strategic-investments-reinvents-binance ), while assets with clear value face less speculation, meme coins thrive on volatility.

Despite not trading them himself, he acknowledged their undeniable appeal in the crypto market for their unpredictability and speculative allure.

> Last lastly, as an observer, I think the Binance listing process is a bit broken. They announce, then list 4 hours later. The notice period is necessary, but in those 4 hours, the token prices go high on DEXes, and then people sell on CEX...  
>   
> Not sure if there is a solution for…

He clarified in a 11 February post:

> “Not being into something doesn’t mean I’m against it.”
