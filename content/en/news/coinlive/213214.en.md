CZ Unveils Pet Dog’s Identity & Story
=====================================

[Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ)](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-s-change-of-heart-on-meme-coins-hints-meme-coin ) has once again ignited the crypto community—not through market moves, but by revealing his dog’s name.

On Thursday, CZ unveiled that his 18-month-old Belgian Malinois is named Broccoli, triggering a frenzy among meme coin enthusiasts eager to create or invest in the next viral token.

This revelation came after a spirited exchange on [X (formerly known as Twitter),](ttps://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ) where CZ pondered sharing his pet’s name and photo as traders flooded his replies. h

> Will post the dog pic in 3 hours, 8PM ish Dubai time. 🦮🤣 <https://t.co/DkaCEDsjc3>

The anticipation spurred a surge in “[CZ’s Dog” tokens](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-s-change-of-heart-on-meme-coins-hints-meme-coin ) like CLEO, BROWNIE, and PERRY, which briefly reached multi-million dollar market caps on BNB Chain before plummeting once Broccoli’s identity was confirmed.

CZ shared that Broccoli, gifted by a friend who owns a Dubai zoo, was named for its “blocky” sound—a playful nod to blockchain.

He recounted the dog’s transformation from a timid, unsocialised pup to a strong and confident companion, underscoring the unexpected intersections of personal life and crypto mania.

> Broccoli's Story  
>   
> A year and a half ago, I casually chatted with a friend who owned a (real) zoo in Dubai. Curious, I asked what dog breed is adapted to the Dubai summer heat. I had no plans to get a dog.

> Later that evening, my doorbell rang, and a young Belgian Malinois showed… [pic.twitter.com/vSLiHiS4fC](https://t.co/vSLiHiS4fC)

CZ Tasked Community to Create Tokens for His Dog
================================================

CZ unveiled Broccoli’s identity as a social experiment, urging that any tokens inspired by his dog at least use its real image.

Several BROCCOLI tokens have since emerged, experiencing sharp price swings.

Despite his recent criticism of meme coins, [CZ](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-returns-to-lead-ai-and-strategic-investments-reinvents-binance ) remains an impartial observer with no financial stake, viewing the BROCCOLI frenzy as an unpredictable social experiment rather than a profit-driven endeavor.

Broccoli Tokens Spring Up After CZ Reveals Pet Dog’s Name
=========================================================

The official reveal of CZ’s dog, Broccoli, sparked a frenzy of meme coin creation, with dozens of Broccoli-themed tokens launched on BNB Chain’s popular platform, [Four.meme](https://four.meme/)—comparable to Solana’s Pump.fun.

Demand surged so high that Four.meme temporarily went offline, according to reports on X.

Amused by the rapid developments, [CZ](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-returns-to-lead-ai-and-strategic-investments-reinvents-binance ) acknowledged the wave of tokens, leaving their fate to the community while hinting he might engage with the most prominent ones on BNB Chain.

[One BROCCOLI token briefly reached a $400 million market cap](https://dexscreener.com/bsc/0xa5067360b13fc7a2685dc82dcd1bf2b4b8d7868b) before settling around $74 million.

In just two hours, it generated over $220 million in trading volume and created at least 11 wallets with $1 million in profits, [according to DEXScreener.](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9wkngcvmutpngqtmhnzqwvryd7gpffxukcakdxgtvskp) 

[Broccoli tokens also proliferated on other blockchains, including Solana](https://www.geckoterminal.com/ ), where the leading token now holds a $5 million market cap with over $56 million in volume.

While some tokens outpace others, CZ maintains there will be no “official” Broccoli coin from him.

> For those asking for a CA (contract address) from me, no, I am NOT issuing a meme coin. I am just posting a photo of my dog and his name, as some of your requested.  
>   
> I also took advice from this thread yesterday. Let the best meme coin in the community win. 🙏🙏🙏 <https://t.co/dTe1izCwJW>

However, adding momentum to the trend, the BNB Foundation is reportedly considering providing liquidity and incentives to the most successful Broc meme coins.

All in Good Fun or Hidden Agenda?
=================================

[CZ](https://www.coinlive.com/news/travala-ava-momentum-wanes-despite-record-rally-and-cz-s-faithful )’s latest move appears less critical of meme coins and more like a playful jab at the market’s volatility.

While his stance on meme coins seems unchanged, the BROCCOLI [tokens](https://www.coinlive.com/news/central-african-republic-president-s-x-account-unveils-official-meme-coin ) have become an entertaining phenomenon.

CZ hinted he may engage with the most successful projects, but whether this shifts his personal views remains uncertain—and its impact on the broader market is likely minimal.

Critics were quick to accuse CZ of acting selfishly and doing whatever it takes to stay relevant.

> So, memes are not purely community-driven? <https://t.co/JmVCBYVMYU>

In response, CZ defended himself without turning combative, acknowledging the harshness of the criticism while admitting his limited experience with [meme coins.](https://www.coinlive.com/news/cz-s-change-of-heart-on-meme-coins-hints-meme-coin ) 

> The words are a bit harsh, but that is an interesting take. Yes, I wanted to see more activity on BSC. And I did not want to get involved in issuing/running a meme coin, as I have zero experience. And I thought memes were community-driven. But feedback received. 🙏 <https://t.co/M83DZq9M2T>

He concluded that there are still lots to improve on.

> I didn't expect it to be a stress test. But interesting to see the breadth stress test (lots of new memes created), vs a depth stress test (one CA with lots of trading activity). I think everyone was preparing for the latter. Lots to improve on.😂 <https://t.co/qJYLhF0rII>

So is this merely harmless fun, or is there more beneath the surface?
