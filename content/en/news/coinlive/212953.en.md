Michael Saylor Signals New Bitcoin Purchase as Strategy Ramps Up Accumulation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Michael Saylor has hinted at another Bitcoin acquisition, marking the potential end of a brief pause in Strategy’s aggressive buying spree.

On Sunday, the company’s co-founder shared his customary Bitcoin chart on X, telling his 4.1 million followers:

> “Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots.”

The cryptic message suggests that Monday could see another major Bitcoin purchase, reinforcing Strategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

Strategy Holds Over 471,000 Bitcoin Worth $45 Billion
-----------------------------------------------------

The Virginia-based firm, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has amassed a staggering 471,107 BTC, currently valued at more than $45 billion.

Its last recorded purchase was on 27 January, when it acquired 10,107 BTC at an average price of $105,596 per coin.

In total, Strategy has invested approximately $30 billion in Bitcoin, securing an average entry point of $64,500 per coin.

Despite recent market fluctuations, this investment has generated around $15 billion in unrealised gains.

Bitcoin Dips as Market Faces Uncertainty
----------------------------------------

Bitcoin’s price briefly dipped below $95,000 on Monday morning before recovering above $96,200, according to CoinGecko.

The cryptocurrency is down 11% from its all-time high of $108,786 on 20 January, the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Although the post-inauguration period has seen positive regulatory developments, Trump’s newly imposed tariffs have unsettled markets, leading to a selloff in risk assets, including Bitcoin.

Investors remain cautious as trade tensions could add further volatility to the crypto space.

Strategy Rebrands and Doubles Down on Bitcoin
---------------------------------------------

On 6 February, [MicroStrategy officially rebranded to Strategy](https://www.coinlive.com/news/microstrategy-drops-the-micro-goes-all-in-on-bitcoin-with-strategy), a move that placed Bitcoin at the centre of its corporate identity.

The company introduced a new Bitcoin-themed visual aesthetic, including a logo change and updated branding colours.

CEO Phong Le reinforced the firm’s commitment to digital assets, stating:

> “Bitcoin and artificial intelligence are the two most transformative technologies of the twenty-first century. Our new name powerfully, and simply, conveys the universal and global appeal of our company.”

The name change coincided with Strategy’s Q4 2024 earnings report, revealing a revenue of $120.7 million—down 3% year-on-year—and a net loss of $640 million for the quarter.

However, the company continued to expand its Bitcoin reserves, adding 218,887 BTC worth $20.5 billion in Q4 alone, making it the firm’s most aggressive accumulation period to date.

Funding Strategy and Share Issuance Fuel Expansion
--------------------------------------------------

To finance its ongoing Bitcoin purchases, Strategy has leveraged various capital-raising methods.

On 7 August 2024, the company executed a 10-for-1 stock split for both Class A and Class B shares, reducing the cost of entry for investors.

By December, it had issued 42.3 million Class A shares, securing $15.1 billion in funding.

In early 2025, another 6.5 million Class A shares were issued, raising an additional $2.4 billion.

Despite these significant cash injections, Strategy still has $4.3 billion in available Class A shares for future offerings.

CFO Andrew Kang described the company’s capital plan as “firing on all cylinders,” confirming that $20 billion of the targeted $42 billion has already been raised.

Convertible Notes and Preferred Stock Expand Financing Options
--------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond traditional stock offerings, Strategy has tapped into convertible debt and preferred stock issuances.

In November 2024, the company raised $3 billion through 0% Convertible Senior Notes maturing in 2029, allowing investors to convert their holdings into Strategy stock at $672.40 per share.

After fees, the firm netted $2.97 billion from this issuance.

In January 2025, Strategy introduced Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock at $80 per share, raising $563.4 million after expenses.

These shares offer an 8% annual dividend and a $100 liquidation preference, providing the company with an additional funding stream.

Earlier, a separate convertible preferred stock offering brought in $584 million from institutional and retail investors.

Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Targets Long-Term Growth
------------------------------------------------------

Strategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy remains ambitious, with the firm executing its ’21/21 Plan’—a three-year roadmap to allocate $42 billion toward Bitcoin acquisitions.

So far, $20 billion has been deployed, largely through convertible notes and debt financing.

Despite the company’s Q4 loss and rising expenses, its Bitcoin holdings have yielded significant returns.

In 2024, Strategy reported a BTC Yield of 74.3%, but for 2025, it has set a more conservative target of 15%, suggesting a shift towards a more sustainable accumulation pace.

With Saylor once again signalling an imminent purchase, Strategy appears to be staying true to its core philosophy: accumulating Bitcoin, regardless of market fluctuations.

Whether the cryptocurrency market rallies or dips further, Strategy’s commitment to Bitcoin remains unwavering.
