**▌****Musk is on the cover of Time**

On February 8, Time Magazine featured Elon Musk as the cover character and published the article "Elon Musk's War on Washington". In the cover, Musk is wearing a suit and sitting behind a luxurious wooden desk that symbolizes power (or imitates the perseverance desk in the US President's Office). Behind him is the US flag on the left and the presidential flag on the right, suggesting that Musk is deeply bound to presidential power and American politics. According to the article: On one side is an agency with a 64-year history, a budget of $35 billion, and its mission is clearly defined by federal law; on the other side is Musk's political destruction team to dismantle the federal bureaucracy. They call themselves members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a group of temporary staff with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authorization.
Their power comes from Musk, the richest man on the planet, who has been given the task of dismantling most of the structure of the federal bureaucracy - cutting budgets, weakening the civil service system, and depriving independent agencies of the ability to hinder the president's goals.

**▌****Arweave computing platform AO mainnet is online**

After a year of testnet phase, the decentralized storage project Arweave officially launched the mainnet version of its computing platform AO. The native tokens previously minted and distributed to AR holders and testnet depositors will be transferable after the mainnet launch.
The launch of the AO mainnet is accompanied by the final release of its native token, which is separate from Arweave's AR token. The maximum supply of AO tokens is capped at 21 million, echoing the model of Bitcoin. The AO team said it adopted a fair issuance distribution model to distribute tokens to users who bridge assets to the platform and existing AR token holders. Based on holdings, 36% will be distributed to AR holders over time. The remaining 64% is reserved for economic growth incentives, especially for bridging assets into AO, including rewards for users who deposit assets such as DAI and stETH into the AO ecosystem. Before the launch, more than $700 million was pre-bridged to the AO testnet.
