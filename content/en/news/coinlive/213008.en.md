In 2024, Pudgy Penguins has been at the forefront of innovation, distributing multiple token airdrops in partnership with blockchain ecosystems such as zkSync, Omni Network, and Dymension. Together, these airdrops have generated significant returns for holders, demonstrating the potential of NFTs as a channel for financial growth.

What is the largest airdrop received by Pudgy Penguins holders?
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Pengu Airdrop

In December 2024, Pudgy Penguins launched its native token, PENGU, marking a major milestone in the development of its ecosystem. PENGU was initially launched at $0.05 per token and peaked at $0.07. This means that at the peak valuation, the PENGU value of each Pudgy Penguins NFT was $116,365, with 1.7 million PENGU allocated per Pudgy Penguin NFT. The PENGU airdrop accounts for 86.3% of the total value of airdrops received by Pudgy Penguins NFTs.

The airdrop was not limited to Pudgy Penguins NFT holders, but also included communities within the Pudgy Penguin ecosystem, such as Lil Pudgys and Pudgy Rods, as well as other NFT communities such as Doodles, Cool Cats, Deadfellaz, and Moonbirds. A portion of the tokens were also allocated to users participating in the ETH or SOL ecosystem, defined as “OGs” to reward early users of these blockchains. This broad distribution demonstrates a strategic effort to connect NFT communities and early cryptocurrency users with the Pudgy ecosystem. 

### Dymension Airdrop

During the Dymension airdrop in early 2024, Pudgy Penguins holders were rewarded with DYM tokens, which coincides with Dymension’s broader plan to integrate the NFT community into the Cosmos ecosystem. As part of the Cosmos ecosystem, Dymension is focused on enabling modular rollapp chains that provide flexibility to blockchain developers. At the time of distribution, the tokens were valued at $4.89 each. Each Pudgy Penguin NFT is worth 1,313 DYM, which is worth a total of $11,160 at the token's all-time high of $8.50.

### Omni Network Airdrop

Omni Network airdropped OMNI tokens to Pudgy Penguins holders as part of their efforts to increase awareness and adoption of cross-chain technology. Omni Network aims to promote interoperability between various blockchain ecosystems with the goal of creating a seamless user experience. Although the token price has dropped significantly over the course of a year, the initial airdrop provided a valuable introduction to Omni's ecosystem. At the time of the airdrop, OMNI tokens were valued at $27.06 each. OMNI's all-time high price is $53.81, and each Pudgy Penguin NFT is allocated 37 OMNI tokens, and holding one Pudgy Penguin can get a total of $1,984 worth of OMNI at the peak.

### zkSync Airdrop

As a key player in Ethereum's layer 2 solution, zkSync rewards Pudgy Penguins holders with ZK tokens in June 2024. zkSync's rollup technology emphasizes scalability and reduced transaction costs, making it a key player in Ethereum's future. ZK tokens reached an all-time high of $0.32 per token. At this price, each Pudgy Penguin NFT is allocated 8,721 ZK tokens, and a Pudgy Penguin holder received $2,799 worth of ZK tokens during the airdrop, bringing rich returns to each holder.

### LayerZero Airdrop

LayerZero’s July 2024 airdrop was another perfect airdrop for Pudgy Penguin holders. As a protocol that enables full-chain interoperability, LayerZero aligns with Pudgy Penguins’ ethos of connecting ecosystems and enhancing accessibility within the NFT community. By December 2024, the token value rose to $5.09, nearly doubling the gains for Pudgy Penguin holders, who received a total of 100 ZRO tokens for each Pudgy Penguin NFT held.
