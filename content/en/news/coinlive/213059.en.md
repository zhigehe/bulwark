Musk’s Brief Name Change to Harry Bōlz…Again
============================================

[Elon Musk, owner of X,](https://www.coinlive.com/news/money-talks-elon-musk-s-97-4b-openai-takeover-attempt-met-with ) briefly changed his account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, sparking a sudden surge in two Solana-based meme coins bearing the same name.

Musk offered no explanation for the name change, though it is not the first time he’s adopted the moniker.

In April 2023, he similarly rebranded himself as Harry Bōlz, claiming it was a ploy to get media outlets to refer to him by the name.

> Tbh, I’m just hoping a media org that takes itself way too seriously writes a story about Harry Bōlz …

At the time, speculation swirled about whether the move hinted at an upcoming project, while others dismissed it as [Musk](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-kicks-off-x-spaces-for-d-o-g-e-details-usaid )’s characteristic wordplay and trolling.

This latest name change may be linked to Edward Coristine, a Musk protégé nicknamed “Big Balls.”

Coristine has held advisory roles at the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, though his appointment has raised eyebrows.

A former Neuralink employee and current [Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-kicks-off-x-spaces-for-d-o-g-e-details-usaid ) affiliate, the 19-year-old was previously fired from an internship for allegedly leaking internal information to competitors.

His new government roles involve handling sensitive data, leading one unnamed US official to label his appointment as “dangerous.”

Despite the controversy, Musk continues to support Coristine, with some speculating that the Harry Bōlz alias was a show of solidarity.

Is Musk’s Just Trolling Everyone with Pointless Name Change?
============================================================

[Musk](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-dismisses-tiktok-acquisition-possibility-despite-support-from-chinese ) appeared to relish the reaction to his brief name change on Tuesday, particularly when CNN anchor Dana Bash inadvertently read the suggestive alias on-air.

Bash said reluctantly as she looked at the camera:

> “Disruptor-in-chief, Elon Musk, who apparently has adopted the alias - at least he changed his social media handle to Harry Bōlz - tweeted this morning "Democracy in America is being destroyed by judicial coup. An activist judge is not a real judge".'

The stunt came in response to a series of legal challenges and judicial rulings aimed at halting executive orders tied to former President Donald Trump, which Musk claimed were impeding his initiatives under [D.O.G.E.](https://www.coinlive.com/news/department-of-government-efficiency-flooded-with-relentless-lawsuits-will-solo ) 

The Tesla CEO later retweeted the clip, mocking the network with the caption, "Made them say my name," punctuated by laughing emojis. Musk, 53, has since reverted to his original account name.

> Made them say my name 🤣🤣

Majority of Community Found Musk’s Name Change Hilarious
========================================================

Many praised Musk for his move, finding it hilarious.

Someone wrote:

> “Winning at every level!”

Another said that the name change 'could be the most rewarding accomplishment of D.O.G.E.'

Yet another commented with regard to Bash:

> “She actually said it. You can see the defeated look on her face LOL.”

Harry Bolz-Related Solana Meme Coins Sent Flying with Musk’s Name Change
========================================================================

[Musk](https://www.coinlive.com/news/money-talks-elon-musk-s-97-4b-openai-takeover-attempt-met-with )'s brief name change triggered a dramatic surge in two Solana-based meme coins.

The first, [Harry Bolz (HARRYBOLZ),](https://dexscreener.com/solana/6j4rsugoq9jzuubtbdagt9rbcb8yq1foay44hqmtbfwn ) launched on 7 February amidst speculation that Musk might adopt the moniker.

Following his name change on Tuesday, the token skyrocketed by an astonishing 54,637%, jumping from a $45,900 market cap to $25.14 million in just one hour, before correcting to $8.5 million.

Early investors reaped significant rewards—[one trader who invested $1,900](https://solscan.io/account/DMqibTACAF4piJjA92Kuim7pxzuNGFizmuZ5KTtttnx8 ) at launch cashed out with $343,800, while another turned [a $156 stake into $52,000.](https://solscan.io/account/BLospTp7vGtCVW5yz1hAKu4hapE71DZFbBybXP97449u )

A second token, also named Harry Bōlz (HARRYBOLZ), entered the market shortly after and quickly reached a $3 million market cap. https://dexscreener.com/solana/6n1x3lupcxdcyrjq2ftkb6tiqinojecffgcqqh45gmpk

However, its shorter lifespan and more modest growth led to fewer substantial gains, with the top trader earning $6,179 from a $14,400 investment.

Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted the activity of the notorious “LeBron” wallet, known for profiting $8.9 million [from $MELANIA](https://www.coinlive.com/news/ivanka-trump-decries-unapproved-meme-coin-ivanka-bearing-her-name ) and $3.2 million from $TRUMP tokens.

Just four days before Musk's stunt, the wallet purchased 128.8 million HARRYBOLZ tokens for 25 SOL (about $4,807).

After the price surge, the trader sold 109.8 million tokens for 3,649 SOL (approximately $737,000) and retained 18.97 million tokens valued at $277,000—netting a total profit of $1 million.

The volatility was just as swift as the ascent.

Within minutes of its launch, the meme coin surged 500%, eventually climbing 17,994% to reach a $3.68 million market cap.

But, as is typical in the meme coin market, the gains were fleeting.

Prices plummeted 99% from their peak, underscoring the fragility of tokens driven by celebrity influence and speculative hype.

Musk’s Love for Changing His Name
=================================

Musk's name changes on X have repeatedly ignited meme coin frenzies, sending tokens soaring before crashing just as quickly.

In January 2023, Musk briefly adopted the names Mr. Tweet and Naughtius Maximus before returning to his original handle, each shift sparking speculative trading.

More recently, [Musk changed his name to Kekius Maximus](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-changes-his-name-on-twitter-to-kekius-memecoin ), a nod to his Path of Exile video game character.

This move triggered a dramatic rally in the Ethereum-based [meme coin Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS),](https://www.coinlive.com/news/elon-musk-changes-his-name-on-twitter-to-kekius-memecoin ) which surged over 3,000%—jumping from a $12.7 million market cap to nearly $400 million within 30 hours.

However, the rally collapsed just as quickly when Musk reverted his name, causing KEKIUS to plunge 83% in a mere 10 hours.

These market disruptions raise a compelling question: Are Musk's name changes just harmless pranks, or is there a deeper strategy behind these market-shifting antics?
