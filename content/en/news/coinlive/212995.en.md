**$HTX** **performed well, HTX DAO handed in an annual report card**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2024, HTX DAO handed in an impressive annual report card, and it continued to exert its strength in decentralized governance, user growth and market expansion, and achieved remarkable results: the total number of people who subscribed for $HTX reached 391,221, and the cumulative subscription amount was equivalent to US$4.308 billion. As of January 22, 2025, the number of users holding positions exceeded 728,900, and the ecological scale continued to grow.

Looking back at 2024, the market performance of $HTX is undoubtedly phenomenal. Since hitting the bottom of $0.0000008 in early August 2024, $HTX has been climbing all the way, reaching a maximum of $0.000003596, an increase of 350%, setting a record high. At present, the price of $HTX is stable at around $0.0000023, with an average increase of nearly 3 times.

All this is not accidental. In 2024, a total of 49 trillion $HTX were destroyed, effectively promoting the balance of market supply and demand and supporting the growth of coin prices; the innovative launch of one coin for multiple mining, the rich $HTX prize pool, stimulated users' enthusiasm for holding coins. With the advancement of the $HTX destruction plan in January 2025 and the launch of more high-quality projects, $HTX may once again trigger a new round of market craze.

**Decentralized governance creates core competitiveness: everyone is a builder**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users are the masters of the ecosystem. As a decentralized autonomous organization, HTX DAO has used a diversified governance mechanism in the past year to give every community member the opportunity to participate in ecological construction and project decision-making. In the two elections of governance committee members held in 2024, a total of 11 community governance committee members were elected, all of whom were elected by community coin holders to achieve the goal of community autonomy.

Not only that, through the community governance proposal of HTX DAO, Huobi HTX promoted a number of innovative initiatives in 2024, including:

● Rocket Value voting mechanism for listing: Comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation of user holdings, transaction contribution, etc., so that users with higher Rocket Values ​​enjoy higher weight in proposals and listing decisions. The higher the Rocket Value, the greater the voting influence. This mechanism gives users practical decision-making power and promotes the healthy development of the platform ecology.   


● Community red envelope function: Project parties can distribute benefits in the community in the form of "red envelopes", and users can win token rewards by holding positions or participating in activities. Red envelopes not only add fun, but also allow users to enjoy the surprise experience of real-time interaction.

●  **Launchpool****One coin for multiple mining, empowering new gameplay:**"One coin for multiple mining" is another innovative proposal under the governance of HTX DAO. It connects coin earning and mining, supports users to obtain dual benefits of coin earning products and airdrops at the same time, and the user experience is more intelligent and friendly. In 2024, in the Launchpool event, the highest annualized rate of return reached 100%, and a total of 5.19 million US dollars in prize pool rewards were issued to HTX holders, creating rich returns for users. Launchpool has become an extremely attractive investment method in the market.

From proposal governance to coin listing decisions, from community red envelopes to consensus cohesion, HTX DAO is continuously strengthening the unique advantages of decentralized autonomy, allowing users and the ecosystem to grow together and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results.

**Looking forward to 2025: Towards the People's Exchange 2.0, building a decentralized future**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2025, HTX DAO will continue to focus on promoting token destruction, improving governance mechanisms, and expanding the layout of exchanges. It will launch more high-quality projects, explore new cooperation models, further strengthen community autonomy, strive to move towards the new paradigm of the People's Exchange 2.0, build a metaverse financial free port, and strive to achieve financial freedom for 8 billion people around the world.   


**Layout of the global market, more exchanges are about to be launched:** In 2025, $HTX plans to launch more exchanges and further expand its global market footprint. In 2024, $HTX was launched on 28 cryptocurrency exchanges, and the market performance was strong after the launch. According to the governance plan of HTX DAO, 50% of the Huobi HTX platform revenue will be used to repurchase and destroy $HTX, thereby increasing the scarcity of tokens and promoting long-term value growth.

**User co-governance, pushing decentralized governance to a new level:**HTX DAO encourages all community members to participate in platform proposals and put forward innovative suggestions for cross-project cooperation and ecological improvement. All proposals will be decided by coin holders through voting, ensuring that every $HTX holder can grasp the future direction of the project. This model not only strengthens the connotation of decentralized governance, but also provides an innovative demonstration for the entire blockchain industry.

As stated in the HTX DAO white paper: "The 'X' in the name $HTX symbolizes adaptability, inclusiveness and the potential for exponential growth." In this world where change is the only constant, HTX DAO will continue to break through existing boundaries, embrace every evolution of blockchain, and become the most dynamic decentralized community in the world. It will provide fertile ground for the most talented people in the blockchain field to work together and thrive, and jointly shape the future of decentralized governance.

In the new year, HTX DAO invites all participants to put forward more innovative proposals, explore new project cooperation, and jointly promote the prosperity and development of the DAO ecosystem. Currently, the anniversary celebration of HTX DAO is in progress. Huobi HTX and HTX DAO launched the "10 Billion $HTX Airdrop Carnival" event from 18:00 on February 7 to 18:00 on February 14 (UTC+8), especially giving back to users who have long supported and accompanied HTX DAO. Both new and old users can participate in the division of multiple gifts, and the total prize pool exceeds 10 billion $HTX. Thank you for your companions, and witness more possibilities in 2025!
