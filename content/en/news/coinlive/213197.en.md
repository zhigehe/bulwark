Headlines

**US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: Meme coins may not be regulated by the SEC**

In an interview with Bloomberg, Hester Peirce, a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that many Meme tokens may not fall under the SEC's regulatory scope because current regulations do not clearly classify them as securities. She pointed out that if Congress or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) wants to intervene, it will be their decision. Peirce believes that Meme tokens have no intrinsic value and are more like digital versions of Beanie Babies or baseball cards. She said: "If people are willing to buy tokens that lack long-term value, they are free to choose, but they should not be surprised by the price crash."

MEME Hotspots

Golden Finance reported that according to official news, Upbit will launch TRUMP won, BTC and USDT trading pairs. It is expected to open for trading at 18:00 local time on February 13.


**2.WLFI co-founder Witkoff X account hacked to promote fake projects**

Golden Finance reported that the X account of Zach Witkoff, co-founder of the Trump family-related crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), was hacked on Wednesday.
According to social media posts, the hacker promoted the memecoin project related to President Donald Trump's youngest son Barron Trump and claimed that "Trump should confirm the news soon." However, World Liberty Financial confirmed that Witkoff's account had been stolen.
World Liberty Financial said it was resolving the issue as soon as possible and urged users not to participate in fake projects.

DeFi hot spots
--------------

**1. Matter Labs co-founder: ZKsync governance will explore value accumulation mechanism**

Golden Finance reported that Matter Labs co-founder and CEO Alex Gluchowski said he expects the ZKsync community to begin discussing the optimization of ZKsync tokens in the near future and will add more features, such as value accumulation mechanisms, and the interoperability between ZK-based blockchain networks opens up a new dimension for its implementation.


**2.Vitalik: Railgun privacy pool mechanism can filter illegal funds without monitoring or backdoors**

On February 13, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin posted on social media that the Railgun privacy pool mechanism allows Railgun to avoid handling criminal proceeds without any monitoring or backdoors. Here's how it works:
路 Anyone can make a deposit to Railgun.
路 After the deposit, there will be a 1-hour detection period during which various algorithms will analyze whether the deposit may come from the criminal activity it determines.
路 If the deposit passes the screening, the user can use zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to make private withdrawals after 1 hour (but it is recommended to wait longer to obtain a sufficient anonymity set).
路 If the deposit fails the screening, the user can only withdraw the funds back to their own address. Doing so will not result in the funds being frozen or confiscated, but will not be able to enjoy the anonymity function of the privacy pool. If someone disagrees with Railgun's screening rules, they are free to fork and create their own privacy pool, but if they cannot gain wide enough public support, their anonymity will be very limited.
