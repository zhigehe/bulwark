Recently, Newton DAO has officially rebranded as AB DAO, marking a new era of decentralized autonomous governance. This is not just a brand upgrade but a major transformation in the projectâ€™s governance structure.  


AB DAO is composed of all $AB (formerly $NEW) token holders, with all decisions made through community voting, completely eliminating the traditional centralized management model. This transition strengthens decentralized governance, empowers the community as the leading force, and lays a solid foundation for the long-term development of the AB ecosystem.

### **Four Key Benefits of AB DAO: Governance Upgrade | Infrastructure Reform | Token Potential Growth | Enhanced Liquidity**

**Decentralized Governance Upgrade â€“ Stronger Community Authority**  
The decentralized governance model of Newton DAO has already been validated by the market. With this upgrade to AB DAO, community consensus is further solidified, ensuring that all token holders can genuinely participate in decision-making. The DAO mechanism will guarantee the long-term stability of the AB ecosystem, enhance community autonomy, and mitigate the drawbacks of traditional centralized management.  


**New Strategic Direction: Heterogeneous Blockchain Infrastructure + Web3 Application Ecosystem**  
AB DAO is no longer limited to community-driven economics but is now committed to building heterogeneous blockchain and asset infrastructure, integrating the latest Web3 technologies to provide foundational support for decentralized ecosystems. This transformation not only expands AB DAOâ€™s market potential but also creates new development opportunities for developers and users.

 **Unlocking Token Value Potential â€“ Market Expansion on the Horizon**  
 With the establishment of AB DAO, the market recognition of $AB tokens is expected to rise significantly. Community-driven governance, support for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and the construction of heterogeneous blockchain infrastructure will position the AB ecosystem as a leading Web3 project with long-term sustainability. This, in turn, boosts investor confidence in $AB and the AB ecosystem.

 **Exchange Expansion â€“ Strengthening Liquidity**  
 The original Newton project team has confirmed that AB DAO will accelerate token listings on multiple exchanges, further enhancing market liquidity. A broader range of trading channels means AB DAO will gain greater market visibility and provide stronger liquidity support for $AB (formerly $NEW).

### **Strong Community Response: AB DAO Officially Sets Sail, Ushering in a New Era for the Web3 Ecosystem**

Newton DAOâ€™s decentralized governance model has been a hot topic within the community, and the establishment of AB DAO has further ignited enthusiasm among members. Many early supporters have expressed strong confidence in ABâ€™s future.
