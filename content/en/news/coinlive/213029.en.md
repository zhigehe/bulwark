**On February 18, HTX, MEXC, and 4E exchanges will officially execute the ticker change for the AB project, renaming the NEW token to AB. This change requires no action from users, as the exchanges will automatically update the token name while maintaining the same balance.**

**Simultaneously, NewPay will undergo an upgrade, requiring users to simply update the app to view the AB token information. This brand update will not affect user assets, and key ecosystem projects such as NewSwap, Custom Mining, NewMall, Andverse, and NewBridge will continue operating normally. The token address format and total supply will remain unchanged.**

**For users who have staked NEW in NewPay, their assets will not be affected. However, NewForce staking mining has ended, and users are advised to unstake their assets at their earliest convenience.**

**⚠️ Important Notice: This is a brand upgrade only and does not require any token swap. Please beware of any fraudulent claims regarding token replacements.**
