After experiencing the most tragic Spring Festival in history, the crypto market seems a bit cold.

The Chinese people celebrated the Spring Festival nationwide, but behind it was a mess in crypto. It was thought that after Trump officially took office, the bright future of crypto was just around the corner, but on February 3, the crypto industry and even the global market ushered in a blow from the new president.

Against the backdrop of a new round of tariff wars in the United States, the global financial market has experienced a roller coaster ride. On the day of the news, all three major U.S. stock indexes closed down, and the Asia-Pacific market was significantly impacted. The South Korean stock market plummeted by more than 2.8%, the Japanese stock market fell by 2.48%, and the Hong Kong stock market fell by 1.9%. Although due to the subsequent softening of Mexico and Canada, on February 3, the tariff policy was announced to be postponed for one month, which eased the panic in the financial market, the crypto market was hit hard in uncertainty.

BTC prices once plummeted, hitting a low of $91,100, with a daily decline of about 7%. Ethereum once plummeted 25%, hitting a low of $2,080.19, reaching its lowest level in nearly a year. The top 200 tokens by market value generally fell, and epic liquidations occurred. More than 720,000 people were liquidated on that day. According to industry insiders, about $8-10 billion were actually liquidated.

This incident seems to have become a watershed. Although there have been frequent positive news and mainstream currencies have also warmed up, market sentiment still shows a high degree of fragility, and the fluctuations in currency prices have become more intense. The cottage sector has performed poorly, and even the previously strong AI sector has fallen into silence due to the emergence of Deepseek.

Has the bull market ended? This issue has gradually fermented in the market discussion.

**In fact, in the context of the crypto market's high reliance on incremental liquidity, the main game points in the current market are nothing more than the two major directions of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and Trump's crypto policy.** 

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy points to global liquidity. The importance of this indicator can be seen from the fact that Powell's hawkish policy caused a market crash in December last year. Because of this, the world is showing unprecedented attention to US inflation.

In the early morning of January 30, Beijing time, the Federal Reserve suspended the momentum of three consecutive interest rate cuts and maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.5%, which was in line with market expectations. Compared with the December 2024 interest rate statement, this statement deleted the statement that "labor market conditions have gradually eased (eased)", but emphasized that the unemployment rate remained at a low level. At the same time, the statement that "the inflation rate has made progress toward the 2% target set by the committee" was deleted.

On February 9, which followed, the non-farm report released by the U.S. Department of Labor showed that the U.S. unemployment rate was 4% in January, with 143,000 new jobs. According to Kugler, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, this data shows that "the labor market is healthy, neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating."

The market was very moved by the news, and even the previously unnoticed data from the University of Michigan had a direct impact on prices. A survey released by the University of Michigan showed that consumers' expectations for inflation next year soared by a full percentage point to 4.3%, the highest level since November 2023.

Affected by this, Bitcoin's hard-earned $100,000 returned to the pre-liberation period and began to fluctuate around $96,000. ETH also hovered around $2,700. Mainstream currencies performed poorly, and altcoins continued to fall.

**From a macro perspective, the Fed's caution is understandable, especially the tariff stick raised by Trump after he took office, which has made global risk aversion increasingly strong. Various signs show that tariffs have become a good hammer in their hands. They can not only be used as a diplomatic means to achieve border security, but also as an economic means to promote the return of manufacturing, and further as a way to increase revenue and reduce the federal deficit.** 

**After launching tariff threats against North American neighbors, the embryonic form of a comprehensive trade war has emerged in the United States. Although in the long run, as long as the United States controls the objects and products of taxation, such as conservatively treating trade tariffs on Canadian crude oil and Mexican agricultural products, other commodities are still controllable, but the increase in tariffs and the policy propositions of expelling illegal immigrants and embracing fossil energy are still likely to cause inflation to rise.** 

In order to preventively respond to external uncertainties and give policies more room for maneuver, conservative wait-and-see is an objective strategy that the Fed needs to adopt. At present, most of the US money markets believe that the Fed may cut interest rates in June or July, but the pricing for full-year interest rate cuts has not yet reached two. Judging from the recent interest rate cuts in March, CME's "Fed Watch" shows that the probability of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged in March is 92%, and the probability of a 25 basis point interest rate cut is 8%. No interest rate cut in March has become a market consensus.

Uncertainty is not only external, but also not calm internally. Under the banner of "cutting spending" by Musk's DOGE department, the US domestic affairs are also becoming chaotic. The official website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the highest financial regulator in the United States, was paralyzed for a time. Just a few days ago, Musk was calling for the impeachment of New York Federal District Judge Paul Engelmayer because the judge ordered a temporary restriction on the DOGE team's access to the US Treasury's payment system and sensitive data. Trump's authority is fully demonstrated under Musk's promotion, but the relatively subtle competitive relationship between the two is also being discussed by the market. All kinds of farces will only drive funds into safer areas.

**Apart from the adverse macro-effects, Trump's authority also has a bright future in cryptocurrencies. Institutional departments that once opposed cryptocurrencies are facing a comprehensive liquidation.** 

The SEC is the first to bear the brunt. Gary Gensler's departure has led to the resignation of several senior legal officials under it. The lawsuits and Wells notices that the industry once feared are gradually fading away. The SEC has begun to reduce the size of the crypto enforcement department. The SEC's shift directly benefits ETFs, and altcoin ETFs are accelerating.

The SEC recently received a series of applications related to cryptocurrency ETFs, including the Litecoin ETF application submitted by Grayscale, and BlackRock's proposal to allow the iShares Bitcoin ETF to be physically created and redeemed. Cboe also submitted four ETFs designed to track the price of XRP for listing and trading. From the current point of view, due to the lack of participation of large capital giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, the amount of funds passed by the altcoin ETF is not considerable, but physical redemption and the possible ETH pledge application will still significantly boost the subsequent sentiment.

The attitude of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of the United States has also changed significantly. Previously, the agency would even pressure banks to refuse to provide services to crypto customers in order to cut off the connection between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. But now, the FDIC announced that it is actively re-evaluating its regulatory approach to cryptocurrency-related activities, including withdrawing and replacing Financial Institution Letter (FIL) 16-2022, to provide a compliance path for banking institutions to participate in cryptocurrency and blockchain-related activities while complying with the principles of security and robustness. This move means that cryptocurrency will soon be integrated into the traditional financial system to expand the value chain, which not only enhances the security of the encryption field, but also lowers the threshold for individual users to participate in the encryption industry, laying a strong foundation for stablecoins, Payfi, BTCfi and other directions. In addition to the two, the White House's cryptocurrency agency department also brought better news. The head, David Sacks, upheld the slogan of "building a golden age of digital assets together" and took on the Bitcoin reserve, a highly concerned issue in the market. According to his speech at the press conference, Bitcoin Reserve will be included in the research topic of the White House Digital Assets Working Group, and its feasibility will be evaluated within 180 days.

In addition to the top leaders of the United States, major states have also taken the lead in applying for Bitcoin strategic reserves. 15 states, including Alabama, Arizona, and Florida, have currently launched plans related to Bitcoin strategic reserves. Arizona and Utah have transitioned to the stage of approval by both houses, and are only one step away from being approved into law.

From the previous White House statement, the US national level Bitcoin reserves focus more on the currencies already held rather than incremental purchases, but for the strategic reserves of each state, the imagination is even better. Whether it is purchased by pension funds or public finances, this is real incremental funds, which will directly bring purchasing power, thereby giving more support to the currency price and a high probability of pushing up the price of Bitcoin. At this stage, Trump's favorable policies are still continuing, and the US sovereign wealth fund under his executive order is also speculated by the market to be likely to purchase BTC.

Overall, Trump has spared no effort in supporting encryption since he took office. He has also invested in administration, supervision, and funding, and good news has come one after another. However, looking back at the market, the bleakness of altcoins is visible to the naked eye, and the rise of BTC and ETH is not optimistic.

In the final analysis, the market sentiment is too fragile. Macro expectations are eating away at investors' confidence. Risk aversion factors dominate investment, and turnover is reduced. However, due to the existence of positive factors, the mainstream currency chip gathering area is relatively stable and has not caused a big drop. Taking Bitcoin as an example, the support range of 93,000-98,000 US dollars is prominent. Even if it briefly falls below 91,000 during the Spring Festival, it will recover quickly in the future.

From the perspective of institutional trends, confidence in the future market is still there. Although the market is in garbage time, institutions are still buying. According to SoSoValue data, from February 3 to February 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs had a net inflow of $204 million per week, of which BlackRock IBIT had a net inflow of $315 million. At the same time, Ethereum spot ETFs had a net inflow of $420 million per week, and none of the nine ETFs had a net outflow. Since late January, the cumulative inflow of funds into Ethereum spot ETFs has exceeded $500 million.

**Institutions are willing to invest, and they are obviously optimistic in the long run, especially ETH, which continues to be FUD. Although the market selling pressure is strong, from the layout of BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., whether it is pledged or RWA, ETH still has hype topics. From the market point of view, in the short term, due to the lack of strong positive factors, it is a high probability event that Bitcoin will maintain volatility. It will repeatedly hover between the recent low of 90,000 and the high of 106,000. The possibility of a sharp decline is limited. The price of ETH, which lacks stabilizers, may fall further.**

But altcoins are not so lucky. According to the data, the existing supply of altcoins is obviously in excess. The total number of cryptocurrency tokens listed on CoinMarketCap is close to the 11 million mark, and there are more than 36 million altcoins in existence. In contrast, there were less than 3,000 in 2018 and 500 in 2013, which is a huge difference. Considering the current market funds, the structural dislocation of the supply and demand market is obvious.

On the other hand, Trump's own actions have also poured cold water on altcoins. The issuance of coins by himself to cut leeks has to some extent destroyed the radiation effect of the altcoin bull market that the industry originally believed, resulting in further contraction of altcoin liquidity. Under the current liquidity, PVP has become a synonym for the industry. From this point of view, except for altcoins endorsed by large capital or hyped, the negative trend of other altcoins will continue in the short term. Even Trump has fallen to $16. If we want to return to the altcoin bull market, we may have to wait until the macro environment is more relaxed.

Against this background, macroeconomic indicators still need to be paid attention to, and this week is a key week for the release of indicators. On February 11 and 12, the United States will announce the New York Fed's 1-year and 3-year inflation expectations for January, and Powell will also submit his twice-a-year monetary policy report to the U.S. Congress. The January CPI, core CPI, and PPI will also be announced on Thursday.

Being cautious and hedging may be the best market operation at the moment.
