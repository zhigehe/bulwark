Headlines
---------

**European payment giant Klarna considers integrating cryptocurrencies**

European payment giant Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said at X that Klarna will embrace cryptocurrencies, but has not yet determined a specific plan. He said that Klarna will not launch a buy now pay later cryptocurrency function, and said that the company still needs time to explore the best way to integrate. Â

MEME hot spots
--------------

**1. SlowMist: Four.Meme attackers can preemptively run liquidity pools on PancakeSwap to manipulate token prices**

Golden Finance reported that on February 11, according to the SlowMist security team, Four.Meme had been maliciously attacked, and attackers could preemptively trade by pre-creating a liquidity pool with a severely deviated price on PancakeSwap v3. Because the project party did not verify the pool price, when the token was migrated to PancakeSwap v3, the system would add liquidity based on the unbalanced pool created by the attacker, resulting in the depletion of the fund pool assets.
Currently, Four.Meme has suspended the issuance of DEX tokens, and the team is working on repairs.

**2. Meme project PAIN: 80% of the refund will be airdropped before trading begins, beware of fake claim links**

On February 11, according to the official announcement, the Meme token project PAIN will airdrop 80% of the refund amount to eligible users before the token is listed for trading. The project party stated that PAIN tokens will be directly airdropped to eligible wallet addresses, and the official contract address and token economics model will be announced through the official X account and official website.
The project leader emphasized that this distribution does not require any manual claim operation, and reminded users to be wary of fake claim links and forged tokens to prevent losses. The project team is currently working closely with partners to ensure the fairness and security of token issuance.


**3. Coinbase executives talk about the principles of listing Meme coins: try not to involve the background story of the token, but use strict standards to maintain rigor**

Golden Finance reported that Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad shared the principles of the trading platform's listing of Meme coins in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: "We try not to involve the background story of any token, but we use strict standards to ensure network security, evaluate potential fraud, and determine whether it meets securities standards. Our process remains calm and rigorous."
