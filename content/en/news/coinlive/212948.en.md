OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the cost of using any specific level of artificial intelligence is falling by about 10 times every year and may lead to a significant drop in commodity prices.

"The cost of using a specific level of artificial intelligence is falling by about 10 times every 12 months, and falling prices will lead to more use," said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a February 9 blog post on the economics of artificial intelligence.

Altman mentioned that the cost fell by about 150 times from the company's GPT-4 model in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024.

This is much faster than Moore's Law, which refers to the doubling of the number of transistors in integrated circuits approximately every two years, thereby increasing processing power, efficiency and reducing the cost of electronic devices, he said.

“In some ways, AI could be like the transistor in economics — a major scientific discovery that scales well and permeates almost every corner of the economy,” he said.

The prices of many goods will eventually fall dramatically, Altman predicted, adding: “Right now, the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy govern a lot of things.” However, the prices of luxury goods and some inherently finite resources, such as land, “will probably go up much faster,” he said.

Altman said he is willing to try various ways to make AI benefit everyone in the world, such as providing a "computing budget."

“We’re open to some strange-sounding ideas, like providing some ‘compute budget’ that would give everyone on the planet access to massive amounts of AI, but we’ve also seen that relentless focus on minimizing the cost of intelligence can produce the desired effect.”

Altman concluded that continually reducing the cost of AI will help democratize AI capabilities, with the goal of giving anyone by 2035 access to the same intelligence as everyone in 2025.

“Everyone should be able to tap into unlimited talent to direct whatever they can imagine.”

The issue of AI costs came into focus in January when a new low-cost AI model from Chinese developer DeepSeek shook the stock market and hammered U.S. companies that produce high-cost hardware, such as Nvidia.

Meanwhile, Chinese automakers, technology companies and leading telecommunications firms have integrated DeepSeek AI models into their products, Reuters reported on February 9.
