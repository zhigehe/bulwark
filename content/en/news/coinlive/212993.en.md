Tesla boss Elon Musk and a group of co-investors have submitted a nearly $100 billion acquisition offer to the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, complicating CEO Sam Altman's efforts to turn the startup into a for-profit entity.

Musk submitted a bid to the OpenAI board on Monday to acquire all of the nonprofit's assets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

Shortly after the Wall Street Journal first reported that Musk had offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, Altman said on the social networking site X: "**No, thank you**, but if you want, we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion." Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X.

Ultraman responded to Musk's offer of $97.4 billion to control OpenAI: No, thank you

Musk then commented under Altman's response post: Liar

Altman is transforming OpenAI into a for-profit company, moving the company away from its roots as a nonprofit research institution. Musk has repeatedly tried to undermine this effort, and his startup xAI is a direct competitor of OpenAI.

Last month, Musk's lawyer Marc Toberoff called on the attorneys general of Delaware and California to force OpenAI to conduct a competitive auction for the nonprofit company.

OpenAI has said it would not accept external acquisition offers for the nonprofit organization, but declined to comment on the acquisition.

Musk’s bid for the nonprofit is the latest salvo in a long-running rivalry between him and Altman. The former collaborators are now racing to dominate artificial intelligence, raising tens of billions of dollars to build massive data centers. OpenAI plans to develop $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next few years through a SoftBank-backed project called Stargate.

Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a charity. Musk invested tens of millions of dollars in the fledgling company before leaving its board in 2018. In 2019, after Musk left the company and Altman became CEO, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary as a vehicle to raise money from Microsoft and other investors. Altman is converting the subsidiary into a traditional company and spinning off the nonprofit, which will own an equity stake in the new for-profit.

Musk said the shift went against the startup’s founding mission. He has filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI, alleging that OpenAI betrayed its original nonprofit mission, created a for-profit arm, and colluded with its largest investor, Microsoft Corp., to dominate the development of artificial intelligence.

One of the main obstacles to OpenAI's transition to a for-profit organization is determining a fair value for the nonprofit, which under its current structure controls the company. OpenAI is a private company that is in talks to raise new money at a pre-money valuation of $260 billion, but it has no obligation to sell.

**Musk's offer sets a high bar, which could mean that he or whoever runs the nonprofit will end up with a large stake in the new OpenAI, perhaps even a controlling stake.**

OpenAI had discussed a valuation of about $30 billion for the nonprofit entity as part of the company's transition to for-profit, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk's lawyers believe the number should be much higher and have called for a competing bid. A higher valuation would also mean a bigger return for Musk, who would get several times his investment in the company's early years.

**Musk’s own artificial intelligence company xAI is backing the bid, which could merge with OpenAI if a deal is reached.**Musk also has support from a group of investors, including Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, Atreides Management, Vy Capital and 8VC, a venture capital firm led by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Ari Emanuel, CEO of Hollywood company Endeavor, also supports the proposal through his investment fund.

Musk and other critics have said they believe a spinoff of OpenAI could undervalue the nonprofit. OpenAI has called Musk’s legal claims unfounded and excessive, and said the nonprofit would receive the full equity value of the for-profit organization. Musk previously supported turning OpenAI into a for-profit company but backed off because he couldn’t gain control, the company said in a filing released in December.

Even before Musk’s latest move, OpenAI faced numerous hurdles in its quest to turn a charity into a for-profit company. Rival Meta Platforms sent a letter to California’s attorney general in December expressing its opposition to the plan. OpenAI is also in talks with Microsoft and other stakeholders over how much equity they should get in the new company.

OpenAI has pledged to complete the transition by the end of 2026. That effort could be made more difficult by the uncertainty about the company’s future sparked by Musk’s bid.
