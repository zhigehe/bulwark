While 2024’s volume is much higher than 2022 and 2023, it still pales in comparison to 2021, which saw the top 15 exchanges generate $25.21 trillion in annual volume during the 2021 bull cycle.

Which exchanges have lost market share since 2020?
--------------------------------------------------

OKX, HTX, and MEXC are centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that have lost market share since 2020. In 2020, these exchanges held 16.3%, 16.0%, and 16.6% market share, respectively. However, by the end of 2024, their market share had fallen to 6.2%, 4.4%, and 4.1%. While these exchanges have maintained or increased trading volumes over the years, new entrants have surpassed them.

The entry of new exchanges such as Crypto.com, Bybit, and BingX has successfully eaten into the market share of long-standing exchanges. FTX is also a major player, accounting for 2.6% of trading volume in 2021 and 4.8% in 2022. This made it the sixth largest exchange for two years before its eventual closure.
