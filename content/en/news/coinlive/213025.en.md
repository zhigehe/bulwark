Author: Biteye Source: X, @BiteyeCN

There used to be Pump.fun, which made tens of millions of dollars a day, and now there is Four.Meme, where CZ calls orders. The casino effect of the on-chain launch platform is still hot. On February 8, the long-silent DeSci (decentralized science) track also ushered in the news that the old project Pump.Science will launch a new launch platform next week. As soon as the news came out, $Rif and $Uro rebounded by 20%. Previously, Pump.Science co-founder Benjels said in an interview that he would launch 20 new compound tokens on Christmas Day 2024.

However, in fact, he postponed this action until now. In three months, with the influence of external factors such as interest rate cuts, the official tokens of Pump.Science, $Rif and $Uro, have fallen by more than 95% from their market value highs of 240m and 140m, respectively. During the same period, the DeSci financial layer project BIO also fell by about 90% from its market value high after listing on Binance. The DeSci track, which was called by CZ and Vitalik, is in mourning. It seems that this new narrative that was highly anticipated and could further achieve mass adoption has been called down by everyone.

Will the new launch platform of Pump.Science set off a wave of DeSci's revival?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to the official document of the Pump.Science community, the process of the new launch platform is:

* Users list a compound together with a token in the Pump.Science platform.
* Users can buy and sell tokens on the Bonding Curve with the same parameters as Pump.fun to support the research of this compound. 79% of the tokens are issued along the Bonding Curve. When the token market value reaches 303 Sol (of which 85 Sol is in circulation), the Bonding Curve is closed. The liquidity of 82 Sol will be migrated to Meteora for trading. 3Sol is used to pay for the corresponding worm experiment fees.

Of particular note, the Pump.Science new launch platform will implement a dynamic fee structure to deter sniper robots and prevent automated exploits during the initial token sale. Specific measures include:

* Robot deterrence: The dynamic fee structure is specifically designed to reduce front-running by sniper robots.
* Early risks: The fees for the first 150 slots (about 2 minutes) are extremely high (99.99%), which will severely reduce the number of tokens received by buyers.
* Monitoring activity: Fees drop rapidly between 150-250 slots (2-4 minutes).

Dynamic fee structure curve:

The white paper also states that all new compounds need to airdrop a certain share for the builders and holders of $Rif and $Uro. There is no doubt that Pump.Science's opening of a new token launch platform is a massive "self-rescue". The weak DeSci track urgently needs the emergence of new attention hotspots and wealth-making effects. Today, the hunters on the Sol chain have been lost in the numerous AI Agents and celebrity coins for too long and are exhausted, and the BSC chain has seen CZ's open call for diversion. Can the crisis-ridden chain rekindle the DeSci craze like Rif and Uro to open up the situation? Can the addition of new compounds, new Devs, and new attention increments activate more DeSci gameplay to attract fresh water? Three months after the DeSci project was launched, it has indeed come to a critical moment to determine whether DeSci will be revived or depressed.

90% of the over-subscription refunded, $Pain-style pre-sale of new compound EGS "full pattern" caused heated discussion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At 3:19 am on February 9, Pump.Science's official Twitter commented on its upcoming compound project $EGS @EGCGxSFN, saying, "Earning trust is the most admirable thing." Looking through Twitter, it can be found that Pump.Science's new compound project $EGS unexpectedly opened a 24-hour pre-sale window on the morning of February 7. According to on-chain data, the pre-sale wallet address of $EGS finally raised 1,223 Sol before block height 319172095. More strikingly, the project announced on Twitter that it would refund 91.87% of the raised funds, leaving only 100 Sol for token launch and liquidity support. This pre-sale "over-raising and high-refund" strategy is similar to the previously popular $pain project, but EGS's refund behavior and refund ratio have set a precedent for the DeSci project. The original tweet from the EGS project team announced, "24 hours, no marketing, no whales, we proved our trust in science." It also announced that EGS will be presented to DeSci's diamond holders in the form of a 100k market value opening, and the effective pre-sale payment has already obtained about three times the profit.

EGS is the abbreviation of the compounds Epigallocatechin Gallate and Sulforaphane. EGCG is the core active ingredient in green tea and is known as the "king of antioxidants". It inhibits cell aging by activating the AMPK pathway and removes free radicals to reduce oxidative damage. Studies have shown that EGCG can extend the lifespan of model organisms such as nematodes and fruit flies by up to 20%. Its mechanisms include inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors, enhancing mitochondrial function, and possibly delaying telomere shortening through epigenetic regulation.

Sulforaphane is derived from the "cell guards" of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, and significantly improves the antioxidant capacity of cells by activating the Nrf2 pathway. Experiments have confirmed that Sulforaphane can extend the lifespan of mice by about 15%. Its key roles include promoting autophagy to remove senescent cells, repairing DNA damage, and inhibiting chronic inflammation associated with aging (such as the NF-ÎºB pathway). Both of them delay aging through multi-target synergy, and are the few longevity candidate molecules with clinical transformation potential among natural compounds.

Obviously, the new compound inherits the previous IP monetization logic of Rif and Uro, and reduces the risk through high pre-sale refunds. This is the "low threshold and high odds" story that DeSci urgently needs. However, can such a topic-rich pre-sale gameplay, combined with DeSci's narrative of "trust in science", align Rif and Uro after the launch of the new platform? There is no definite answer. Benjels, co-founder of Pump.Science, admitted that "the problem with DeSci is that the narrative is grand, but it is difficult to implement." "Users want to support science and hope to obtain speculative returns. How to balance the two is the key." In today's market where pulling the market is justice, the single grand narrative of decentralized science has been proven to be unacceptable to the market. The road to the revival of the DeSci track is still long and arduous, and more eye-catching gameplay is urgently needed to grab the sensitive attention of the circle. I only hope that this time, Pump.Science's new compounds can bring new increments to the devastated DeSci track, and as promised in the tweet, can also give those DeSci diamond hands who are still persisting the dual comfort of wealth and spirit.

Appendix: List of new compounds from Pump.Science

* Punicalagin & Berberine: Pomegranate polyphenols, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; Berberine: AMPK activator, which can regulate blood sugar and improve metabolic health. In synergy, pomegranate polyphenols support cardiovascular health and anti-inflammatory pathways, which can complement the metabolic effects of berberine.
* Resveratrol & Berberine: Resveratrol, a polyphenol, can activate sirtuins, improve mitochondrial efficiency, and mimic the effects of calorie restriction; Berberine: AMPK activator, which can regulate blood sugar and improve metabolic health. In synergy, both resveratrol and berberine can activate AMPK and sirtuins, which may lead to longevity, metabolic control, and enhanced cell repair.
* Ginsenoside Rh2: Ginsenoside Rh2, a bioactive compound in ginseng, has anti-cancer, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.
* Aspalathin & Caffeine: Aspalathin, a bioactive flavonoid in rooibos tea, has antioxidant and blood sugar lowering effects; Caffeine, a stimulant, can improve mental and physical strength. In synergy, aspalathin can offset the potential negative effects of caffeine on blood sugar and stress hormones, providing a more balanced stimulant response.
* Gossypol & Catechin Hydrat: Gossypol, a polyphenol with potential anti-cancer and metabolic effects; Catechin Hydrat, a catechin similar to EGCG, has strong antioxidant properties. In synergy, these two compounds can jointly regulate cellular stress responses and improve metabolic efficiency.
* Biotin & Berberine: Biotin, essential for fatty acid metabolism, glucose regulation, and skin health; Berberine, metabolic regulator, improves insulin sensitivity. Together, biotin complements the effects of berberine by improving lipid metabolism and enhancing mitochondrial function.
* Urolithin A & EGCG: Urolithin A, a metabolite extracted from pomegranates, promotes mitochondria (recycling of damaged mitochondria); EGCG, a green tea catechin, has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Together, EGCG and Urolithin A both support mitochondrial function and longevity pathways, potentially improving cellular energy efficiency.
* Berberine & Quercetin: Berberine, a metabolism regulator, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers blood sugar, and supports cardiovascular health; Quercetin, a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, promotes nutrient absorption. Together, Quercetin increases the bioavailability of berberine while also complementing its metabolic effects, thereby improving glucose regulation and mitochondrial function.
* Hesperidin & DHM (Dihydromyricetin): Hesperidin, a flavonoid found in citrus, improves circulation, reduces oxidative stress, and supports vascular health; DHM (Dihydromyricetin), is used to protect the liver, support alcohol metabolism, and protect nerves. Both compounds modulate liver enzymes and inflammatory pathways, thereby enhancing detoxification and metabolic recovery.
* EGCG: Green tea catechins, with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
* Caffeine: Caffeine, a stimulant, can enhance energy, cognitive function and endurance. Liver detoxification, reduce premature death.
* Artemisinin: Artemisinin, extracted from sweet wormwood, has anti-malarial, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects.

Recently, as Binance Research once again published an article affirming the DeSci track, BIO, Rif and Uro have all risen by 20%. It seems that the DeSci wind is about to blow again. At the same time, these compounds will also be launched on the new Pump.Science platform. With such a wide range of tokens being launched, everyone needs to continue to pay attention to the high-quality tokens and select projects that are serious about work and those that are not. DYOR!
