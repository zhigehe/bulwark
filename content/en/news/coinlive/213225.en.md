Stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index and Bitcoin are completely different but complementary investment portfolios. The Nasdaq 100 Index includes the largest non-financial stocks listed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange. Bitcoin is the first public blockchain and is now the largest crypto asset by market capitalization. [1] Both the Nasdaq 100 and Bitcoin can be viewed as high-growth investments at the forefront of the digital transformation of the economy. Replacing a portion of Nasdaq-100 stock exposure with Bitcoin in a portfolio would allow investors to reduce U.S. equity concentration risk and could help optimize risk-adjusted returns.

**Nasdaq 100 returns and Bitcoin returns have a moderate correlation, with a significant difference in volatility. T**he correlation between Bitcoin’s monthly returns and the Nasdaq 100’s returns has been about 40% since 2019 (Figure 1). Meanwhile, the annualized volatility of Bitcoin’s returns is 71.5%, while the annualized volatility of the Nasdaq 100 Index is 20.5%. However, investors who hold on for many years generally compensate Bitcoin's higher risk with higher returns. During this period, Bitcoin’s cumulative returns were almost 10 times higher: the Nasdaq 100 index rose about 3 times, while the price of Bitcoin rose about 30 times. Both Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 have a Sharpe ratio of 1.0. [2]

Given these characteristics, in a portfolio with a Nasdaq 100 position, an allocation to Bitcoin and cash could potentially be used to increase expected returns, reduce risk without sacrificing expected returns, or move beyond the “efficient frontier” — that is, achieving higher expected returns without increasing volatility. As a hypothetical example, let’s consider here the potential impact on a portfolio of moving a 10% allocation from the Nasdaq 100 to a combination of Bitcoin and cash. [3]

* **Bitcoin may increase expected returns. T**he Nasdaq 100 has an annualized return of 22.2% since 2019, annualized volatility of 20.5%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.0. Assuming a portfolio with 90% allocated to the Nasdaq 100 Index and 10% allocated to Bitcoin, the annualized return is 28.8%, the annualized volatility is 22.4%, and the Sharpe ratio is 1.2 (Exhibit 2). In other words, a **Bitcoin allocation would shift the portfolio toward a higher risk and return mix, with some diversification benefits and a slightly higher Sharpe ratio.**
* **Bitcoin reduces risk without sacrificing expected returns.** Alternatively, we could consider a portfolio allocated to both Bitcoin and cash to reflect Bitcoin’s higher volatility. For example, since 2019, a hypothetical portfolio allocated 90% to the Nasdaq 100, 3% to Bitcoin, and 7% to cash would have generated an annualized return of 22.9% with a volatility of 19.4% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.1 — i.e., slightly higher returns with significantly lower portfolio volatility. This result reflects that Bitcoin offers both higher risk and higher expected returns, and therefore can improve the capital efficiency of a portfolio (similar to the strategic use of leverage).
* **Bitcoin is used to move beyond the efficient frontier. Different combinations of Bitcoin and cash (or relatively low-volatility stocks) could allow Nasdaq 100 investors to move beyond the efficient frontier — that is, to achieve higher expected returns without increasing volatility. For example, since 2019, a assuming portfolio was 90% invested in the Nasdaq 100 Index and 5% each in Bitcoin and cash would have an annualized return of 24.6% with an annualized volatility of 20.2%. In other words, **assuming a balanced portfolio of added Bitcoin and cash, the annualized return would be about 2% higher than investing in the Nasdaq 100 alone, with comparable volatility.****

Investors should consider their own circumstances and financial objectives before investing in cryptocurrencies. This asset class should be considered high risk and may not be suitable for investors with short-term capital needs and/or high risk aversion. However, for investors seeking exposure to high-growth innovative technologies, Bitcoin could complement existing allocations such as Nasdaq 100 stocks and could help investors reduce their exposure to U.S. equity concentration risk.
