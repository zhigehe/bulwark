GPT-5 is on its Way to Streamline Company’s AI Offerings
========================================================

[OpenAI CEO Sam Altman](https://www.coinlive.com/news/money-talks-elon-musk-s-97-4b-openai-takeover-attempt-met-with ) announced plans to streamline the company’s AI offerings by consolidating its diverse models into a unified system.

The decision follows the launch of DeepSeek’s simpler yet powerful AI, which has challenged OpenAI’s more fragmented approach.

As part of this shift, OpenAI will roll out GPT-5 within “weeks or months,” integrating multiple technologies, including the o3 model, with features such as voice, canvas, search, and deep research.

Emulating Steve Jobs, Altman posted on [X (formerly known as Twitter):](https://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ) 

> “We want AI to ‘just work’ for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten.”

Ahead of GPT-5, the company will release GPT-4.5, codenamed Orion, which Altman described as their “last non-chain-of-thought model.”

Currently, OpenAI’s lineup includes various models: GPT for creative tasks, “o” for reasoning, DALL·E for image generation, Sora for video, and GPT-Vision for visual understanding.

Roadmap for GPT-5
=================

Altman outlined [OpenAI](https://www.coinlive.com/news/sam-altman-quashes-rumours-on-openai-s-superintelligence-breakthrough-tells-fans)’s plan to simplify its AI ecosystem by eliminating the need for users to choose between different models.

His vision? A "magic unified intelligence" that merges the GPT and o-series models into a single, versatile system capable of handling everything from casual conversations to advanced analysis.

The transition begins with the release of GPT-4.5, codenamed "Orion".

Altman confirmed that Orion will be OpenAI’s final model built on traditional GPT architecture, marking the last iteration of the familiar ChatGPT framework.

Looking ahead, GPT-5 will introduce a fully integrated AI system that combines all of OpenAI’s technologies, including the yet-to-be-released o3 model.

This means a seamless experience where users no longer need to select a specific model for different tasks—whether it is generating images, creative writing, programming, or complex reasoning, GPT-5 will handle it all.

Additionally, OpenAI will offer GPT-5 across different subscription tiers.

Free users will have unlimited access at standard intelligence levels, while Plus and Pro subscribers can tap into enhanced capabilities.

When asked about the timeline for GPT-5’s launch, [Altman](https://www.coinlive.com/news/openai-non-profit-to-for-profit-shift-sam-altman-s-potential-10-5-billion ) simply responded: “weeks / months,” leaving room for anticipation.

OpenAI Deep Research’s Coming to Plus and Free Tier Users
=========================================================

[OpenAI](https://www.coinlive.com/news/tech-titans-elon-musk-and-mark-zuckerberg-clash-with-openai )’s advanced AI agent, Deep Research, is set to expand access beyond Pro users, reaching ChatGPT Plus and Free users in the near future.

Altman revealed that Plus subscribers ($20/month) will receive 10 uses per month, while Free users will get two.

He also hinted at plans to increase these limits over time.

Deep Research, launched in early February, is currently exclusive to ChatGPT Pro users at $200/month, offering 100 queries per month.

OpenAI touts it as a powerful tool capable of completing hours of human research in just minutes.

One user on [X](https://www.coinlive.com/news/Tweetocalypse-or-X-citing-Changes-Elon-Musk-Rebrands-Twitter-to ) noted:

> "ok, OpenAI Deep Research is worth probably $1000 a month to me. This is utterly transformative to how my brain engages with the world. I'm beyond in love and a little in awe."

To which Altman responded:

> "It probably is worth $1000 a month to some users but I'm excited to see what everyone does with it!"

> longer-term we still have to find some way to let people to pay for compute they want to use more dynamically.  
>   
> we have been really struck by the demand from some users to hit deep research dozens of times per day.

While Altman confirmed its broader rollout, he did not specify a launch date.

The announcement sparked criticism, with some users accusing [OpenAI](https://www.coinlive.com/news/competing-ai-narratives-sam-altman-and-vitalik-buterin-debate-ai-s ) of prioritising revenue over accessibility.

Others questioned whether competitors could deliver similar capabilities at a lower cost, challenging OpenAI’s pricing strategy.

> Your Framing is incorrect Sam. The question is not whether it is worth $1000/month but rather whether your competitors can give the same value for the fraction of the cost
