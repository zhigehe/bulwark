Headline
--------

**Musk on the cover of Time**

On February 8, Time featured Elon Musk as the cover character and published the article "Elon Musk's War on Washington". On the cover, Musk is wearing a suit and sitting behind a luxurious wooden desk that symbolizes power (or imitates the perseverance desk in the US President's Office). On the left behind him is the US flag, and on the right is the presidential flag, suggesting that Musk is deeply bound to presidential power and American politics. According to the article: On one side is an agency with a 64-year history, a budget of $35 billion, and its mission is clearly defined by federal law; on the other side is Musk's political sabotage team used to dismantle federal bureaucracies. They call themselves members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a group of temporary staff with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authorization.
Its power comes from Musk, the richest man on the planet, who has been tasked with dismantling much of the structure of the federal bureaucracy - cutting budgets, weakening the civil service, and depriving independent agencies of the ability to hinder the president's goals.

Game Hotspots
-------------

**1. Layer3 Game Network B3 will launch B3 tokens and airdrop on February 10**

On February 8, Layer3 Game Network B3, built on Base, announced on Friday that it will launch its recently announced B3 token on February 10, accompanied by an airdrop event. A snapshot of network activity will be taken before the planned "S1 airdrop", and there will be more airdrops, tournaments, and gamified ways to earn B3 in the future. According to a post on the X platform, B3's stakers will receive certain benefits, including tokens for dedicated game chains, early experience of new games on the network, and other potential rewards.
The post also briefly introduced the token economics: 34.2% of the token supply will be allocated to the community and ecosystem, 23.3% to the team and consultants, 22.5% to the Player1 Foundation to support the B3 ecosystem, and 20% reserved for investors. Tokens for investors, team members and consultants will have a one-year lock-up period, after which they will be unlocked monthly over the next three years. The total supply of B3 has not yet been announced.

**2. Telegram game TapSwap will launch token TAPS on BNB Chain**

On February 8, Telegram-based click-to-earn game TapSwap announced that its upcoming TAPS token will be released on BNB Chain instead of the originally planned TON network. The game originally planned to complete the token airdrop in late January, but recently stated that it had postponed the token launch in order to find better market conditions based on the advice of an unnamed "first-level" decentralized exchange. However, after completing the first season of the game on February 6, the project decided to move forward with the token launch on BNB Chain, which is expected to take place on February 14, according to an X post earlier this week.


**3. Report: Telegram game user retention rate hovers between 5-20%, far below traditional game benchmarks**

Golden Finance reported that data analysis company Helika released a report saying that Telegram game user retention rate "hovered between 5-20%, far below traditional game benchmarks (20% to 30%)."
The analysis company also said that disappointing airdrops, especially the "Hamster Kombat" airdrop, caused the "excitement" of Telegram's click-to-earn game to dissipate. After the airdrop, Hamster Kombat's user base plummeted from 300 million in August to 41 million in November.
The company added: "As the appeal of easy airdropping funds gradually weakens, the number of DAU/MAU in similar applications has declined, and the activity of the entire ecosystem has also declined."
