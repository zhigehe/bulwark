Kidnappers Threatened Torture and Death
=======================================

What began as a casual evening out quickly escalated into a nightmare for a crypto trader in Estepona, Spain.

Lured by a group of individuals to an apartment under the guise of having drinks, the trader soon found himself held captive, with the group demanding a €30,000 ransom in digital assets.

Faced with [threats of torture and death](https://www.coinlive.com/news/bitcoiner-kidnapped-and-murdered-in-ukraine-over-170k-it-might ), he pretended to comply, making a phone call to "retrieve client access codes," during which he secretly alerted a friend to his dire situation.

The friend contacted the police, but before authorities could intervene, the trader attempted a desperate escape by leaping from a 30-foot balcony, breaking both ankles in the process.

Police arrived shortly after, arresting the alleged kidnappers as they attempted to flee and raiding the apartment.
