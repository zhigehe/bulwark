After Trump, the market has been looking forward to the "Presidential Coin Launch Wave" ushered in the first participant. At around 7 am Hong Kong time today, Faustin Archange Touadera, President of the Central African Republic, tweeted:

Today, we launch CAR, an experiment to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and bring the Central African Republic to the world stage in a unique way. Contract: 7oBYdEhV4GkXC19ZfgAvXpJWp2Rn9pm1Bx2cVNxFpump.

Afterwards, the president added, "As the second president in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, I have always recognized the potential of cryptocurrency and its benefits around the world," and attached the website of the Meme token. According to Lookonchain monitoring, a certain address bought a large number of CAR tokens within one second of the president's tweet.

SlowMist founder Yu Xian also said on X that the official website announced by the South African president could not be opened, and the website domain name was registered on Namecheap 4 days ago. The token creator's funds come from Binance, and nearly 80% of the tokens are mainly distributed on 6 addresses related to the creator. In addition, Yu Xian also reminded that the official website marked by GMGN for CAR is virus-carrying, and users may accidentally infect their computers with viruses.

As the second country after El Salvador to use Bitcoin as legal tender, the Central African Republic has not received much attention. According to multiple data, the Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world.

Perhaps the national conditions can explain the rough process, and given that the account did not refute the rumor several hours after the tweet about the Meme token was published, it seems that this matter may indeed be true. According to GMGN data, the token is quoted at around $0.34 at the time of writing this article, and it has reached a high of around $1 today. The time marked as DB (Dev Buy) by GMGN was also about 5 minutes after the tweet was published.

However, the author still needs to remind readers to pay attention to the risks. Jupiter co-founder meow said that he has contacted the team that deployed CAR, but it is still impossible to confirm that the token is indeed officially launched.

Perhaps the direction of Web3 was wrong from the beginning?
===========================================================

One ​​of the most heated discussions in this round of industry is why the last bull market clearly opened up imagination for the diversity of applications, but this round of bull market has returned to hype? But what if this question itself is problematic? What if the ideas brought by the last bull market are just illusions created under the premise of unlimited quantitative easing, and DeFi, NFT and other so-called Native applications are not the answer for Web3 to continue?

"Was the direction wrong from the beginning" is the question we need to think about now. When all projects point to high returns, the premise for continuing to play music and dance can only be the continuous intervention of new funds. But the reality is that sickles are everywhere in the industry now, and there are not enough leeks. The myth of making wealth has not attracted enough users, but it has really attracted enough service providers who sell shovels and "smart people" who use convenient tools to set up games.

When many people think that Web3 is different, those disasters that have occurred in the Internet and financial fields due to infinitely magnified greed seem to be repeated in Web3. Unlimited issuance of "useless" assets is not the original intention of the birth of blockchain, but PvP will continue, and the bursting of the bubble will always be later than expected, but now it seems that the time has come to think about what the answer to the next version will be.
