Adobe’s New AI Video Tool to Rival OpenAI?
==========================================

On Wednesday, [Adobe unveiled the public version of its Firefly Video Model](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/12/meet-firefly-video-model-ai-powered-creation-with-unparalleled-creative-control?sdid=PC1PQBV3&mv=social&mv2=paid-owned&linkId=100000338795586 ), an AI tool designed to generate video clips.

While pricing details were shared, Adobe noted that it will set rates for major users like studios later this year.

Competing with OpenAI’s Sora and the startup Runway, Adobe’s offering stands out by focusing on seamless integration with Premiere Pro, [Adobe](https://www.coinlive.com/news/are-you-a-creator-adobe-s-new-app-allows-you-to )’s flagship video editing software widely used in film and television production.

[Meta Platforms](https://www.coinlive.com/news/meta-rolls-out-frontier-ai-framework-to-constrain-high-risk-ai ) has also developed a video-generation AI, though its release timeline remains unclear.

Will Adobe’s tailored approach give it a unique edge in the industry?

Adobe’s Focus on Quality Instead of Quantity
============================================

Adobe’s Firefly Video Model is designed with production efficiency in mind, allowing users to input existing footage and have the AI generate clips that enhance or extend shots that may not have been perfect.

The service creates five-second clips at 1080p resolution, a shorter duration than OpenAI’s 20-second offerings.

However, [Adobe](https://www.coinlive.com/news/adobe-express-app-integrates-firefly-ai-mobile-content-creation ) executives point out that most clips in productions typically run around three seconds.

The pricing structure offers 20 clips per month for $9.99 or 70 clips for $29.99, compared to OpenAI’s $20/month plan for 50 lower-resolution clips or a $200 plan for longer, higher-res videos.

[Adobe](https://www.coinlive.com/news/are-you-a-creator-adobe-s-new-app-allows-you-to ) is also developing a "Premium" plan for studios and high-volume users, with details to come later this year.

Alexandru Costin, Adobe's VP of generative AI, emphasized the company’s commitment to quality, focusing on 4K video generation rather than longer clip durations.

Costin explained:

> "We actually think that great motion, great structure, great definition scheme, making the actual clip look like it was film, is more important than making a longer clip that's unusable."
