‍ Lawmakers in Maryland, Iowa, and Kentucky have proposed legislation to establish strategic reserves of Bitcoin in their respective states.

The latest bill brings the number of U.S. states considering establishing Bitcoin reserves to 17, and **these proposals are intended to incorporate Bitcoin into state financial strategies**.

Kentucky House Bill 376, introduced by Rep. TJR oberts, seeks to revise the state's financial practices by expanding investment options for excess state government funds.

The bill amends the regulations governing the state investment board and authorizes investments in a variety of asset classes, including digital assets, U.S. government-backed debt, and mortgaged certificates of deposit.

**The bill requires that the market value of digital assets must reach at least $750 billion**. As of February 2025, only BTC meets this requirement, while Ethereum has a market cap of only $320.6 billion.

The bill stipulates that investments shall not exceed 10% of the total excess cash of the state fund. **The bill allows state agencies to accept digital assets and gold and silver for payment, while prohibiting the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)**.

In addition, the bill also allows state retirement funds and deferred compensation plans to invest in exchange-traded products.

The bill establishes a framework for processing digital asset receipts, ensuring conversion into U.S. dollars when necessary. At the same time, state agencies have the authority to issue regulations to regulate these investments.

House Bill 1389, introduced by Maryland Rep. Caylin Young, **proposes the establishment of the Maryland BTC Reserve Fund**.

This move positions BTC as the state's reserve asset.

The legislation authorizes the state treasurer to invest funds obtained from the enforcement of certain gambling violations in BTC, making it a unique way to accumulate digital assets.

Meanwhile, House Bill 246, introduced by Iowa Rep. Taylor Collins, outlines investment permissions for the state treasurer.

**The bill allows investments in precious metals and digital assets with a market value of more than $750 billion, and also allows investments in stablecoins**.

The state's general fund, cash reserve fund, and Iowa Economic Emergency Fund are all eligible for such investments.

The bill stipulates that **the upper limit of digital asset investment is 5% of the public funds available at the time of investment**.
