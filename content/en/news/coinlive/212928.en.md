If Musk starts to drag down the Republican Party, Trump will hear cries of “get rid of Musk” come the 2026 midterm elections.

No one is more excited than Musk in his blitzkrieg against the federal government. Musk’s posts on his social media platform X are full of emojis, responding to complaints from opponents with ? and to new suggestions from supporters for cost-cutting targets with ?.

But not everyone is laughing along with the billionaire businessman, Tesla CEO, and special government employee who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including some who might have been allies of Musk and supported what DOGE wants to achieve. Musk’s “attack the government first, ask questions later” approach could backfire and set back his efforts to solve the U.S. national debt and other problems. Musk’s aura of invincibility could quickly dissipate as political and legal problems mount and the Trump administration’s popularity falters.

“I think DOGE is a very necessary and long overdue department, but I have serious concerns about how it will perform its duties,” said David Walker, the longtime U.S. Comptroller General (head of the U.S. Government Accountability Office).

Much of the work DOGE does is private, and its structure has changed rapidly since Trump announced the department. DOGE has been heavily criticized for stoking a constitutional crisis by taking over Congress’ spending authority, and reports by Wired and other outlets that DOGE’s young employees’ access to the Treasury Department’s highly sensitive payment systems has raised concerns that Musk could try to unilaterally terminate spending that he doesn’t approve of.

Walker said: "No one wants to engage in a 'two-front struggle'. 'Two-front struggle' means that you fight for what you are doing and at the same time fight how to do it. Most people can't win a 'two-front struggle'."

The term "two-front struggle" may underestimate the opposition aroused by Musk. He has become the focus of some frustrated progressives who are not opposed to Trump's victory in 2024 as they did in 2016.

In Washington, people gathered at the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Federal Personnel Management Office to protest. At the same time, in order to prevent DOGE employees from accessing the Treasury Department's payment system, the federal employee union has filed a lawsuit. According to the latest news, a federal judge has issued a temporary injunction temporarily restricting DOGE employees' access to the Treasury Department's payment system.

A Democratic senator said he would hold a vote on the Trump administration's State Department nominees until DOGE and the Trump administration reversed plans to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

This is a strong response to the closure of USAID. The plan was initially seen as another move by a committee that would do nothing to cut the deficit, but Musk said that as the work unfolded, his goals changed.

Protesters held signs against Musk outside the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. on February 5.

On the morning of February 3, Musk said in an audio live event on X that his original intention was to try to "do a small range of door cleaning work" for USAID, and then these works turned into something more.

"When you look at USAID, it's not an apple with a worm in it, it's an apple that's been eaten by a worm. If the apple doesn't exist, then you have to throw it away," Musk said.

The fate of USAID, which is responsible for civilian foreign aid and development assistance, is currently in limbo, and many staff members have been temporarily suspended.

It's unclear how much money Musk and DOGE have saved in total by their work. A Barron's analysis of contract cancellations, office lease terminations and other cuts announced by DOGE put the figure at around $1.5 billion.

Plans to shut down federal agencies such as USAID could save more money, but many affected employees are still on payroll. Musk said he believes he can save $1 trillion in about two years.

Before he was given the power to unilaterally shut down federal agencies, Musk’s plans were unpopular in the United States. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in late December showed that 53% of voters disapproved of his role in the Trump administration, when his influence was smaller than it is now. The growing opposition will bring more challenges to every step Musk hopes to take, even if the opposition is unfounded.

Walker said: "What is happening is not communicated to the public at all, and at the end of the day, the public is angry, and they may not have to be so angry, and in many cases, the things that the public speculated about are not accurate."

Musk, the world's richest man, may be able to withstand public criticism, but being the head of DOGE is different from being the head of X or Tesla. At DOGE, Musk has a "boss" above him: US President Trump, a man known for his brutal political instincts. While often praising Musk and DOGE, Trump has also made it clear that he is the boss. "Elon can't and won't do anything without our approval," Trump told reporters on February 3. On February 7, people saw signs that the relationship between Musk and Trump was beginning to become strained. The White House said that Marko Elez, a former DOGE employee who had previously been granted access to the Treasury Department's payment system, had resigned on February 6. This came after the Wall Street Journal reported that Elez was associated with a social media account that "advocated racism and eugenics." After Elez resigned, Musk posted a poll on X asking him whether he should reinstate Elez.

The White House did not respond to reporters' requests for comment on Elez's resignation or other questions related to DOGE. Musk did not respond to reporters' requests for comment through X and Tesla. Reporters were unable to reach Elez for comment.

The midterm elections are coming up in 2026, and the Republicans may face a tough election. If Musk starts to drag down the Republicans, Trump will hear calls to “get rid of Musk.”

Democrats and Republicans have mistakenly believed from time to time that their party has finally won a permanent majority, and American history has proven them wrong every time. Musk doesn’t seem to have learned this lesson, and he is forging ahead, forgetting that the Democratic lawmakers—and some Republicans—whom he has ridiculed on social media will once again be subpoenaed.

In his newsletter Political Calculus, Oxford University political scientist Ben Ansell wrote: "Public policy cannot be made in a world where everyone who might be negatively affected by it has a veto power. Political games are bound to produce losers and winners, but deliberately crushing the losers is a sign of indifference and sometimes even sociopathic."

Whatever Musk's personality, betting against him is a risky move, as anyone who has tried to short Tesla's stock knows. Year after year, Musk has successfully consolidated his power, even when he seemed to be losing.

Musk may cause trouble for DOGE, but there is a good chance that Musk will find a way to get himself through this crisis. After all, for Musk, Washington is just another stop on the way to Mars.
