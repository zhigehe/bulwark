Author: Viee, Biteye

Each bull market not only creates wealth, but also creates countless illusions of wealth. When the market is excited, few people can stay sober and elegantly "escape the top". In the face of a market that soars and plummets, how to exit the market in a timely manner near the high point and avoid asset shrinkage caused by a deep correction requires us to comprehensively judge multiple market indicators.

In this article, Biteye analyzed 15 commonly used escape top indicators and found that one-fifth of the indicators have reached the escape top range in 24 years, namely: Bitcoin Rhodl ratio, USDT current financial management, and altcoin seasonal index. In this way, how should we deal with the subsequent development of the market?

1. Indicator introduction
-------------------------

### 1. AHR 999 Hoarding Coin Indicator

This indicator was created by Weibo user ahr 999 to assist Bitcoin fixed investment users in making investment decisions based on timing strategies. This indicator implies the rate of return of short-term Bitcoin fixed investment and the deviation of Bitcoin price from expected valuation.

Indicator range:

* >4: It is recommended to significantly reduce the position
* 1.2-4: Wait-and-see area, stay vigilant
* 0.45-1.2: Fixed investment area, you can gradually build positions
* <0.45: Strong bottom-fishing area

Current status: The indicator value is 1.21, which has not yet reached the top and is in the wait-and-see range. It is recommended to remain cautious.

### 2. AHR 999 escape top indicator

AHR 999 escape top indicator is a sister indicator of the hoarding indicator, which is specifically used to identify the market top area. This indicator determines whether the market is overheated by observing the degree of price deviation from the long-term trend line. It gave accurate early warning signals at the top of the two major bull markets in 2017 and 2021, and is an important tool to avoid chasing highs.

Indicator range:

* <= 0.45 : Severe overheating, consider escaping the top

Current status: The indicator value is 2.48 , and there is no top signal in this cycle.

### 3. Pi cycle top indicator

The Pi cycle top indicator predicts potential market tops by comparing the relationship between the 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average. Historically, when the moving averages cross, the price of Bitcoin is usually close to the top of the cycle, indicating a potential market reversal.

Signal characteristics:

* Two-line crossover: Top signal triggered
* Rapid divergence: Bearish outlook
* Gradual approach: Prompt caution

Current status: There is still a large distance between the two moving averages, and no top signal has appeared yet. The next crossover is expected to be in October 2025.

### 4. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart

The rainbow chart is an intuitive long-term valuation model that divides the Bitcoin price range into 9 different color bands. The model is based on logarithmic regression and takes into account the long-term growth characteristics and cyclical characteristics of Bitcoin. In the past market cycles, the rainbow chart has shown a good guiding role, especially in identifying extreme areas.

Indicator range:

* Red: Bubble zone, sell signal
* Yellow: Overheated zone, stay alert
* Green: Healthy zone, holding zone
* Blue: Value zone, buying opportunity

Current status: The price is in the green zone, indicating that the valuation is relatively reasonable and there is no top signal.

### 5. Bitcoin terminal price indicator

The terminal price is the transfer price multiplied by 21. The transfer price needs to divide the number of days of coins destroyed by the existing Bitcoin supply and its circulation time. This indicator can effectively filter out market speculation factors and reflect the true value of the Bitcoin network.

Signal characteristics: The closer the Bitcoin price is to the red line, the closer the market is to the top.

Current status: Not yet reached

### 6. Bitcoin market capitalization share

The market capitalization share indicator reflects Bitcoin's dominance in the entire cryptocurrency market. This indicator is usually used to judge market cycles and capital flows. When Bitcoin's market capitalization share decreases, it usually means that funds begin to shift to altcoins. Historical data shows that changes in Bitcoin's market capitalization share often indicate turning points in the entire cryptocurrency market.

Indicator range:

* 65%: Bitcoin's strong period
* 40-65%: Balanced period
* <40%: Altcoin active period

Current status: The market value accounts for about 60%, which is in a relatively balanced range.

### 7. Bitcoin CBBI Index

CBBI (Combined Bitcoin Binary Index) is a comprehensive index that combines multiple technical indicators and on-chain data, and can better identify the transition points of bull and bear cycles. Its advantage is that it reduces the limitations of a single indicator through multi-dimensional data.

Indicator range: greater than 90 means that the market has reached the top.

Current status: The index value is 79, indicating that the market is slightly hot, but has not yet reached the top.

### 8. Bitcoin MVRV Z Index

MVRV Z Index is an important on-chain analysis indicator that determines the market cycle by comparing the degree of deviation between market value and realized value. When the index is too high, it means that the market value of Bitcoin is overestimated relative to the actual value, which is unfavorable to the price of Bitcoin; otherwise, it is underestimated. According to past historical experience, when the index is at a historical high, the probability of Bitcoin price showing a downward trend increases, and attention should be paid to the risk of chasing high prices.

Indicator range: greater than 5 means that the market has reached the top.

Current status: The index is 2.5, which has not yet reached the top.

### 9. Bitcoin Rhodl Ratio

The Rhodl Ratio is a composite on-chain indicator that compares the behavioral characteristics of coin holders in different periods to determine potential turning points in the market. When the RHODL ratio begins to approach the red band, it may indicate that the market is overheated. Historically, this has been a good time for investors to take profits in each cycle.

Indicator Range: When approaching the red band, it may indicate that the market is overheated. When the ratio>= 10000, the market is close to the top.

Current Status: It has not entered the red band at present, but the indicator entered the top range during November 2024.

### 10. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple

The Bitcoin Mayer Multiple is a technical indicator used to analyze the status of the Bitcoin market, proposed by Trace Mayer. It evaluates the relative valuation level of the market by comparing the current price of Bitcoin with its 200-day Moving Average (200 DMA).

Indicator Range:

* Meyer Multiple > 1: Indicates that the current Bitcoin price is above its 200-day moving average, and the market may be overbought.
* Meyer Multiple < 1: Indicates that the current Bitcoin price is below its 200-day moving average, and the market may be oversold.
* Meyer Multiple ≈ 1: Indicates that the current Bitcoin price is close to its 200-day moving average, and the market may be in a relatively balanced state.
* Historically, when the Mayer Multiple exceeds 2.4, it usually indicates that the market is overheated and may experience a correction or bear market. When the Mayer Multiple is below 0.8, the market may be undervalued and may be a good time to buy.

Current status: The index is 1.26 , the market is overbought, but it has not yet reached the top.

### 11. ETF Consecutive Net Outflow Days

This indicator tracks the flow of funds in Bitcoin ETFs. Consecutive net outflow days often reflect the confidence of institutional investors. This is a relatively new indicator that has gradually attracted market attention since the launch of spot ETFs.

Signal characteristics:

* 10 days: significant bearish signal
* 5-10 days: need to be vigilant
* <5 days: normal fluctuation

### 12. ETF's proportion of BTC

This indicator reflects the proportion of Bitcoin held by ETFs to the total circulation, which is used to evaluate institutional participation. This indicator can reflect the acceptance and participation depth of traditional financial institutions in Bitcoin.

Current status: The proportion is close to 6%, indicating that the participation of institutions is in a healthy growth stage.

### 13. USDT current account

USDT current account interest rate is an important indicator to measure the market capital cost. This indicator reflects the overall liquidity of the cryptocurrency market.

### 14. Altcoin Seasonal Index

This indicator is used to determine whether the market has entered the active period of altcoins. By comparing the performance of Bitcoin and major altcoins, it can be determined whether funds have begun to turn to smaller currencies with higher risks.

Indicator range:

* 75 : altcoin season, more than 75 means the market is close to reaching the top
* 25-75 : balance period
* <25 : Bitcoin dominance period

Current status: The index is 41 , however, during December 2024, the indicator entered the top range, reaching 88 .

### 15. MicroStrategy Cost Indicator

This indicator tracks the average Bitcoin holding cost of MicroStrategy as a reference benchmark for institutional investors. Since MicroStrategy is one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, its cost line often becomes an important psychological price in the market.

Indicator range:

* Current price is higher than cost: Institutional profit range
* Current price is close to cost: support level
* Current price is lower than cost: potential buying opportunity

Current status: The average cost of micro-strategy is about 60,000, which is in the institutional profit range.

2. Summary
----------

"Bear market makes you bankrupt, and bull market makes you poor again." It is much more difficult to stay rational when the market is carnival and to get out of the madness than to buy at the bottom. At present, only some indicators show the signal of escaping the top, which does not mean that the entire market has definitely reached the top. If you think the market is at risk of reaching the top, you can also consider:

Set the points for reducing positions in batches, and do not expect a perfect top.

Realize profits into stablecoins or fiat currencies instead of turning to riskier altcoins.

It is better to sell early at high levels than late. Profit-taking is not the end, but the accumulation of ammunition for the next round.

Remember, every top is an opportunity for some people to make money, and it is also a wealth trap for most people. The market gives everyone equal opportunities, but those who can seize opportunities are often those who are prepared.
