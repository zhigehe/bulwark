The beaten down stock of [embattled electric vehicle maker](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/lucid-group-appoints-new-chief-financial-officer) Lucid Group [(LCID)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lcid) can rise 90% from current levels, predicts one bullish Wall Street analyst.

Mickey Legg, an analyst at investment bank Benchmark, initiated coverage on LCID stock with [a Buy rating](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/benchmark-starts-well-positioned-lucid-group-with-a-buy) and a $5 price target. Lucid’s shares closed at $2.69 on Feb. 11, putting Legg’s target price 90% above where the stock currently trades.

Legg’s bullish thesis is that U.S. electric vehicle growth will accelerated this year. Americans bought 1.3 million fully-electric vehicles in 2024, about flat when compared to 2023 sales volumes. “We view Lucid as well positioned to achieve significant share of this burgeoning opportunity based on its advanced technology, well-stocked balance sheet, and access to capital,” wrote Legg.

**Left for Dead**
-----------------

LCID stock has suffered a steep decline since the company went public in 2021. Since the initial public offering (IPO), Lucid’s [share price has declined 73%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lcid). Trading at less than $5 a share currently, Lucid is deep down on the penny stock league tables.

Many analysts have abandoned the stock. There are currently only five analyst ratings on LCID stock, and Legg’s new Buy rating is the only bullish call on the shares. Lucid has struggled with production problems and [weak sales](https://www.tipranks.com/news/lucid-group-lcid-breaks-record-sales-but-challenges-remain) for its pricey electric vehicles. The company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2024 financial results on Feb. 25.

**Is LCID Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

The stock of Lucid Group has a consensus Hold rating among five Wall Street analysts. That rating is currently based on four Hold and one Sell recommendations issued in the past three months. The [average LCID price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lcid/forecast) of $2.90 implies 3.57% upside from current levels.
