**Strategy Paused Bitcoin Buys on Disappointing Q4 Loss**
---------------------------------------------------------

The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company [paused its](https://www.tipranks.com/news/microstrategy-pauses-relentless-bitcoin-buys-but-stays-loyal-to-30b-stash) [cryptocurrency](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) acquisitions the previous week, likely due to a blackout period coinciding with its earnings announcement. On February 6, Strategy reported a notable fourth-quarter net loss. This was a huge shift from the profit reported in the same period last year. This recent acquisition was funded through proceeds from selling shares and a perpetual preferred equity offering of Strike (STRK).

Saylor, known for his cryptic yet bullish tweets, hinted at the purchase with his typical flair: “Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots.” This move reaffirms Strategy’s commitment to Bitcoin amidst a fluctuating market, signaling a strong belief in the cryptocurrency’s value proposition.
