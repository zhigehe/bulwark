U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs [(GS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gs) says investors may want to sell the [Magnificent Seven](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/magnificent-7-stocks) stocks after none of them delivered a positive earnings surprise this reporting season.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.
* Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  [Your Smart Portfolio](https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings)

David Kostin, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.tipranks.com/news/insider-trading-goldman-sachs-gs-key-executive-offloads-stock-worth-3-31m), writes, “This marks the first quarter with no positive sales surprises for the [Magnificent Seven] since 2022.” He therefore advises that investors begin shifting capital to other technology companies, specifically those involved in [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) (AI).

In a note to clients, Kostin says the mega-cap [technology stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/tech) that include Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) and Apple [(AAPL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl) can be expected to decline this year, noting that “2025 bottom-up estimates imply the excess earnings growth of the Magnificent 7 will narrow from 32 percentage points in 2024 to 6 percentage points in 2025.”

To be fair, Nvidia [(NVDA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda) has still not yet reported its financial results for the fourth and final quarter of 2024. That highly anticipated print is due out on Feb. 26.

**Other Options**
-----------------

So where should investors look beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks for investment opportunities? Kostin suggests shifting capital into what he calls “[AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) Phase 3” companies. These are companies that have potential to monetize AI through generating incremental revenues, mostly in software and information technology (IT) services.

AI Phase 2 companies are ones involved in microchip development, cloud services, security software, data-center investments, and hardware. In other words, the Magnificent Seven companies. AI stocks outside the Magnificent Seven that Kostin likes include Datadog [(DDOG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ddog), MongoDB [(MDB)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdb), and Snowflake [(SNOW)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/snow).

If [investors](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/morgan-stanley-displaced-as-goldman-sachs-main-rival-ft-reports) insist on sticking with the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Goldman Sachs likes Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) and its position related to the AI buildout.

[GS stock is up 69%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gs) over the last 12 months.

**Is GS Stock a Buy?**
----------------------

The stock of Goldman Sachs has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 16 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 12 Buy and four Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The [average GS price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gs/forecast) of $669.87 implies 3.53% upside from current levels.
