An announcement from Value Capital ( [(IL:VALC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/il:valc) ) is now available.

Value Capital announced a correction to a disrupted report, highlighting a change in holdings of securities by an interested party, Mr. Yaniv Bender, who reduced his holding through off-exchange sales. The correction involved updating identification details in the transaction report. The changes in holdings reflect a significant reduction in the percentage of total securities held by Mr. Bender, impacting the company’s share distribution. This adjustment may influence the company’s market presence and stakeholder perception as the shareholding structure evolves.
