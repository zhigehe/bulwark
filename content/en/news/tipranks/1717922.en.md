HON’s decision to split up the 119-year-old company reflects the success General Electric’s [(GE)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ge) decision to break up and marks a significant victory for activist investor Elliott Investment Management.

The company said Thursday it would spin off its aerospace division from its automation business and go ahead with previously announced plans to hive off its advanced materials business.

Activist investor Elliott, which disclosed a $5 billion stake in the company in November, had openly pushed for the company to follow the likes of GE and 3M [(MMM)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mmm) in ending its conglomerate structure.

Unsurprisingly Elliott welcomed the move, saying that it “will allow Honeywell to realize the opportunity for operational improvement and valuation upside.”

The breakup plans came as HON announced earnings broadly in line with estimates but guidance that fell short of expectations. HON stock finished Thursday down over 5%.

**HON Hopes to Unlock Value**
-----------------------------

Breaking up the business will “unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,” said Vimal Kapur, Honeywell’s Chairman and CEO. Specifically, he said a standalone automation business would be better suited to “capitalize on global megatrends” such as energy security, sustainability, digitalization and artificial intelligence.

It follows a strong pattern. GE CEO Larry Culp announced in 2021 the company would split into three companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, and GE HealthCare Technologies, creating hundreds of billions of shareholder value, with GE stock up over 400% since.

In particular, GE Aerospace has re-rated significantly since the breakup. Honeywell’s aerospace division, which has Boeing [(BA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba) and Airbus [(EADSF)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/eadsf) among its customers, makes up about 40% of annual revenues for the group but trades at a discount to pureplay peers like TransDigm [(TDG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tdg). For example, TDG 12-month trailing P/E ratio of around 52 compared to 26 for HON. A standalone aerospace business would be able to tap “unprecedented demand” in the year ahead, said Kapur.

In 2022, 3M announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business. Chemical maker DuPont [(DD)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dd) said last year it plans to split the firm into three publicly traded companies.

HON’s separation is intended to be completed in the second half of 2026.

**Is HON a Good Stock to Buy?**
-------------------------------

Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy rating on HON stock, based on eight Buys and seven Holds. The [average HON price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hon/forecast) of $251.71 reflects about 20% upside, though analysts may update their forecasts following the earnings and breakup plans.
