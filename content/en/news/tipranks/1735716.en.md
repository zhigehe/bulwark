Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, U.S. [inflation](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate) data comes out hotter than a jalapeño, sending [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) tumbling below the $95,000 mark.

**Fed’s Hawkish Stance Chills Crypto Spirits**
----------------------------------------------

The U.S. Federal Reserve isn’t making things any easier. With inflation on the rise for four straight months, Jerome Powell’s recent testimony to the Senate hinted at a sterner stance on rate cuts. This pivot to a more cautious policy approach has put the brakes on hopes for rate cuts, with the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool now showing a measly 2.5% chance of a cut come March. The market mood? Expect higher rates to linger

**Bitcoin Is at a Crossroads**
------------------------------

As traders and algorithms recalibrate, Bitcoin struggles to find its footing. Skew, a popular trader, noted on X (formerly Twitter) that despite the selloff, there’s a chance for Bitcoin to bounce back if it can leverage the stacked bids that filled during the dip. However, resistance looms large at $96,690, and if Bitcoin can’t hustle past this hurdle, it might just confirm the bears’ picnic.

Today’s market reactions have painted a clear picture: higher inflation might just be the new normal, and rate hikes could be on the menu sooner than expected. For Bitcoin, this could mean retesting waters around the $90,000 mark as traders brace for a volatile journey.

At the time of writing, [Bitcoin is sitting at $96,724.05](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd).
