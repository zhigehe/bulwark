DBS Group Holdings is a leading financial services group in Asia, headquartered in Singapore, and is renowned for its comprehensive banking services across consumer, SME, and corporate sectors. The bank has been recognized globally for its excellence in banking and innovation in digital technology.

In its latest earnings announcement, DBS Group reported a record net profit for 2024, marking an 11% increase to SGD 11.4 billion, with a return on equity sustained at 18.0%. The total income for the year grew by 10% to SGD 22.3 billion, driven by an increase in net interest margin and a significant rise in fee income and markets trading income.

Key financial highlights include a 5% rise in commercial book net interest income to SGD 15.0 billion, with net interest margin expanding to 2.80%. The bank’s fee income reached SGD 4.17 billion, largely due to a 45% increase in wealth management fees, while markets trading income saw a 27% rise to SGD 922 million. Operating expenses also rose by 10%, primarily due to increased staff costs.

The bank’s board has proposed a final dividend of 60 cents per share and announced a new quarterly Capital Return dividend for the financial year 2025. DBS continues to maintain a strong liquidity position with a liquidity coverage ratio of 147% and a net stable funding ratio of 115%.

Looking ahead, DBS management remains optimistic about future performance, underpinned by digital transformation and strategic initiatives, despite prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties. The bank is well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge and deliver robust financial returns.
