Orion Energy Systems ( [(OESX)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/oesx) ) has issued an update.

On February 11, 2024, Orion Energy Systems announced voluntary salary and retainer reductions for its executive officers and board members as part of temporary cost-saving measures. The company also reported improved financial results for the fiscal 2025 third quarter, including a gross margin increase to 29.4%, reduced net loss, and break-even adjusted EBITDA. Orion’s reorganization into two business units aims to enhance sales and marketing effectiveness, aligning with its focus on long-term growth. Despite lowering its FY 2025 revenue outlook due to project delays and market conditions, Orion’s strategic moves, such as cost reduction and business realignment, position it for better performance in FY 2026.
