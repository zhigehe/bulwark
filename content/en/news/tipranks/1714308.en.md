Lately, however, the Golden Arches have hit a bit of a rough patch. Comparable sales have dipped for two consecutive quarters, thanks to industry-wide headwinds and fierce predatory pricing — especially with grocery stores. With [Q4 2024 earnings on deck for Monday, February 10th, before the opening bell](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd/earnings), I’m taking a neutral stance on the stock. The outlook remains blurry, particularly on the pricing front. I’d rather wait and see if value-driven strategies can bring back customers and boost sales.

If we dive deeper into the latest developments regarding McDonald’s stock and discover what investors can expect on February 10th, it becomes clear there are as many risks as rewards lurking within this fast food chain.

**Is McDonald’s Sizzling or Losing its Flavor?**
------------------------------------------------

Over the last twelve months, McDonald’s performance has been marked by unusually high volatility for a low-beta stock with defensive characteristics.

As shown in the chart below, McDonald’s shares hit a low of $245 in July last year, quickly rising to $316 at their peak three months later. After the Q3 earnings report (despite beating EPS and revenue estimates), the stock lost momentum and is now trading around $293 per share, marking a modest ~5.5% increase over the past year, a significant underperformance compared to the broader market.

The volatility over the past six months can be attributed to positive decisions—such as the [$5 meal deal success](https://www.tipranks.com/news/mcdonalds-teams-up-with-coca-cola-on-5-meal-deal-campaign), maintaining an average check north of $10—and adverse events that have impacted the company. First, McDonald’s same-store sales have been negative for two consecutive quarters—down 1% in Q2 and 1.5% in Q3—driven mainly by the International segment.

One of the main reasons for these negative figures is the increased share of grocery sales compared to the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) category. As Wedbush analyst [Nick Setyan](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/nick-setyan) [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvUGGTYYoJ4), grocery transactions are up 13% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, while restaurant industry transactions have declined roughly the same amount.

Late last year, an [E. Coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s food](https://www.tipranks.com/news/mcdonalds-stock-tumbles-on-e-coli-outbreak-analysts-debate-the-implication) affected around a hundred people slowed the stock’s momentum and potentially led to a slight decrease in store traffic heading into Q4.

**What to Expect from McDonald’s Q4 Earnings?**
-----------------------------------------------

This time, for Q4, McDonald’s reports earnings with more modest expectations from Wall Street. Over the last three months, all stock analysts lowered their EPS and revenue estimates. To register a market beat, McDonald’s must report EPS of over $2.85 per share, representing a ~3% year-over-year drop, and revenues of $6.48 billion, a modest 1% increase from last year.

[![McDonald's (MCD) earnings forecast for upcoming earnings announcement on February 10th 2025.](https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-06-02-25-at-10.37-1-1024x468.jpeg)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd/forecast)

While the lower expectations for McDonald’s could make it easier to beat across the board and lead to a buoyant stock reaction, there’s no guarantee. After all, even last quarter’s beat on the top and bottom lines wasn’t enough to push the stock higher.

I believe that the main topic of conversation during earnings day will be the effectiveness of McDonald’s recent value meal initiatives in the face of struggles with comparable store sales and how much this will impact margins. The core of the bearish thesis on McDonald’s has been precisely the high price competitiveness with grocery stores, where, as the quarters progress, McDonald’s prices are becoming less and less competitive compared to supermarkets, based on wage growth and food cost inflation.

Although McDonald’s doesn’t provide quarterly guidance, recent industry-wide challenges have already been factored into the consensus, with the top and bottom lines expected to be weak in Q4. That said, new value initiatives could help boost traffic.

**McDonald’s Valuation: A Risky Premium with Strong Dividends**
---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the reasons I’m neutral on McDonald’s stock is that its current valuation aligns with the multiples you’d expect from a defensive income stock. McDonald’s is trading at 20x its cash flow, which is nearly an 84% premium compared to the industry and pretty much in line with its average over the past five years. While I don’t think McDonald’s, as the market leader, should be valued the same as the rest of the industry, this premium could be risky, especially with its tough industry-wide challenges.

On the bright side, McDonald’s trades at a forward free cash flow yield of 3.74%, above the average of 3.25% over the last five years. Overall, these FCF yields suggest that McDonald’s is generating sufficient free cash flow to support its dividend payments and that dividend growth should continue. In the last twelve months, McDonald’s [dividend yield](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd/dividends) stood at 2.34%, marking 23 years of consecutive dividend growth, but it still looks unattractive considering a 10-year Treasury yield of 4.4%.

**Is McDonald’s (MCD) a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**
---------------------------------------------

Although McDonald’s stock consensus among Wall Street analysts is predominantly bullish, there is some reluctance for a more positive outlook. Of the 20 analysts covering the stock in the last three months, 12 have given a Buy rating, while eight have a Hold rating. The average price target is $324 per share, which implies an upside of 10.5% from the current price.

The average price target represents a 10.50% change from the last price of $293.22.](https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MCD2-1024x351.jpg)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd/forecast)

**Big Macs, Big Challenges: What’s Next for McDonald’s?**
---------------------------------------------------------

McDonald’s remains a dominant force in fast food, but recent challenges highlight the need for adaptability in a competitive market. While its long-term stability and strong cash flow are undeniable, declining sales and pricing pressures raise concerns. With Q4 earnings just days away, the company’s ability to counter grocery store competition and drive traffic through value-focused strategies will be critical.

Expectations for Q4 are low, which could work in McDonald’s favor if results exceed forecasts. While I anticipate weak revenue and profit growth, there’s potential for a traffic surprise. Going into the earnings call, I’m staying on the sidelines and waiting for more consistent sales trends before considering a bullish stance on the stock.
