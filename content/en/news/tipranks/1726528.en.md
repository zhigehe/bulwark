Amot has released a financial report detailing its liability status as per the repayment schedules outlined in the Securities Regulations, highlighting a total liability of over 10 billion NIS. The report indicates that Amot’s liabilities are primarily in the form of bonds issued to the public, with significant principal payments scheduled over the next five years. There is a notable absence of private bonds or non-banking credit, suggesting a reliance on public bond markets. This strategic approach may impact Amot’s financial flexibility and interest obligations in the coming years, reflecting its operational focus and market strategy.
