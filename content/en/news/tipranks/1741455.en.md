**Robinhood’s Q4 Breaks Records as Crypto Frenzy Ignites Growth**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[The company’s Q4 revenue surged to $1.01 billion](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hood/financials), marking a year-over-year increase of over 115%. A key driver of this growth was an eight-fold jump in transaction-based revenue from crypto trading, which reached $358 million in Q4.

This surge was fueled by renewed interest in digital assets, with [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) [(BTC)](https://www.tipranks.com/etf/btc) surpassing the $100,000 mark following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.”

Interestingly, Robinhood’s stock reacted swiftly, climbing nearly 14% in early trading, reaching its highest level since 2021, and adding about $6 billion to the company’s market value.

**Wall Street Analysts Lift Price Targets**
-------------------------------------------

Several analysts responded to Robinhood’s impressive performance by raising their price targets, citing strong execution, expanding market share, and continued crypto momentum:

One such analyst is Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler, who lifted his price target to $75 from $54, maintaining an Overweight rating. He highlighted Robinhood’s strong earnings growth and broader product range, noting its ability to adapt and expand across multiple asset classes.

Similarly, analyst [John Todaro of Needham](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-todaro) boosted his price target to $70 from $52, reiterating a Buy rating. He highlighted Robinhood’s 60% EBITDA margins in Q4, fueled by substantial transaction growth across equities, options, and crypto. Todaro noted that the company’s ability to sustain high-margin operations positions it well in a volatile trading environment.

In addition to these, Bernstein SocGen Group analyst Gautam Chhugani raised his price target to $105 from $51, maintaining an Outperform rating. Calling Robinhood the firm’s “best idea for 2025,” he forecasted record trading volumes and sustained crypto momentum. Chhugani said its expanding market share and growth strategy reinforce its role in the changing financial sector.
