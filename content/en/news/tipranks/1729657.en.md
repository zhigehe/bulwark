G.U.D. Holdings ( [(AU:AOV)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:aov) ) has shared an update.

Amotiv Limited reported a 2.3% revenue growth to $503.7 million for the half year ending December 2024, driven by acquisitions in their Powertrain and Undercar, and Lighting, Power, and Electrical segments. Despite these gains, the company experienced a 35.8% drop in net profit after tax due to impairments in their New Zealand operations and restructuring costs. The company has managed to implement operational efficiencies and cost management strategies, yet faces challenges such as increased freight costs and a weak macroeconomic environment in New Zealand and the RV/caravan markets, leading to lower gross margins and a decline in underlying EBITA by 1.0%.
