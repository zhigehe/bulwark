Coming after lenders successfully sold $5.5 billion of loans that had been stuck on their books for over two years it marks another big win for the banks and for Musk.

Both *Bloomberg* and the *Financial Times* reported that Morgan Stanley was aiming to price the secured loans paying 9.5% in interest with no discount after they secured sufficient demand for the paper.

It marks the third sale in a month for the Twitter buyout financing and would take the total to $9.5 billion. MS first sold $1 billion of debt at around 90-95 cents on the dollar while the $5.5 billion tranche was sold at 97 cents on the dollar.

That only leaves about $3 billion left on their balance sheets to offload.

**Big Win for MS and other Lenders**
------------------------------------

Seven banks, including MS, Bank of America [(BAC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bac) and Barclays [(BCS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bcs), put up around $13 billion in financing to help Musk secure Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. The other banks involved in the deal were Mizuho [(MFG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mfg), MUFG [(MUFG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mufg), Société Générale [(SCGLY)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/scgly) and BNP Paribas [(BNPQY)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bnpqy).

While they had hoped to provide temporary financing for Musk, the loans have been left lingering on their balance sheets as his attempt to back out of the transaction rattled would-be investors. The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise [interest rates](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators) quickly also dampened enthusiasm for the transaction among investors.

However, Musk’s own personal stock – and therefore the ability of the banks to sell the debt – has been rising alongside the election of President Donald Trump. It’s thought that Musk’s proximity to the President and role within the White House will help rather than hinder his business interests.

X’s stake in Musk’s [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) startup xAi has also helped sentiment towards the debt.

**Is MS a Good Stock to Buy?**
------------------------------

Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on MS stock, based on five Buys and 10 Holds. The [average MS price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ms/forecast) of $143.50 implies almost 5% upside from current levels.
