The [bold prediction](https://www.tipranks.com/news/winklevoss-backed-gemini-gears-up-for-ipo-amid-crypto-revival) was made as part of ARK Invest’s “bull case scenario​” for the largest [cryptocurrency](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) by market capitalization. If the prediction proves true, the price of BTC will have risen 1,465% from the current level of $95,800 at which it trades.

In ARK Invest’s worst-case scenario, Bitcoin will increase to $300,000 within the next five years. The firm’s base case scenario has BTC trading at $710,000 by the start of the next decade. “Bitcoin is on pace to meet our 2030 price targets,” says ARK Invest in a report, citing increased adoption as digital gold, rising institutional investment, and a tightening supply as key drivers of future growth.

**Game-Changer**
----------------

ARK Invest called the advent of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) a year ago a “game-changer” for the entire [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) sector, noting the record-breaking launch and red hot growth of the ETFs. “On their first day of trading, the spot [Bitcoin ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd/technical-analysis) attracted over $4 billion of inflows, a record high for ETF launches,” states ARK Invest.

The firm also cites [corporate interest in Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/news/standard-chartered-says-bitcoins-btc-price-to-hit-500000-by-2028) as a key catalyst, noting that public companies now hold over $55 billion worth of BTC, a five-time increase since 2023​. Lastly, Cathie Wood’s firm says Bitcoin’s position as “the most decentralized and transparent monetary asset in history,” is a key reason for investors to remain bullish on the crypto.

[The price of BTC has gained 113%](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) over the last 12 months.
