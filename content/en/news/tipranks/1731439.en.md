**U.S. and UK Break Ranks**
---------------------------

Vice President JD Vance voiced a strong opposition to what he perceives as stifling regulations proposed at the AI Action Summit. “Restricting the development of AI now would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations,” he declared to *Reuters*. This emphasized a stark departure from cautious European approaches. Meanwhile, the UK aired its grievances regarding the summit’s language, fearing it might compromise their own strategies for AI innovation, as noted by *BBC*.

Despite the controversy, 60 countries embraced the summit’s ambitious goals. They signed a statement advocating for AI to be “transparent,” “safe,” and “secure.” The signatories also committed to launching an AI public-interest platform and creating a network to monitor AI’s impact on jobs. Essentially, the focus was on responsible technology development.

**Europe Clashes with the U.S. on AI Strategy**
-----------------------------------------------

The [European Union’s recent AI Act](https://www.tipranks.com/news/eus-ai-act-and-investor-implications), which sets a regulatory framework for AI, stands in sharp contrast to the U.S.’s aggressive push for unfettered innovation. “We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias,” Vance stated at the summit. This seems to hint at a growing rift between U.S. policy and the international consensus on AI governance.

Echoing this sentiment, Russell Wald from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) warns, “Safety is not going to be the primary focus, but instead, it’s going to be accelerated innovation and the belief that the technology is an opportunity,” he noted to *Reuters*.
