BioVaxys Technology ( [(TSE:BIOV)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:biov) ) has provided an update.

BioVaxys Technology Corp. has announced a potential delay in filing its annual financial statements due to the complexities involved in auditing its recent acquisition of intellectual property and assets from IMV Inc. The company is proactively seeking a management cease trade order from the British Columbia Securities Commission to address any filing delays, which would prevent its management from trading shares but not affect other stakeholders. This situation highlights the company’s commitment to transparency and suggests that operational and strategic integrations, like the DPX platform, will continue unhindered by this temporary setback.
