E-commerce giant Amazon [(AMZN)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn) has finally seen its revenue surpass that of retail king Walmart – 10 years after Amazon’s market cap surpassed Walmart’s in 2015. At that time, Amazon’s revenue was only about one-fifth of Walmart’s, but Amazon’s diverse portfolio of businesses, which includes cloud storage, advertising services, cloud services, video streaming, and artificial intelligence, has led to significant growth during this timeframe.

In fact, although retail remains the company’s largest segment, its cloud business is growing rapidly, with sales rising 19% last quarter. For reference, Amazon’s online sales, excluding Whole Foods and third-party services, rose 7% to $75.6 billion.

As a result, investors who bet on Amazon’s growth story have been rewarded handsomely. Indeed, if you had bought Amazon stock on the day its market cap surpassed Walmart’s, you would be up 802% today, compared to Walmart’s 331% gain. Interestingly, these figures significantly outperformed the broader market, with the S&P 500 [(SPX)](https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx) gaining 193% over the same period.

**Truist Remains Optimistic**
-----------------------------

Although Amazon’s past performance is interesting, the more important question for investors now is where will the stock go from here? According to Truist, led by 4.5-star analyst Youssef Squali, the answer is higher. Even though the firm trimmed its price target from $270 to $265 per share, it still recommends buying the stock. Truist remains optimistic about Amazon’s long-term potential due to its strong position in e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, and logistics. The firm also believes Amazon’s stock is undervalued, which makes it a compelling investment opportunity.

**Is Amazon Stock Expected to Rise?**
-------------------------------------

Overall, analysts seem to agree with Truist. Indeed, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 43 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a [35% rally in its share price](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn) over the past year, the [average AMZN price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast) of $265.48 per share implies 15.5% upside potential.
