**Recent Updates on Tesla Motors stock**

Recent developments surrounding Tesla Motors (TSLA) highlight a mix of achievements and challenges. Despite missing Q4 earnings expectations with a 38% EBIT miss and the lowest margins in years, Tesla’s shares rose, driven by optimism over future projects. Tesla reported record vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle globally in 2024. However, challenges such as production hurdles, regulatory concerns, and competition, particularly from Chinese [EV](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/electric-vehicles) makers, remain. Analysts have mixed views, with [RBC Capital](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/firms/rbc-capital) recognizing the potential of Tesla’s “moonshots” like unsupervised Full Self Driving by June 2025 and Optimus robots ramping in 2025. Price targets for Tesla varied, with some firms like Roth MKM increasing their targets, while others remain cautious. The company’s future growth plans, including new vehicle models and expansions in autonomy and energy storage, are seen as key drivers, despite short-term financial underperformance.
