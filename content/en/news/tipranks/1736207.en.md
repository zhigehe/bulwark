The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance have approached a federal judge in Washington, D.C., seeking a temporary halt to their ongoing enforcement actions. This strategic pause is part of the SEC’s effort to reevalute the murky waters of digital asset regulations through its newly established [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) task force. The outcome of this pause could significantly influence the ongoing Ripple (**[XRP-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd)**) litigation. This reflects a potential shift in the SEC’s regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies.

**Ripple Could Benefit from the SEC’s New Strategy**
----------------------------------------------------

The ongoing legal battle involving Ripple demonstrates the broader uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, views this development as a possible turning point in the SEC’s enforcement strategy. Stark suggests that this could lead to favorable resolutions for cases like Ripple’s, or perhaps even a complete reassessment of pending litigation within the sector.

**Stark Issues a Grave Warning**
--------------------------------

Despite the possible softening of the SEC’s stance, Stark remains vocal about the risks inherent in the crypto industry, particularly its association with fraud and criminal activities. He argues that diminishing the SEC’s crypto enforcement could unleash widespread regulatory challenges, likening the potential fallout to a contagion that could affect the entire global market.

After a recent legal win against the SEC, Ripple’s XRP has seen a significant uptick in market confidence, [now trading at $2.4457](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd).
