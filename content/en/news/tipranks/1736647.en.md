The Pall Mall and Lucky Strike owner said it expects “significant regulatory and fiscal headwinds” in Bangladesh and Australia to impact performance in traditional cigarette sales in 2025.

Despite it booking a £6.2billion ($7.74 billion) hit from outstanding litigation in Canada, the company reported annual profit from operations of £2.7 billion, up from a loss of £15.8 billion last year.

However, shares in London [(GB:BATS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:bats) fell over 9% as revenues missed forecasts for the year, falling 5.2%, driven by the sale of its businesses in Russia and Belarus in September 2023. Moreover, cigarette volumes were down by 5% on an organic basis, a steeper decline than the broader industry’s 2% contraction last year.

Guidance was muted with the company saying it expects adjusted profit to grow between 4% and 6% next year, alongside revenue growth of 3-5% in 2026 as it shifts focus to smokeless products.

While management would like to tell a story of smokeless products replacing declining cigarette sales, BTI reported new product revenue growth of just 2.5%, albeit on an organic basis the 8.9% looks healthier.

**Canada Lawsuit Costs Weigh**
------------------------------

The litigation costs in Canada relate to a decade-old landmark court ruling in Quebec that found the company and two other cigarette makers had failed to sufficiently warn customers of the health risks associated with smoking. BTI, Philip Morris [(PM)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pm) and Japan Tobacco [(JAPAF)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/japaf) were ordered to pay CA$15.6 billion in damages

Commenting on the results today, CEO Tadeu Marroco  said, “We are committed to Building a Smokeless World and becoming a predominantly Smokeless business by 2035.”

Smokeless products such as Vuse and Velo, now account for 17.5% of the group’s revenue, after it added 3.6 million customers to this category last year.

**Is British American Tobacco a Good Buy?**
-------------------------------------------

Turning to the London-listed shares, BATS is rated a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, three Holds and one Sell. The [average BATS price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:bats/forecast) of 3,335.71p implies around 8% upside. BATS trades on the NYSE under the ticker $BTI.
