Thai Beverage Public Company Limited reported a 2.4% year-on-year increase in sales revenue for the first quarter ended 31 December 2024, driven by significant growth in the beer and non-alcoholic beverage segments. The beer business saw an 8.0% increase in sales revenue and a 16.6% rise in EBITDA, attributed to lower raw material costs and effective marketing strategies.
