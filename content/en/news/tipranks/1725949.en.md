AMMO, Inc. has announced a delay in filing its Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) for the period ending December 31, 2024. The delay is primarily due to ongoing issues related to financial reporting and internal controls, as identified during a Special Committee’s investigation of past financial periods. This investigation is focused on various financial management issues from 2020 to 2023. The company is unable to file the report within the prescribed due date or the five-day extension due to the complexity of these issues. While the investigation is expected to conclude soon, AMMO has not provided a specific timeline for filing the delayed report. The financial impact remains uncertain until the investigation is complete, with the company committed to restating financial statements for the affected periods. In the meantime, AMMO is actively working on improving its internal controls and has emphasized its commitment to transparency. The notification was signed by Jared R. Smith, the CEO of AMMO, Inc.
