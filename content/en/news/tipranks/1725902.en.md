Northeast Bancorp’s recent earnings call revealed a robust financial performance marked by record achievements in several key areas. The sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting impressive growth in loan origination, SBA loans, and net income. Despite facing challenges such as increased FDIC costs and variable purchase loan volumes, the overall outlook was optimistic.

Record Loan Origination
-----------------------

Northeast Bank achieved a milestone this quarter by originating $246 million in loans, setting a new record. This accomplishment underscores the bank’s strong position in the lending market and its capability to sustain high levels of loan origination.

Record SBA Loan Origination
---------------------------

The bank also reported a record in SBA loan origination, reaching $100.3 million. Of these, $64.5 million were sold, resulting in a gain of $5.6 million. This highlights the bank’s strategic focus on small business lending, contributing significantly to its revenue.

Record Net Income
-----------------

In terms of earnings, Northeast Bank reported a record net income of $22.4 million, excluding the impact of PPP loan sales in fiscal 2021. This reflects the bank’s effective management and profitable operations.

Increase in Tangible Book Value
-------------------------------

The tangible book value of the bank increased by $4.49 or 9% since September 30, further rising by $5.95 or 13% over a six-month period. This growth in book value is a positive indicator of the bank’s financial health and shareholder value.

Improved Asset Quality
----------------------

Asset quality saw significant improvement, with the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans decreasing from 106 basis points to 84 basis points. This reduction demonstrates the bank’s successful risk management strategies.

Improved Liquidity Position
---------------------------

Northeast Bank enhanced its liquidity position with $430 million in on-balance sheet liquidity and over $1 billion in off-balance sheet capacity. This robust liquidity ensures the bank’s ability to support future growth and meet its financial obligations.

Increased FDIC Costs
--------------------

A notable challenge this quarter was the increase in FDIC costs, driven by the growth of the bank’s balance sheet. While this poses a cost challenge, it also reflects the bank’s expanding asset base.

Lumpy Purchase Loan Volume
--------------------------

The quarter saw below-average loan purchase volumes due to the withdrawal or delay of several sizable portfolios by sellers. This variability in loan purchase volumes presents a challenge in maintaining consistent growth.

Forward-Looking Guidance
------------------------

Looking ahead, Northeast Bank remains optimistic about its growth prospects. The bank achieved $361 million in loan volume, with $246 million in originations and $100.3 million in SBA loans. With a record net income of $22.4 million and a base net interest income of $45.6 million, the bank is well-positioned for continued success. Its strong capital ratios and improved asset quality provide a solid foundation for future growth.

In conclusion, Northeast Bancorp’s earnings call painted a picture of a thriving financial institution with record-breaking achievements in loan origination and net income. Despite facing some challenges, the overall sentiment was positive, with a focus on strategic growth and financial stability as the bank looks to the future.
