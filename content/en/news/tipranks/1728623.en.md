Gencor Industries, Inc. has announced a delay in filing its Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) for the financial period ending on December 31, 2024. This delay is primarily due to a change in the company’s independent auditing firm. Previously, MSL, P.A. was merged with Forvis Mazars, LLP, leading to the dismissal of MSL and the appointment of Forvis Mazars. This transition has necessitated additional time to complete the audits of the financial statements and internal controls for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. The company is unable to specify an exact date for the filing but assures that it will be filed as soon as reasonably practicable. Despite these delays, Gencor has indicated that there are no expected significant changes in financial results from the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. Gencor continues to work on compliance with its filing obligations, as noted by Eric E. Mellen, Chief Financial Officer, who signed the notification.
