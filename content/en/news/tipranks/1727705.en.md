Holmes Place ( [(IL:HLMS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/il:hlms) ) has shared an update.

Holmes Place faces a [class action](https://www.tipranks.com/class-action-lawsuits) lawsuit in the Tel Aviv District Court, following a claim by a subscriber that the company unlawfully increased monthly subscription fees by 1% due to a VAT rate hike. The lawsuit, representing all affected subscribers, seeks compensation estimated at 2.5 million NIS, although the company believes the legal grounds for the fee adjustment make the lawsuit’s success unlikely.
