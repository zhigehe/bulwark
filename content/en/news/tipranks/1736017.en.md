**OpenAI Is Making a New System that Thinks Deeply**
----------------------------------------------------

OpenAI calls the next step Orion, or GPT-4.5 for those who like the official tags. It’s basically the final version before we get the new version, which is GPT-5. The idea behind this is pretty straightforward: they’re working to make a more [unified and powerful](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/openais-altman-updates-on-product-roadmap) [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) system. Instead of having separate models for different tasks, Orion aims to bring everything under one roof. Sam Altman, the CEO, says that this isn’t just about making an AI that can handle more tasks; it’s about creating one that thinks more deeply before it responds. This means we can expect future versions to not only be more efficient but also to offer richer, more thoughtful interactions.

**GPT-5 Is Smarter and More Aware**
-----------------------------------

GPT-5 is more than just a simple update. It brings in the reasoning skills from the o-series, particularly the o3 model, which means it’s going to be smarter and more aware of the context it’s working in. This should help cut down on errors and boost how well it performs across the board. The idea is to make this AI handy for all kinds of tasks, whether you’re crunching complex numbers or coding up something new. Essentially, GPT-5 is being built to work smarter and make our lives a bit easier when we lean on it for help.

Furthermore, Sam Altman is making sure everyone gets a shot at using GPT-5, not just those who pay. Even if you’re using it for free, you’ll get to try it out, though they’re putting some checks in place to keep things under control. Premium and pro users will enjoy a more advanced version, which could significantly enhance how they use AI in their projects.
