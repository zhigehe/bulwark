For Q4 2024, Albemarle reported net sales of $1.2 billion and a net income of $75 million, showcasing a recovery from the previous year’s losses, despite a decrease in sales primarily due to lower pricing and volumes in its Energy Storage segment. The full year saw net sales of $5.4 billion and a net loss of $1.2 billion, impacted by restructuring charges and asset write-offs. However, the company achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, attributed to cost improvements and volume growth.

Strategic highlights included optimizing its conversion network and reducing capital expenditures by over 50% for 2025, signaling a focus on cost savings and efficiency improvements.
