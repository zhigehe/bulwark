Northpointe currently has $5.4 billion in assets.

**Improving IPO Market**
------------------------

The U.S. IPO market has been in the doldrums since the bear market of 2022. However, the situation now looks to be improving. Northpointe Bancshares is listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NPB” and has said that it plans to use its IPO proceeds to fund future growth.

Castle Creek, a private equity firm that invests in community banks, paid $25 million in 2019 for a 27% stake in Northpointe. It is the bank’s largest shareholder. While the IPO of Northpointe Bancshares is relatively small in dollar terms, it is one of the largest market debuts by [a U.S. bank](https://www.tipranks.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-moves-closer-to-having-asset-cap-lifted) in the last decade.

Northpointe was founded in 1999 as a mortgage-focused lender serving the U.S. Midwestern states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. It has since grown and now offers retail banking products in addition to mortgages and home loans.

**Is NPB Stock a Buy?**
