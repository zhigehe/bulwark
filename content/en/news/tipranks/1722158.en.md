An update from Platina Resources Limited ( [(AU:PGM)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:pgm) ) is now available.

Platina Resources Limited has initiated diamond drilling at the Xanadu Gold Project’s Xanadu Deeps target, following a Western Australian Government grant that covers up to 50% of the drilling costs. The project aims to explore deeper sulphide mineralisation within a 10km corridor, potentially unlocking the full value of the site. Initially, drilling will focus on the Cleopatra South prospect to investigate an aero-electromagnetic anomaly, targeting deeper mineralisation that was previously inaccessible due to challenging drilling conditions.
