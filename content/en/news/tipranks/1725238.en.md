Import tariffs under the new administration of U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) [look unavoidable](https://www.tipranks.com/news/canada-avoids-u-s-tariffs-for-30-days-as-border-measures-strengthened) at this point. But there are some sectors of the economy and stocks that might prove immune to the new duties.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.

The latest sector to get upended by Trump’s tariffs is manufacturing after the U.S. president announced 25% import duties on aluminum and steel products. At the same time, the U.S. has gone ahead with 10% tariffs on most imports from China. The situation has roiled financial markets and many individual stocks.

However, economists and analysts say there are some sectors that could escape the tariffs and potential trade wars relatively unscathed. For investors, finding these stocks could mean the difference between gains and losses in their portfolios.

**Tariff-Proof Stocks**
-----------------------

Sectors that might be tariff-proof include software, as coding often requires little more than an internet connection and a set of fingers. Very little is imported into the U.S. in the [software space](https://www.tipranks.com/news/msft-earnings-microsoft-stock-falls-on-weak-cloud-computing-growth). For this reason, some analysts are recommending stocks such as Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft), Salesforce [(CRM)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm) and ServiceNow [(NOW)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/now).

Utilities based in the U.S. are another relatively safe sector of the economy, particularly energy utilities that produce power from American-sourced oil, natural gas and coal. The insular nature of some of these stocks protects them from potential trade tariffs, note analysts, who recommend stocks such as [Dominion Energy](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/d/forecast) and NextEra Energy [(NEE)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nee).

[Bank stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/bank-stocks) are another safe bet. While banking is international and transactions frequently cross borders, it is almost entirely done through electronic money transfers and trades. The most common import in the banking sector are people moving to offices in foreign countries. For this reason, analysts say stocks like JPMorgan Chase [(JPM)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jpm), Bank of America [(BAC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bac), and Swiss bank UBS [(UBS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ubs) could be good bets.

**Is MSFT Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

The stock of Microsoft has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 32 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 29 Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average price target on MSFT stock](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast) of $510.90 implies 24.18% upside from current levels.
