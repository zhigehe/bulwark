WH Smith ( [(GB:SMWH)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:smwh) ) just unveiled an announcement.

WH Smith PLC has announced the purchase of 23,400 of its own ordinary shares as part of a buyback program initiated in September 2024. This move, authorized by shareholders, is part of a broader strategy to manage the company’s share capital and potentially enhance shareholder value. The buyback program, since its inception, has resulted in the company purchasing over 1.5 million shares, which are intended to be canceled, thereby reducing the total number of shares in circulation. This action demonstrates WH Smith’s commitment to optimizing its capital structure and could have implications for its market positioning and shareholder dynamics.
