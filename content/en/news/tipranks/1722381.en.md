U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) has just slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. This has resulted in a temporary tumble in [cryptocurrency](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) values. The new 25% tariff, heralded on February 9th, targets steel “coming into the United States” with an iron grip. Trump’s rationale? It’s a tit-for-tat game, where he aims to match the 130% import fees some countries levy against U.S. goods. “If they are charging us 130% and we’re charging them nothing, it’s not going to stay that way,” [Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) declared, signaling a tough stance on trade imbalances.

**Crypto Markets Stagger, Then Steady**
---------------------------------------

Following Trump’s announcement, the [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) sector witnessed a sharp but brief decline. Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, dipped from its perch above $97,000 to $94,000 before clawing its way back up.

[Ethereum](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd) mirrored this resilience, dipping to $2,537 only to bounce back to $2,645. Despite the scare, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies shrank momentarily from $3.15 trillion to $3.10 trillion, settling later at $3.13 trillion, according to *Cointelegraph*.

**A Glimpse of Recovery amidst Fear**
-------------------------------------

The mood in the crypto sphere has been cautious, shadowed by the broader implications of a burgeoning trade war. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a barometer for market sentiment, hovered in the “fear” zone, reflecting investor unease.

Yet, the market’s recovery post-tariff announcement showcases the resilience and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies against macroeconomic shocks. As the dust settles, investors should track the [cryptocurrency markets on TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency), especially with Trump’s threat to extend tariffs to other commodities and partners like the EU and China.
