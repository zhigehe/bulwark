Solana’s (**[SOL-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd)**) price took a nosedive, falling over 6.25% to hit around $194.50. The drop coincided with a broader [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) market sell-off triggered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest remarks. During his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on February 11, Powell maintained a hawkish stance on interest rates. This has caused many investors to shy away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

**Fed’s Hawkish Tone Rattles Crypto**
-------------------------------------

Powell’s recent comments put a spotlight on the [Fed’s careful stance on rate cuts](https://www.tipranks.com/news/ethereum-and-layer-1s-gain-ground-as-memecoins-lose-steam). He pointed out the robust health of the U.S. economy and warned against tweaking monetary policy too quickly. Following his speech, there was a noticeable rise in both short and long-term Treasury bond yields. This change made traditional assets more attractive than riskier options like Solana. With everyone keeping a close eye on the Fed’s next moves, the CME FedWatch tool now indicates a 95.50% chance that [interest rates](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators) will remain unchanged in March, putting a damper on the crypto market’s mood.

**Solana Could Face a Steep Drop**
----------------------------------

Technical patterns are also not in Solana’s favor. The [cryptocurrency](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) is currently forming the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic bearish indicator. If Solana breaks below the neckline support at $180.50, it could potentially plummet by another 40% to around $109.21. If Solana manages to stay above this key support level, it could set the stage for a rally back up to $215, which would challenge the current bearish outlook.

**Long-Term Optimism Remains**
------------------------------

Despite the current turbulence, some industry insiders are still optimistic about Solana’s future. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, is firmly confident in Solana’s potential, predicting a 150% increase over the next five years.

Speaking to *Hall of Flame*, Mumtaz stated, “I’m confident in saying that Solana will be a trillion-dollar asset and that it will go above $500. I’d be very surprised if Solana is not at $500 in five years.” His long-term perspective demonstrates the underlying strength he sees in Solana, despite short-term market fluctuations.

At the time of writing, [Solana is sitting at $196.44](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd).
