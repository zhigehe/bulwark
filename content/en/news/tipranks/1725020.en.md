Integral Metals Corp. ( [(TSE:INTG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:intg) ) has shared an announcement.

Integral Metals Corp. has advanced its exploration at the Burntwood Project in Manitoba through a comprehensive 2024 field program, aiming to evaluate and discover new zones of rare earth element (REE) mineralization. Supported by collaborative funding from NSERC, Mitacs, and MMDF, the program employed advanced techniques such as geomicrobial and biogeochemical sampling, collecting a substantial number of rock, soil, and black spruce samples to enhance mineralization models. The Manitoba Geological Survey’s parallel mapping efforts identified numerous carbonatite dikes, supporting the area’s REE potential and suggesting increased density and size of intrusions, which could significantly impact Integral Metals’ exploration strategy and positioning within the industry.
