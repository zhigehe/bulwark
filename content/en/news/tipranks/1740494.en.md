Cronos Australia Ltd. ( [(AU:VIT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:vit) ) has issued an update.

Hortican Inc., formerly known as Cronos Group Holdings Inc., has announced a change in its substantial holding in Vitura Health Limited, an ASX-listed company. This change was a result of dilution following the issuance of new shares by Vitura Health, which reduced Hortican’s voting power from 10.06% to 8.40%. This shift in voting power could impact Hortican’s influence over company decisions and reflects a strategic adjustment in its investment portfolio.
