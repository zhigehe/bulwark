“GameStop is exploring it, but nothing is final,” a source close to the company stated. Any potential investment would require approval from either a special committee or the full board.

**Ryan Cohen’s Cryptic Post Fuels Buzz**
----------------------------------------

Adding to the excitement, [GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo featuring Michael Saylor](https://www.tipranks.com/news/gamestop-gme-stock-surges-after-ceo-ryan-cohen-posts-photo-with-strategys-michael-saylor), the co-founder of Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr) (formerly MicroStrategy), a company known for its massive Bitcoin holdings. The post quickly went viral, sparking speculation that GameStop might adopt a similar approach by integrating Bitcoin into its balance sheet.

However, sources clarified that Saylor is not directly involved in the company’s [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) discussions.

**Crypto Ambitions Spark Market Excitement**
--------------------------------------------

GameStop has dabbled in the crypto space before, launching an NFT marketplace and a digital wallet in 2022. However, the company shut it down in 2023, citing regulatory uncertainty.

Now, with $4.6 billion in cash on hand, along with very little long-term debt (less than $10 million), Bitcoin is reportedly on the table as a strategic investment.

While investors await confirmation, a crypto move could signal a major shift for GameStop, drawing new interest while facing market volatility and regulatory hurdles.

**Is GME Stock a Buy?**
-----------------------

Currently only one analyst follows GME stock, Wedbush’s Michael Pachter. He has a [price target on the stock of $10](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gme/forecast), which is 62.14% below where the shares currently trade.
