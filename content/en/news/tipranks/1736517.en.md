Unilever [(UL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ul) will list its demerged ice cream business in Amsterdam, London and New York, the company said today as it posted underwhelming full-year results.

The ice cream business, which includes brands such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s, generated turnover of €8.3 billion ($8.62 billion) in 2024. The business will be incorporated in the Netherlands and will continue to be headquartered in Amsterdam.

Its primary listing will be in Amsterdam and will be chaired by Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, currently chair of Vodafone Group [(VOD)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vod) and non-executive director of Heineken [(HEINY)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/heiny), having been chief executive of the Dutch brewing giant for 15 years.

It marks something of a coup for Amsterdam after Unilever combined its dual Anglo-Dutch structure to a single London-based entity. Shell [(SHEL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/shel) also ended its dual share structure in 2022, dropping its listing in Amsterdam in favour of London.

**Unilever Sales Growth Falters**
---------------------------------

The news came as Unilever reported sales rose 4% in the Fiscal fourth quarter as price rises remained subdued despite “strong performances” from its core “power brands” Dove, Comfort and Vaseline.

Unilever [(GB:ULVR)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:ulvr) shares in London declined over 6% as the company also reported underlying sales growth of 4.2% in the year to December, a little beneath expectations for growth of 4.3%, with volumes up 2.9% and pricing softer at +1.3%.

Overall turnover was marginally down on last year, while net profits were down over 10% to €6.4 billion.

CEO Hein Schumacher added that growth in the first half of 2025 would be soft despite big spending on brand marketing at 15.5%, the highest in over a decade. The company raised its dividend by 6.1% and announced a new €1.5 billion share buyback.

**Is Unilever Stock a Good Buy?**
---------------------------------

Overall, Wall Street rates ULVR a Moderate Buy, based on 11Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets for Unilever in the last 3 months. The [average ULVR price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:ulvr/forecast) is 4,881.96p, implying around 10% upside from current levels. The stock is traded in New York under the ticker $UL.
