It must be noted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized a cautious stance on monetary policy during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. He stated that the [Fed will maintain the current interest rates](https://www.tipranks.com/news/fed-chair-jerome-powell-doesnt-expect-interest-rate-cuts-anytime-soon), citing persistent inflation and the need to assess the impact of previous rate hikes.
