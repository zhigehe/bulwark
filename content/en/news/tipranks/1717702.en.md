Stock indices finished today’s trading session in the red. The [Nasdaq 100](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100) ([**NDX**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)), the S&P 500 ([**SPX**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx)), and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.tipranks.com/index/dow-jones) ([**DJIA**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/dow-jones)) fell 1.3%, 0.95%, and 0.99%, respectively. Earlier today, the U.S. economy showed signs of slowing down but is still growing at a healthy pace. The latest jobs report revealed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 143,000 in January, with unemployment falling to 4%.

While this growth is slower than in previous months, economists say it’s still strong enough to keep the economy on track. In fact, the labor market has been so resilient that it’s helped to drive consumer spending and keep the economy expanding.

However, rising [inflation](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate) expectations are a concern. A University of Michigan survey showed that consumers expect prices to rise faster in the year ahead due in part to President Trump’s tariff policies. This has led some economists to predict that the Federal Reserve will keep [interest rates](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators) on hold for the foreseeable future. The central bank has already cut interest rates by a full percentage point last year, and it may be waiting to see how the economy responds to those cuts before making any further moves.

Despite these concerns, the overall picture is one of a moderating but still strong labor market. Job growth is being driven by industries like healthcare, retail, and government, while wages are rising at a steady pace. The average hourly wage increased by 0.5% in January, and it is up 4.1% over the past year. The Fed is likely to keep a close eye on inflation expectations, but for now, it seems content to keep interest rates steady.
