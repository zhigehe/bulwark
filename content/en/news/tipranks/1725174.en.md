The higher energy consumption is due to a growing number of [Bitcoin miners](https://www.tipranks.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-predicts-bitcoin-btc-will-reach-1-5-million-by-2030) trying to secure the digital asset. Large banks of computers are used to mine Bitcoin around the clock, solving complex mathematical equations and puzzles that are needed to mint new BTC.

Those banks of computers consume a substantial amount of electricity, which has been one of the main criticisms of [cryptocurrency](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) mining. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index reflects the energy consumption per Bitcoin mined. It peaked at an all-time high earlier in February as [interest in cryptocurrencies](https://www.tipranks.com/news/winklevoss-backed-gemini-gears-up-for-ipo-amid-crypto-revival) grows.

**Alternative Energy Sources**
------------------------------

Bitcoin mining has risen around the world in recent months as the price of the largest digital asset by market capitalization has increased. Countries that have seen spikes in Bitcoin mining include the U.S., Norway, Germany and Spain. While Bitcoin mining increases, so too have efforts to curtail energy use, say analysts.

Some miners are turning to renewable solar power to help power the banks of computers they use to produce new Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Other miners are curtailing their activities during periods of peak electricity use and selling excess power back to electrical grids. These measures have helped bring down the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin, say analysts.

**Is BTC a Buy?**
