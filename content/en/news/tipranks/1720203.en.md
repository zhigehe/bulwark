Ackman highly praised Uber by calling it “one of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world.” He believes the company’s stock is undervalued and can be purchased at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. Ackman hinted that he will share more about his investment thesis for Uber in the near future.

The billionaire’s disclosure of Uber comes after the [company released its Q4 earnings report](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/uber/earnings), which showed mixed results. While Uber’s bookings and revenue growth were strong, the company slightly missed expectations for bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter. Nevertheless, the company’s valuation seems to have been appealing enough for investors to pile in following its stock’s initial plunge after posting the results.
