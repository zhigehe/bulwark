An announcement from Baru Gold ( [(TSE:BARU)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:baru) ) is now available.

Baru Gold Corp announced an amendment to the terms of its 13,136,799 outstanding common share purchase warrants. The expiry dates of these warrants, originally set for February and March 2025, will be extended to July and August 2025 with an exercise price of $0.10 per warrant. This amendment is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, and none of the warrants are held by insiders. This change reflects the company’s strategic financial management and could influence investor interest by providing extended timeframes for warrant exercise.
