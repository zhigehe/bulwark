Friedman Industries, Incorporated is a manufacturer and processor of steel products, operating primarily in the flat-roll and tubular segments with facilities across several U.S. states. The company recently disclosed its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, marking a challenging period due to pricing pressures and political uncertainties, which impacted sales volumes and margins.

The company’s third-quarter sales were approximately $94.1 million, with a net loss of $1.2 million compared to a net income of $1.2 million in the same period the previous year. Despite a reduction in debt by 9% and an improved sales backlog volume, sales and profits were lower than expected due to decreased steel prices and holiday disruptions.

Key financial metrics included a working capital balance of $107 million and operating cash flow of $2.7 million. The flat-roll segment recorded a significant drop in sales and operating profits, while the tubular segment faced a decline in sales prices. The company also managed to gain $0.3 million from its hedging activities.

Looking ahead, Friedman Industries anticipates improved sales volumes and margins in the fourth quarter, driven by increased order activity and rising steel prices. The company remains optimistic about its long-term position in the industry and is prepared to leverage upcoming market opportunities.
