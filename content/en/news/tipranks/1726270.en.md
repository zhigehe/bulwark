ON Semiconductor Corporation faces significant risks in its pursuit of capturing market share in the [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) power technologies sector. The intense competition among semiconductor manufacturers to develop innovative AI solutions could hinder their ability to meet customer demands promptly, potentially leading to financial setbacks. Moreover, the company must navigate the complex landscape of legal, social, and ethical challenges associated with AI, as any misuse or improper deployment by third parties could undermine public trust and adoption of AI technologies.

The average ON [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/on/forecast) is $69.37, implying 47.47% upside potential.
