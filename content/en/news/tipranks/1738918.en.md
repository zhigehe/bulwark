Mynaric AG ( [(DE:M0YN)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/de:m0yn) ) just unveiled an update.

On February 13, 2025, Mynaric AG announced that it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq due to its initiation of restructuring proceedings under the German Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act. The delisting follows Mynaric’s failure to meet several Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining a minimum market value and holding an annual meeting. Trading of the company’s American Depositary Shares will be suspended on February 18, 2025, highlighting significant challenges in Mynaric’s financial positioning and its immediate operational impacts.
