Netflix [(NFLX)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx) is planning to add video podcasters to its streaming platform as it looks for new content that will help drive future growth.

The move to add video podcasters comes as streaming growth in Netflix’s traditional television shows and movies [begins to slow](https://www.tipranks.com/news/nflx-dis-para-entertainment-stocks-hit-as-trade-war-threatens-hollywood-productions) in some markets around the world, and with viewing time stuck at around 60 minutes per day.

The push to add video podcasters follows a similar move by Alphabet-owned [(GOOGL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl) YouTube, which has found success with video podcasts of people such as sports broadcaster Bill Simmons and DJ Akademiks. Many audio podcasts such as The Joe Rogan Experience and Bill Maher’s Club Random are also video taped and uploaded to platforms such as YouTube.

**Cost Effective**
------------------

Netflix has shown a willingness to branch out into [new content areas](https://www.tipranks.com/news/netflix-secures-buy-rating-from-redburn-atlantic-on-advertising-growth-potential) and tweak its formula as needed. Over the past few years, the company has pushed into live events and sports, broadcasting NFL football fames and Formula 1 races, as well as weekly wrestling programs and even a hot dog eating contest.

The podcast industry is booming with 500 million global listeners and counting. Video podcasts are also seen as a more cost effective way for the company to add new content. Currently, Netflix is the top spender on content, shelling out $14.5 billion a year to produce movies and television shows.

Some analysts, such as Wall Street firm Bernstein, applaud Netflix’s podcast strategy, saying it could strengthen the company’s ecosystem, boost engagement, and keep its subscribers hooked for longer periods of time.

[NFLX stock has risen 84%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx) over the last 12 months.

**Is NFLX Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

Netflix stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 40 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 28 Buy, 11 Hold, and one Sell ratings issued in the last three months. The [average NFLX price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx/forecast) of $1,100.57 implies 8.07% upside from current levels.
