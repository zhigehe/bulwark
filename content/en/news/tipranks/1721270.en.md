The latest announcement is out from Dasin Retail Trust ( [(SG:CEDU)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sg:cedu) ).

Dasin Retail Trust has received a letter from New Harvest Investments Limited, a major shareholder, regarding an Interim Arbitral Award against Mr. Zhang Zhencheng and Aqua Wealth Holdings Limited. The award restricts them from actions that could terminate or replace Dasin Retail Trust Management as trustee-manager, including convening or voting at extraordinary general meetings. This legal development, upheld by a Singapore Court Order, aims to stabilize the management structure amidst shareholder requisitions for meetings.
