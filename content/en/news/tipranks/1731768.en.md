After hitting that high, Dogecoin didn’t just crash; it settled into what’s called a consolidation phase. This is when the price moves sideways—no big highs or lows, just cruising. This phase is like the calm before the storm in trading terms, setting up for the next big price leap.

In late 2024, Dogecoin broke through a trend line that was holding it back since its peak in 2021. This is a big deal—it means Dogecoin might have ended its consolidation phase and could be gearing up for another price sprint.

**Federal Reserve Fuels Crypto Momentum**
-----------------------------------------

Amid these technical signals, the broader economic backdrop plays an important role. The Federal Reserve’s hints at easing up on interest rate hikes could sweeten the pot for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower [interest rates](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators) typically make investors more adventurous, tilting them towards dynamic markets like crypto, where the stakes and potential rewards are higher.

[Currently priced at $0.2542](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/doge-usd), Dogecoin is showing early signs of an upward trajectory. If it can surpass the $0.26 threshold, it might just set off on the path to reach the anticipated $2.43.
