As the [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) market matures, XRP (**[XRP-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd)**) and Solana (**[SOL-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd)**) are leading the charge toward securing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals. Recent developments suggest a pivotal shift from previous regulatory restrictions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally recognized a Solana-based ETF application and has begun processing multiple proposals for XRP ETFs. This progress marks a significant turn from the stringent regulatory era under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

The betting markets are alive with speculation, with Polymarket traders favoring Solana slightly over XRP, assessing an 85% to 80% chance for a 2025 approval. These bets reflect growing confidence in the prospects of crypto ETFs.

**A New Regulatory Era Has Begun**
----------------------------------

Under what some are calling the first crypto-friendly U.S. presidency with Donald Trump, the regulatory landscape appears more welcoming than ever. This new administration marks a departure from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s era of rigorous enforcement, suggesting a brighter future for [crypto innovations like ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/news/sec-sparks-hope-by-acknowledging-xrp-solana-and-litecoin-etf-filings).

**Solana Faces Challenges and Seizes Opportunities**
----------------------------------------------------

Despite Solana’s promising advancements and its role in high-volume trading activities, it faces regulatory hurdles due to ongoing legal disputes over its classification as a security. These challenges could delay SEC approval until as late as 2026, although its operational use could present a compelling case for earlier consideration.

**XRP’s Legal Clarity Could Be Its Trump Card**
-----------------------------------------------

On the other hand, XRP might have an edge thanks to the legal clarity gained from a U.S. District Court ruling, which stated that XRP is not inherently a security. This partial legal victory provides Ripple and XRP a firmer standing in the ETF race, possibly simplifying their path to approval. However, Ripple’s influence over XRP raises concerns about centralization, a significant factor that the SEC may consider in its evaluation process.

**Could Litecoin Outpace Both?**
--------------------------------

As speculation mounts, some industry insiders suggest that Litecoin (**[LTC-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/ltc-usd)**), with its longer history and established market presence, might leapfrog both XRP and Solana in securing an ETF. The brief appearance of a CME Group web page suggesting Litecoin futures, although quickly retracted, has fueled further speculation about its potential lead in the ETF race.

**What Is the Best Bitcoin ETF to Buy?**
