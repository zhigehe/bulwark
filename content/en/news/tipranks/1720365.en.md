Redishred Capital ( [(TSE:KUT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:kut) ) has shared an update.

VRC Companies, LLC has completed the acquisition of Redishred Capital Corp. in an all-cash transaction valued at CA$5.00 per share. As a consequence of this acquisition, Redishred’s shares will be delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange, and the company will cease to be a reporting issuer under Canadian securities laws. This strategic move could enhance VRC’s position in the information governance market, as Redishred’s operations align with VRC’s aim to increase productivity and reduce costs for enterprise and SMB-sized companies throughout the information lifecycle.
