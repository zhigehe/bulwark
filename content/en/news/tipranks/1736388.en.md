ABG Sundal Collier reported a strong performance for Q4 2024, with revenues rising 15% year-on-year, driven primarily by the debt capital markets segment due to high investor interest in high-yield bonds. The annual revenue also saw a 13% increase compared to 2023. Despite modest equity market activities in 2024, the company managed to advise on two major IPOs in the Nordics during Q4. Additionally, ABGSC maintained a leading position in public-to-private transactions and experienced consistent contributions from its brokerage and research businesses. As they look forward to 2025, ABGSC plans to enhance market share and expand services with the launch of a Private Banking operation.
