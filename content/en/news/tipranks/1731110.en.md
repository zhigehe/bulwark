According to Joel Kruger, a strategist at LMAX, the crypto’s momentum is picking up with “many medium and longer-term players stepping in to take advantage of the recent dip.” This sentiment is echoed by a report from 10x Research, which highlights upcoming catalysts like [next month’s Pectra upgrade](https://www.tipranks.com/news/ethereum-takes-big-strides-towards-fixing-its-interoperability-puzzle-in-2025) and potentially [favorable U.S.](https://www.tipranks.com/news/bitcoin-braces-for-impact-as-u-s-cpi-report-could-stir-the-crypto-waters) [inflation](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate) data that could fuel Ether’s ascent.

**Technical and Economic Catalysts Align**
------------------------------------------

Ether’s technical indicators are flashing signs of a turnaround; the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped to near 35%, historically a precursor to a rebound, 10x Research noted. The [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) community is also eyeing Wednesday’s U.S. [CPI](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate) inflation report, which, if aligned with forecasts, could bolster market sentiment further, pushing ETH prices higher.

As Ether battles with a key resistance level at around $2,650, breaking through could pave the way for a climb to the next major resistance at $3,000. This would represent a significant gain from current levels, offering a potential 13% increase in value. The broader altcoin market’s dynamics also play a role, with Ether shedding 20% of its value over the past month amid a wider market downturn.

**Challenges Remain amidst Hedge Fund Bets**
--------------------------------------------

Despite the optimistic technical outlook, Ether faces challenges from [hedge funds](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/hedge-funds) ramping up their short positions as they bet against the crypto’s recovery. The increase in shorts, up over 500% since the U.S. presidential election, suggests a cautious or bearish outlook from some market participants. This setup could lead to a “short squeeze,” where a rapid price rise could force short sellers to buy back Ether, potentially driving prices even higher.

At the time of writing, [ETH is sitting at $2,619.10](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd).
