Separately, Super Micro aims to file its 2024 annual report, along with quarterly reports for the September and December 2024 periods, by February 25. This move comes after the company delayed filing its quarterly reports due to allegations of improper accounting, which led to an internal review.

In addition, Super Micro has secured $700 million in funding through a private placement of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes that will be due in 2028. The company also renegotiated the terms of its existing Convertible Senior Notes that are due 2029. Super Micro plans to use the proceeds from the private placement for general corporate purposes.

**SMCI’s Guidance for Q3 2025**
-------------------------------

Looking forward, management has provided the following guidance for Q3 2025:

* Q3 revenue between $5 billion and $6 billion versus estimates of $5.976 billion
* Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.46 to $0.62 compared to expectations of $0.66

As you can see, guidance was significantly worse than expected but had little impact in after-hours trading because shares had already plunged almost 10% in today’s regular trading session.
