Goliath Resources, a company engaged in mineral exploration in the Golden Triangle area of British Columbia, has announced significant findings from its drilling operations at the Surebet site. The company discovered strong gold mineralization, including five new stacked gold veins that remain open, suggesting an extensive gold-rich source at depth. These findings affirm the continuity and expansion potential of the gold system, which is considered world-class due to its size and grade. The ongoing assays and modeling efforts for additional drill holes indicate potential growth and enhanced value for the company and its stakeholders.
