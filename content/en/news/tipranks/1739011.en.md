Nvidia’s [(NVDA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda) stock price has been experiencing a rebound in February despite a decline in retail investor purchases. According to *Vanda Research*, retail investors bought a net $34 million worth of Nvidia stock on Monday, which was a significant decrease from previous levels and suggests that individual investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the stock. However, institutional investors, also known as “smart money,” appear to be taking advantage of the lower stock price. Still, it is worth noting that institutional option flows in the name have yet to rebound strongly.

Nevertheless, analysts have been defending Nvidia’s stock ahead of its earnings report on February 26 by pointing to the company’s strong position in the [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) market. Indeed, five-star Evercore analyst [Mark Lipacis](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-lipacis), who has a $190 price target, believes that Nvidia remains the platform of choice for hyperscalers’ customers due to a robust software ecosystem and development community that puts it 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors.

In addition, Bank of America’s five-star analyst, [Vivek Arya](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/vivek-arya), remains bullish on Nvidia with a $190 price target of his own. Arya expects Nvidia to reassure investors about its Blackwell execution and show that it is confident about its Fiscal Year 2026 outlook, which could help to further boost the stock price.

**What Are Retail Investors Looking For?**
------------------------------------------

As retail investors exit Nvidia, they appear to be looking for other tech momentum names, such as Palantir [(PLTR)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr). According to Vanda Research, Palantir has seen record demand from retail investors, with $339 million in net purchases in the trailing week. This surge in interest has occurred despite “[relentless insider selling](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr/insider-trading),” which could be a bearish indicator.

**Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?**
--------------------------------

Overall, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. After [an 83% rally in its share price](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda) over the past year, the [average NVDA price target of $178.86 per share](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast) implies an upside potential of 31.9% from current levels.
