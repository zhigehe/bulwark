Other crypto companies planning to go public include crypto exchanges Gemini, Kraken and Bullish, as well as stablecoin issuer Circle. The slew of crypto IPOs come as [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) trades near $100,000 and the administration of U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) ushers in a [friendlier regulatory environment](https://www.tipranks.com/news/goldman-sachs-ramps-up-crypto-investments-with-2000-boost-in-ether-etfs).
