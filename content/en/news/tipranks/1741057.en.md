An announcement from Aeon Metals Ltd. ( [(AU:AML)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:aml) ) is now available.

Aeon Metals Ltd. is undergoing a restructuring process under a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA), which involves a transfer of all company shares to OL Master Limited (OCP) for no consideration. This restructuring is subject to court approval through a Section 444GA Application process, as the shares are deemed to have no value. Shareholders and creditors have the opportunity to oppose this transfer, but an independent expert report supports the restructuring by confirming the shares hold no residual equity value.
