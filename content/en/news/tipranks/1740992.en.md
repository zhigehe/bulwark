Curtiss-Wright Corporation is a global integrated business that provides highly engineered products, solutions, and services mainly to Aerospace & Defense markets, as well as critical technologies in demanding Commercial Power, Process, and Industrial markets.

Curtiss-Wright Corporation has announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, reporting record sales, profitability, and free cash flow. The company also issued its guidance for 2025, reflecting expectations of higher sales, operating margin expansion, and double-digit EPS growth.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Curtiss-Wright reported sales of $824 million, a 5% increase from the previous year, and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.27, a 3% rise. The company achieved a 19.8% adjusted operating margin, with free cash flow reaching $278 million. For the full year 2024, sales rose 10% to $3.1 billion, with adjusted EPS up 16% to $10.90. The company saw robust demand across its Aerospace & Defense markets, including new orders totaling $3.7 billion, a 20% increase.

Curtiss-Wright’s performance in 2024 was driven by strong growth in the defense markets, particularly in naval defense and commercial aerospace. The Naval & Power segment saw a 12% increase in revenue, while the Aerospace & Industrial segment experienced a 5% growth. However, the Defense Electronics segment faced a 5% decline in sales due to timing issues in some defense programs.

Looking ahead to 2025, Curtiss-Wright projects a sales growth of 7% to 8%, supported by strong demand in its A&D and Commercial Nuclear markets. The company anticipates a 40 to 60 basis points expansion in operating margins, along with continued investments in R&D and a double-digit EPS growth. The strategic acquisition of Ultra Energy is expected to contribute positively to the company’s performance, aligning with its long-term growth objectives.
