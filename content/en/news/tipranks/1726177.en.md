Get ready to write this on your calendars for 2025, because according to *Bloomberg’s* top ETF analysts, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is leaning heavily towards giving the green light to a spot Litecoin ETF. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas pegged the approval odds at a [whopping 90%, towering over its](https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-and-solana-sprint-towards-historic-etf-approvals) [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) counterparts like XRP (**[XRP-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd)**), Solana (**[SOL-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd)**), and [Dogecoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/doge-usd) (**[DOGE-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/doge-usd)**), with chances pegged at 65%, 70%, and 75%, respectively. “Litecoin’s straightforward regulatory filings and its commodity status make its path to approval less tangled,” Seyffart shared on X.

**Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Lead the Charge**
--------------------------------------------------

The crypto ETF space isn’t just about Litecoin. Seyffart and Balchunas spotlighted the explosive demand seen by [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) and [Ethereum](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd) spot ETFs, which have scooped up $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion in net inflows, as per Farside Investors. Though Litecoin might not mimic these giants in demand, it still holds potential. “Even a modest $50 million can be significant for fund companies,” Seyffart told *Cointelegraph*.

**Clock Ticks on Crypto ETF Approvals**
---------------------------------------

With the final decision from the SEC expected between October 2 and 18, the race is on. But it’s not just about Litecoin; filings for lesser-known players like Hedera and Polkadot are also in the mix, awaiting their fate without set odds just yet.

Beyond these immediate contenders, the future looks packed with potential filings. “We’re seeing issuers take a spaghetti cannon approach: launch a variety and see what sticks,” Seyffart noted. Balchunas also added an interesting observation, noting that prior to Donald Trump’s election win, most crypto [ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/etf) had less than a 5% chance of seeing the light of day.

**What Is the Best Bitcoin ETF to Buy?**
