9R Limited ( [(SG:1Y1)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sg:1y1) ) has issued an announcement.

9R Limited reported a significant increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, totaling S$3.4 million, up from S$1.3 million the previous year. This growth was driven by the expansion of its lifestyle retail business segment, partially offset by declines in its supply chain business due to weak demand. The company’s gross profit also saw a substantial rise, although administrative expenses increased due to higher costs associated with the new outlets.
