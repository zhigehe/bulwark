Through six weeks of the trading year, [PLTR stock has risen 54%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr), making it the best performer in the S&P 500.

Over the past 12 months, Palantir’s share price has now gained 365%.

The continued rise in PLTR stock comes despite widespread criticism on Wall Street, where analysts warn that the shares are [too richly valued](https://www.tipranks.com/news/citigroup-slaps-hold-rating-on-palantir-pltr-stock-after-blowout-earnings), trading at more than 600 times future earnings estimates. Palantir’s stock is also rising on hype surrounding [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) (AI) that could provide a further boost to the company’s business, which is primarily focused on government and defense contracts.

**Cult-Like Following**
-----------------------

Some analysts have gone so far as to say that PLTR stock has developed a cult-like following among retail investors who are ignoring the fundamentals behind the share price. At the same time, Palantir’s stock has attracted growing interest from short sellers, who are placing bets that the share price will decline from its current height.

Still, bullish investors point out that Palantir has surpassed consensus forecasts for its [financial results](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/palantir-technologies-reports-strong-u-s-growth-amid-ai-surge) over the last few quarters, forcing analysts to continuously raise their earnings estimates as a result.

**Is PLTR Stock a Buy?**

Palantir Technologies stock has a consensus Hold rating among 17 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on two Buy, 10 Hold, and five Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average PLTR price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr/forecast)of $88.60 implies 24.05% downside risk from current levels.
