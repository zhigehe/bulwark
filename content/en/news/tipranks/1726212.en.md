European payment powerhouse Klarna has decided to finally jump into the [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) scene. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski announced on X that they’re gearing up to integrate cryptocurrencies into their services. “I give up. Klarna and me will embrace crypto! More to come,” he declared. This is a significant shift for the firm valued at a hefty $14.8 billion. Klarna is a titan in the “buy now, pay later” sector but the company has resisted the crypto movement until now, making this decision all the more groundbreaking.

**Sequoia Capital Backs Klarna’s Bold Leap**
--------------------------------------------

Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital, holding a 22% stake in Klarna, is no stranger to the crypto sphere, with investments in Avalanche (**[AVAX-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/avax-usd)**) and Stripe. This backing from Sequoia, noted for championing fintech innovation, adds an extra layer of confidence in Klarna’s new venture. Siemiatkowski told his 33,000 followers on X that Klarna is the “last large fintech in the world to embrace it. Someone had to be last.”

**What’s Next for Klarna and Crypto?**
--------------------------------------

While details are still under wraps, the community is speculating on how Klarna will integrate crypto. From a potential “buy crypto, pay later” model—quickly dismissed by Siemiatkowski—to other innovative integrations, Klarna is exploring all avenues. “It might take some time for us to have a plan in place,” he noted earlier today.
