[Technology giant Microsoft](https://www.tipranks.com/news/msft-earnings-microsoft-stock-falls-on-weak-cloud-computing-growth) [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) is transferring its $22-billion-dollar augmented reality headset program with the U.S. Army to defense-tech startup Anduril Industries.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.

The partnership still needs approval from the U.S. Department of Defense. If approved, Anduril will oversee “production, future development of hardware and software, and delivery timelines” for the U.S. Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System program, the companies said in a written statement.

The headset program is intended to improve capabilities such as night vision for U.S. Army soldiers. Microsoft won a 10-year contract worth $22 billion to build more than 120,000 custom HoloLens headsets for the Army back in 2021 but the company discontinued production of the device last year.

Now it looks like the headset program is being revived with Anduril as the lead contractor. However, [Microsoft will continue](https://www.tipranks.com/news/time-to-sell-the-magnificent-seven-stocks-says-goldman-sachs-gs) to provide cloud and [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) capabilities for the project.

**Big Win for Anduril**
-----------------------

The U.S. Army contract comes at a key time for Anduril. The startup company has been in negotiations aimed at raising up to $2.5 billion in funding at a $28 billion valuation. Anduril also has a partnership with OpenAI and is building a manufacturing facility in Ohio.

Since its founding in 2017, Anduril has been working to muscle its way into the defense contractor space that is dominated by heavyweight companies such as Lockheed Martin [(LMT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lmt) and Northrop Grumman [(NOC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/noc). Anduril’s founder Palmer Luckey previously sold the Oculus virtual-reality (VR) headset startup to Meta Platforms [(META)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta) for $2 billion.

[MSFT stock is flat](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) over the past 12 months.

**Is MSFT Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

Microsoft’s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 32 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 29 Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average price target on MSFT stock](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast) of $510.90 implies 24.18% upside from current levels.
