10X Genomics ([TXG](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/txg/forecast)) has disclosed a new risk, in the Technology category.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.
* Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  [Your Smart Portfolio](https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings)

10X Genomics faces a significant business risk due to the complexity of data generated by its products, which requires advanced analytics for effective interpretation. Customers lacking bioinformatics expertise or computational resources may struggle to derive actionable insights, potentially delaying further use or diminishing the perceived value of the products. The company might incur increased operational costs by providing extensive training and support, yet there’s no guarantee of customer proficiency in data analysis. Such challenges could negatively impact customer satisfaction, slow product adoption, and adversely affect 10X Genomics’ financial outcomes.

The average TXG [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/txg/forecast) is $17.27, implying 44.64% upside potential.
