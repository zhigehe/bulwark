In fact, *Investing.com* reported that Citi has nudged its short-term target for gold to $3,000 per ounce, a jump from the previous $2,800. This price target has been fueled by growing concerns over international trade disputes.

**Crypto Gold Gains Ground**
----------------------------

Not to be outdone by their tangible counterparts, gold-backed digital tokens like PAXG and XAUT are enjoying their moment in the sun. As real gold prices inflate, these digital assets, tethered to physical gold stored securely in vaults, are performing impressively. Amidst market uncertainty, investors are increasingly turning to these hybrid investments that combine the reliability of gold with the flexibility of cryptocurrency.

**The Safe-Haven Asset Shines**
-------------------------------

With the U.S. and China locking horns over trade policies, gold’s allure as a safe-haven asset is shining brighter than ever. According to *Reuters*, spot gold climbed to $2,861.46 per ounce, marking a sixth week of gains. “The central focus of the gold market continues to be the uncertainty in regard to the [Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) tariff policies,” said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. This sentiment is echoed across financial strategies, as investors flock to gold, seeking security against the stormy backdrop of international trade disputes.

Despite a robust U.S. job market, with the Labor Department reporting 143,000 new jobs in January, uncertainties around trade tariffs and their impact on economic policies keep investors nervous and gold attractive. As the Federal Reserve grapples with these mixed signals, the future of gold looks not just bright, but golden.
