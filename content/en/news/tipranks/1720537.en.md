Mynaric AG ( [(DE:M0YN)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/de:m0yn) ) has shared an update.

On February 7, 2025, Mynaric AG announced the acquisition of a fourth bridge loan worth USD 28 million and an extension of three existing bridge loans, along with a new restructuring loan of USD 25 million to support their ongoing operations and production plan. The company is undergoing financial restructuring under the German StaRUG framework, with plans to significantly reduce its debt by waiving existing term loans and bridge loans. This restructuring might lead to a full delisting of Mynaric and a capital reduction to zero, followed by a capital increase, potentially resulting in the loss of all investments by current shareholders. The restructuring is crucial to prevent insolvency due to the company’s over-indebtedness and lack of refinancing options.
