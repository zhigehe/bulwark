Tradeweb Markets faces significant risks associated with its substantial investments in [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) and blockchain technologies, which are costly and complex in nature. As these technologies are still in the early stages of commercial use, there is a lack of assurance regarding market acceptance or enhancement of their products or services. Moreover, the company may encounter various risks, including ethical concerns, reliability issues, and increased regulatory scrutiny, which could adversely impact its business reputation and operational results. Additionally, evolving legal frameworks and superior competitor offerings further exacerbate these risks, making it challenging to predict all potential legal and operational implications.

The average TW [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tw/forecast) is $143.40, implying 15.32% upside potential.
