**Tech Titans Battle it Out**
-----------------------------

The backstory is as tangled as the technologies they develop. Altman and Musk, who helped launch OpenAI together in 2015, have since diverged sharply in their visions for the company. While Altman pushes for a profitable model, Musk advocates a return to non-profit roots. He emphasizes open-source and safety. Their feud escalated into legal threats, with Musk suing over alleged deviations from their non-profit commitment. However, he later withdrew the suit after some of his compromising emails surfaced.

Musk’s attempt to reclaim control via a monumental bid—backed by his AI company xAI and other investment heavyweights—highlights the intense struggle over the direction of AI development. Marc Toberoff, Musk’s lawyer, asserts, “If OpenAI Inc. goes fully for-profit, it’s crucial that the charity is fairly compensated.” Meanwhile, OpenAI, with a recent valuation soaring to $260 billion, continues to attract massive investments.
