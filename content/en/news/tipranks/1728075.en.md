Bengal Energy ( [(TSE:BNG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:bng) ) has provided an announcement.

Bengal Energy reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, noting a decrease in crude oil sales revenue by 11% compared to the previous year, largely due to a reduction in oil lifted volumes. Despite lower sales, the company managed to reduce its net loss from the previous year, aided by decreased royalties, operating expenses, and general and administrative costs. Production volumes also saw a significant drop, leading to Bengal investigating changes in production allocation by the Cuisinier operator. The company has delayed capital expenditures, contingent on securing financing.
