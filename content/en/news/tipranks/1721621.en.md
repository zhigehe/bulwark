The past two weeks have been eventful, to say the least. Stocks opened sharply lower to start the week, following earlier Trump’s announcement of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Together, these three economies account for over 40% of total U.S. trade. Stocks later regained ground amid the temporary rollback of the levies on Mexico and Canada.

Although China was not spared – and also announced reciprocal levies on U.S. goods – tariff concerns eased until Friday, when President Trump’s announcement of plans to implement reciprocal tariffs on various countries reignited market jitters. However, this also isn’t set in stone, as the European Union has already said it is considering lowering tariffs on car imports from the U.S.

In other key news, companies are acceleratingly ramping up their capex. Alphabet [(GOOGL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl), Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft), Amazon [(AMZN)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn), and Meta Platforms [(META)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta) project an annual capex increase of more than 45%. Other technology companies are scaling their spending plans. Furthermore, firms across the Industrial, Materials, and Utilities sectors are also ramping up investments in capacity expansion, driven by accelerating demand from hyperscalers’ data-center build-out.

The elevated corporate capex spending points to upside risks to economic growth and hiring. While recent economic reports were mixed, they still reflect a robust economy and elevated inflation. Moreover, after expanding by 2.8% in 2024, the GDP is on track to deliver a strong 2.9% growth rate in Q1 2025, according to the Fed’s GDP-Now tracker. This growth rate is well above the long-term trend, supporting the case for the Federal Reserve to remain on hold with rate cuts for now.

**Three** ****Economic Events****
---------------------------------

Here are three economic events that could affect your portfolio this week. For a full listing of additional economic events, check out the [TipRanks Economic Calendar](https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic).

**» January’s [CPI](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate)** and **CPI ex. Food and Energy (Core CPI)** – Wednesday, 02/12 – The CPI report is one of the two key indicators used to measure [inflation](https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate) (the second one is the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE). Policymakers, businesses, and consumers closely watch the CPI report, as it reflects the price trends in the economy, shapes consumer spending and business outlook, and directly affects the Federal Reserve’s policy rate decisions.

**» January’s Producer Price Index (PPI)** and **PPI ex. Food and Energy** – Thursday, 02/13 – This report reflects input prices for producers and manufacturers. Since PPI measures the costs of producing consumer goods – directly affecting retail pricing – PPI is seen as a telling signal of inflationary pressures. This makes it a leading indicator for the following month’s CPI. Thus, the PPI directly impacts the overall inflation outlook among policymakers.

**» January’s Retail Sales** – Friday, 02/14 – This report provides information on the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods. Retail Sales is a leading indicator of the economy’s health, providing an outlook into the current quarter’s economic growth as well as into the inflationary factors on the demand side.
