USDC has added $10 billion to its market cap over the last 30 days, driven largely by rising Solana-based DeFi trading volumes. USDC’s growth has been more than double the $4.6 billion rise in the market cap of Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin and Circle’s chief rival, during the same period.

Tether still dominates the stablecoin market with a market cap of $142 billion. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose price is tied to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar or gold bullion. Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC are widely used for [trading on](https://www.tipranks.com/news/goldman-sachs-ramps-up-crypto-investments-with-2000-boost-in-ether-etfs) [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) exchanges and serve as a key source of liquidity for the marketplace.

**Growing Crypto Demand**
-------------------------

The growth of Circle’s USDC stablecoin is a sign of [expanding demand](https://www.tipranks.com/news/ethereum-could-blast-toward-3k-on-rocket-like-rebound) for cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) [(BTC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/btc) and [Ethereum](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd) [(ETH)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/eth), say analysts. And the growth of USDT and USDC has accelerated in recent weeks.

The gains have coincided with the [frenetic trading of Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/news/bitcoins-btc-energy-consumption-drops-from-all-time-high) and other cryptos, both buying and selling. Analysts say accelerating stablecoin growth is a bullish sign for the overall crypto market and positions it for continued gains. BTC has risen 88% over the last 12 months.

**Is BTC a Buy?**
-----------------

Most Wall Street firms don’t offer ratings or price targets on Bitcoin, so we’ll look at the cryptocurrency’s [three-month performance](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) instead. As one can see in the chart below, the price of BTC has risen 11.63% in the last 12 weeks.
