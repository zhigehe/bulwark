IONQ agreed a partnership with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) to bring the “power of quantum computing to government and defense sectors,” the company said in release Monday.

**IONQ and GD Build on Partnership**
------------------------------------

Earlier this year IONQ and GDIT partnered with a major intelligence agency to advance its quantum readiness.

Now the pair plan to combine GDIT’s expertise in working with federal agencies and the defense sector with IONQ’s quantum computing tech to grow the reach of its technology within government.

It will see the two companies co-develop advanced quantum processing and networking applications, including quantum [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) extensions, resource optimization, and anomaly detection for federal and state governments, they said.

The deal will “accelerate quantum computing adoption in the government, continuing IonQ’s consistent market growth,” said Rima Alameddine, IONQ Chief Revenue Officer.

Ben Gianni, senior vice president and chief technology office at GDIT, said that expanding the partnership will enable the company to harness the next generation of computational power to “address critical mission needs.”

**Analysts Raise Outlook on IONQ**
----------------------------------

Last year IONQ announced a $54.5 million contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), which marked the largest 2024 quantum contract award in the U.S.

Increasing awareness of the potential for quantum computing has not only got the attention of government agencies, but investors too.

It comes after [Needham analyst Quinn Bolton](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/quinn-bolton) raised price target on IONQ to $54 from $18 last month, citing how quantum computing may disrupt a meaningful portion of the $1 trillion computing market over the next decade.
