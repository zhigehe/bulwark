It is important to highlight that SMCI’s accounting troubles have persisted for months. After the delay in the filing of financial reports, Nasdaq warned it must submit financials by February 25 or face delisting. With growing regulatory pressure, the key question is whether SMCI can overcome these challenges, deliver strong earnings, and sustain its share price rally.

**Analysts’ Views on SMCI Ahead of Q2 Results**
-----------------------------------------------

Ahead of SMCI’s Q2 results, [Loop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/ananda-baruah) has increased its price target for Super Micro from $35 to $40 while maintaining a Buy rating. The five-star analyst considers SMCI an “important company in an important space,” benefiting from growth drivers, such as resolving its SEC filing delays, and strong fundamentals. The firm cited the anticipated ramp-up of Nvidia’s (NVDA) next-generation Blackwell AI chips as a notable catalyst that could further accelerate Super Micro’s growth.

Analyst Baruah highlighted that Super Micro Computer’s two largest customers have ambitious plans for 2025, which should significantly benefit SMCI. One key example is CoreWeave, which plans to double its data centers from 30 at the end of 2024 to 60 in 2025.

Meanwhile, a few other analysts remain skeptical about SMCI stock due to multiple uncertainties, including the timely filing of financial reports and continued listing on Nasdaq. In December, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Wedbush reiterated a Hold rating on Super Micro stock.

**Options Traders Anticipate a Large Move**

**Is SMCI** **Stock a Buy?**
----------------------------

The stock of Super Micro Computer has a consensus Hold rating among five Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on one Buy, three Holds, and one Sell recommendation issued in the past three months. The [average SMCI price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast) of $29.75 implies an 18% downside risk from current levels.
