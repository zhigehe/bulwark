Aptiv PLC ([APTV](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aptv/forecast)) has disclosed a new risk, in the Corporate Activity and Growth category.

Aptiv PLC is facing significant business risk as it plans to separate its Electrical Distribution Systems business into an independent, publicly traded company. The complexity of the proposed spin-off and its dependency on satisfying various conditions could lead to unforeseen delays or abandonment, potentially undermining the intended strategic and financial benefits. Moreover, the newly formed companies may be more susceptible to market fluctuations due to their reduced size and focus, and the expected tax-free nature of the transaction may not materialize. The process demands extensive resources and management attention, risking negative market reactions and financial impacts if the spin-off is not executed efficiently.

The average APTV [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aptv/forecast) is $82.07, implying 28.03% upside potential.
