The Oregon-based company delivered another in a series of [impressive prints](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/dutch-bros-inc-achieves-robust-growth-in-2024), announcing earnings per share (EPS) of $0.07 on revenue of $343 million. That topped earnings of $0.02 and sales of $318 million that was expected on Wall Street.

At the same time, Dutch Bros guided for full-year 2025 revenue of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion and same store sales growth of 4%. The guidance also exceeded analysts’ consensus expectations, sending the stock up sharply higher in today’s trading (Feb. 13).

**Red Hot Stock**
-----------------

[BROS stock has now risen 208%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bros) in the last 12 months. The company has a unique business model in that it only operates drive-through coffee locations. A going concern since 1992, the company primarily operates in the western U.S., mostly in its home state of Oregon, as well as neighboring California.

However, Dutch Bros. is expanding, having recently opened a new location in Florida. Analysts say the continued expansion should help Dutch Bros. earnings in coming quarters. Dutch Bros. is one of several coffee chains to report strong financial results, with Starbucks [(SBUX)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sbux) and Restaurant Brands International [(QSR)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qsr), parent of Canada’s Tim Hortons, also reporting solid prints.

**Is BROS Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

The stock of Dutch Bros. has a consensus Strong Buy rating among nine Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on nine Buy recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average BROS price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bros/forecast) of $72.11 implies 13.80% downside from current levels. However, these ratings are likely to change after the company’s financial results.
