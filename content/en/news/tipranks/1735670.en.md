**Regulatory Hurdles Mount, but SMCI Races to Avoid Nasdaq Delisting**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The company remains under pressure as it faces potential Nasdaq ([**NDX**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)) delisting for failing to file its annual report and Q1 earnings on time. Auditor Ernst & Young’s resignation over financial reporting concerns has further complicated matters.

However, SMCI’s management reassured investors that an internal probe found no fraud, and it is actively working with regulators to resolve the situation. The company expects to complete its FY24 audit by the February 25th filing extension deadline granted by Nasdaq. That should prevent the stock’s dreaded delisting.

**SMCI Provides Bold FY26 Revenue Projections**
-----------------------------------------------

SMCI’s aggressive growth forecast for FY26 stole the spotlight, overshadowing concerns about potential Nasdaq delisting.

Looking ahead, SMCI has revised its fiscal 2025 revenue forecast to a range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion, down from the earlier estimate of $26 billion to $30 billion. However, the company projects a significant leap in fiscal 2026, targeting $40 billion in revenue, surpassing current analyst projections of $29.2 billion.

This outlook is attributed to anticipated demand for data center infrastructure solutions.

**Analysts Bet** **on AI-Driven Growth****, Raise Price Targets**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

While SMCI lowered its FY25 revenue guidance, the optimistic FY26 outlook and the company’s dominance in AI-driven server solutions have driven analysts to revise their targets upward:

* **Wedbush:** Maintained a Neutral rating but acknowledged the potential for higher [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) server demand and thereby increased the price target to $40.00 from $24.00 per share.
* **Loop Capital:** Raised its price target to $50 from $40, maintaining a Buy rating. He believes SMCI’s AI-driven demand and industry positioning make upside inevitable.
* **JPMorgan:** Raised its price target to $35 from $23, [though it remains cautious about execution risks](https://www.tipranks.com/news/hold-your-enthusiasm-for-now-says-j-p-morgan-about-super-micro-computer-stock).
* **Needham:** Expressed skepticism but recognized long-term upside, predicting a more conservative $35 billion in revenue.

Despite regulatory setbacks, analysts see promise in Super Micro’s AI-driven growth. With rising price targets and ambitious revenue forecasts, SMCI’s momentum stays strong.

**Is SMCI a Good Buy?**
-----------------------

Overall, Wall Street prefers to remain on the sidelines on SMCI stock until it resolves compliance issues. On TipRanks, SMCI stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on three Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating. The [average Super Micro Computer price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast) of $38.40 implies 3.23% downside potential from current levels.
