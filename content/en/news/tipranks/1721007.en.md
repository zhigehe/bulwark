The latest update is out from Oncolytics Biotech ( [(TSE:ONC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:onc) ).

Oncolytics Biotech Inc. announced that Matt Coffey, Ph.D., will not return to his role as CEO after a medical leave of absence due to ongoing health concerns. Dr. Coffey’s decision was made with the best interests of his family and the company in mind. He has played a pivotal role in the development of pelareorep, an innovative therapeutic agent for cancer treatment, from its pre-clinical stages to Phase 2 studies. Wayne Pisano, the Chair of Oncolytics’ Board of Directors, will serve as interim CEO while the company searches for a new CEO to continue advancing Coffey’s vision. This leadership transition may impact Oncolytics’ strategic direction as it seeks to further its position in the oncology immunotherapy sector.
