Northwestern ([NWE](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nwe/forecast)) has disclosed a new risk, in the Accounting & Financial Operations category.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.

Northwestern faces a significant risk due to its reliance on a holding company structure, where the company’s primary assets are investments in its subsidiaries, NW Corp and NWE Public Service. Since substantially all operations occur within these subsidiaries, Northwestern depends heavily on their earnings, cash flows, and dividends to pay dividends on its common stock. Regulatory, contractual, and legal limitations, along with capital requirements of the subsidiaries, could impede their ability to distribute dividends to the parent company. This restriction could adversely affect Northwestern’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, potentially impacting its stock price negatively.

The average NWE [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nwe/forecast) is $58.58, implying 10.80% upside potential.
