Embraer SA ( [(ERJ)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/erj) ) just unveiled an announcement.

In February 2025, Embraer S.A., together with Embraer Netherlands Finance B.V., entered into an indenture agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, serving in multiple roles including trustee and paying agent. This agreement involved the issuance of 5.980% notes due in 2035, reflecting Embraer’s strategic move to secure financing and potentially strengthen its financial position. The involvement of prominent law firms offering opinions on matters of Brazilian, New York, and Dutch law indicates a robust legal framework supporting the transaction, which could enhance investor confidence and further solidify Embraer’s position in the aerospace industry.
