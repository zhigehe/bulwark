DH Enchantment Inc. has announced a delay in filing its Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) for the financial period ending December 31, 2024. The delay is primarily due to difficulties in obtaining and compiling the necessary information for the report, which could not be resolved without unreasonable effort and expense. The company anticipates that the Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) will be filed no later than the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date. Importantly, the company does not expect any significant changes in financial results from the same period last year. DH Enchantment continues to work towards compliance and the notification is signed by Cheuk Yin Cheung, CEO, CFO, and Secretary.
