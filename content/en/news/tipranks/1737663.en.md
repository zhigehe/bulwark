Sino Green Land Corporation has announced a delay in filing its Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) for the financial period ending December 31, 2024. The delay is primarily due to the additional time needed to compile and analyze supporting documentation and to allow the company’s independent registered public accounting firm to complete its review of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The company anticipates that the report will be filed no later than five calendar days after its original due date. The company does not expect any significant changes in its financial results compared to the same period last year, and it is committed to maintaining compliance with filing requirements. The notification was signed by Wo Kuk Ching, the Chief Executive Officer.
