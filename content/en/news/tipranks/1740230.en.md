**BigBear.[ai](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) (**[**NYSE:BBAI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bbai/forecast)**)** stock is either at the beginning of a compelling growth story or teetering on the edge of a massive bubble, depending on whom you ask.

The past few months have delivered plenty of fodder for those bullish on BBAI’s prospects. The AI analytics company has recently won a deal to support the U.S. Department of Defense in conducting risk assessments of foreign adversaries and secured a prime contract with the U.S. Navy.

In addition, President Trump’s recent removal of Biden-era AI guardrails could further open up the floodgates for BBAI to sell its wares to the U.S. government.

Meanwhile, BBAI shares have more than doubled in 2025, and are up an astonishing 664% over the past 6 months. Not surprisingly, retail investors, who own over 60% of all BBAI shares, are clearly clambering to get in on the action.

However, one top investor, known by the pseudonym JR Research, urges would-be investors to rethink this approach.

“I don’t think now is the time to go long on a stock that’s exhibiting signs of a bearish top while still trying to validate its business model,” cautions JR, who sits in the top 1% of TipRanks’ stock pros.

The skepticism isn’t unfounded. BBAI’s projected revenue growth for 2024 is under 10% – far from the frenzied exuberance of the stock price. And looking ahead to 2025, JR sees growth as “muted” compared to industry-leading **Palantir ([NASDAQ:PLTR](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr/forecast))**.

JR doubles down on this point, questioning whether BBAI will be able to succeed in replicating Palantir’s incredible run.

“We must be careful when ‘parlaying’ Palantir’s success into BBAI and expect the fledgling AI stock to post similar metrics to the Alex Karp-led company,” notes JR, referencing Palantir’s celebrated CEO.

Valuation is another concern. BBAI’s Forward Price/Sales ratio of 11.7x is more than 200% above the sector median, raising questions about whether the stock price is outpacing reality.

“I urge holders to consider taking profits and reallocate,” concludes JR Research, assigning a Sell rating for BBAI shares. (To watch JR Research’s track record, [click here](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/jr-research))

Despite its roaring bull run, BBAI has not attracted much attention on Wall Street. With only 2 Buy ratings, BBAI claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, its 12-month average price target of $7.50 has overshot even these optimistic assessments, and implies a downside of 23%.

The real question now is whether analysts will revise their price targets higher or start dialing back their enthusiasm in the months ahead. (See [**BBAI stock forecast**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bbai/forecast))
