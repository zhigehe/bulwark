First Quantum Minerals Ltd. is a Canada-based mining company involved in the production of copper, nickel, and gold, with operations in Zambia, Türkiye, Mauritania, and other locations. The company recently faced challenges with its Cobre Panamá and Ravensthorpe mines which were placed into preservation and maintenance phases. The latest financial results for the year ending December 31, 2024, revealed a net loss of $108 million despite a gross profit of $1,350 million, indicating operational hurdles and impairment charges impacting profitability. The company’s revenue decreased significantly to $4,802 million from $6,456 million in the previous year, mainly due to lower sales volumes and pricing pressures. Despite these challenges, First Quantum managed to reduce its net loss, improve operating profit to $810 million, and raise $1,103 million through share issuance, enhancing its liquidity position. Looking ahead, First Quantum remains focused on optimizing its existing operations and exploring potential growth opportunities, as management aims to navigate the current market conditions and improve financial stability.
