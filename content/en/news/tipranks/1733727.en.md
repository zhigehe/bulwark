Adobe’s new “Firefly Video Model” will compete directly against Sora, a model developed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Both the Firefly and Sora [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) video tools enable users to [generate videos](https://www.tipranks.com/news/is-adbe-stock-dip-justified-examining-market-fears-and-competitive-pressures) by providing commands to an AI model.

Video generation is one of the hot new areas of AI. Meta Platforms [(META)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta) has announced that it too is developing a video-generation AI application, though it has not yet been released to the public. In a news release, Adobe said its AI video generator is unique in that it can create professional TV quality video clips.

**Pricing and Quality**
-----------------------

Adobe adds that its new AI video generator is compatible with its Premiere Pro video editing software. The new AI model can also create video clips in high resolution 1080p.

[The pricing](https://www.tipranks.com/news/after-a-disappointing-year-adobe-could-be-due-for-a-recovery) for Adobe’s new Firefly Video Model allows users to generate 20 video clips per month for $9.99, and 70 clips for $29.99. This compares to OpenAI, which offers 50 video clips for $20 a month at a lower resolution, and a $200 plan for longer, high-resolution video segments.
