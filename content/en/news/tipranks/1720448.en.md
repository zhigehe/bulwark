The stock sales by [Amazon](https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-expected-to-unveil-new-alexa-device-at-feb-26-hardware-event) CEO Andy Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai were disclosed in year-end regulatory filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings show that Jassy plans to sell over $19 million of AMZN stock. Pichai’s sales are much more dramatic.

Through the Pichai Family Foundation, the Alphabet CEO plans to sell 876,000 class C shares of the company he runs. Based on the current price of [GOOGL stock](https://www.tipranks.com/news/alphabet-googl-dumps-entire-stake-in-snowflake-stock), Pichai’s sale is valued at about $169 million. However, Pichai’s stock sale is scheduled to occur between April of this year and April 2026.

**Difficult Earnings Reports**
------------------------------

News of the share sales come days after both Amazon and Alphabet reported [mixed financial results](https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-earnings-amazon-beats-wall-street-forecasts-but-issues-weak-guidance) for the fourth-quarter of 2024, sending the company’s share prices lower as a result. [GOOGL stock fell 7%](https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-earnings-alphabet-stock-falls-7-on-revenue-miss) the day after the company’s latest earnings report, while AMZN stock declined 4% after its print.

According to documents filed with the SEC, Jassy still owns 2,087,710 Amazon shares through personal accounts and a trust. Those holdings are worth $478.08 million. Pichai’s still owns 2,713,044 class C shares [(GOOG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog) and 227,560 class A shares in personal accounts. Those holdings are worth $550.16 million.

**Is GOOGL Stock a Buy?**
-------------------------

The stock of Alphabet has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 36 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 26 Buy and 10 Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The [average GOOGL price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/forecast) of $215.73 implies 16.31% upside from current levels.
