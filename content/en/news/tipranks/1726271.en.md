Rockwell Automation ([ROK](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rok/forecast)) has disclosed a new risk, in the Capital Markets category.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.
* Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  [Your Smart Portfolio](https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings)

Rockwell Automation’s profitability and market competitiveness are at risk due to potential changes in trade policies, such as new or increased tariffs between countries like the United States, Mexico, Canada, and China. These changes could lead to higher manufacturing and supply chain costs, supply chain disruptions, and increased operational complexity. Despite efforts to mitigate these impacts, their ability to recover cost increases may be limited by competitive pressures and customer acceptance. As a result, these factors could adversely affect their business and financial results.

The average ROK [stock price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rok/forecast) is $306.18, implying 1.27% upside potential.
