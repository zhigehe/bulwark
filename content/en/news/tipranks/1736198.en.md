The latest announcement is out from Ondo InsurTech Plc ( [(GB:ONDO)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:ondo) ).

Ondo InsurTech Plc reported strong growth driven by the adoption of its LeakBot technology, particularly in the U.S., with a notable increase in registered customers and revenue projections. The company secured a major contract with Liberty Mutual, contributing to its successful U.S. expansion. A robust contract model has improved Ondo’s working capital profile, enabling prepayments on initial rollouts. While growth in Denmark and the UK is robust, Sweden’s rollout has slowed due to partner assessments. Ondo remains on track to achieve EBITDA positive trading in H2 FY 2026.
