A stock split is a financial move when a company issues more shares to its existing shareholders while reducing the price per share. Consequently, the total value of the investment remains the same for a shareholder. Similarly, the overall market capitalization of the company remains the same both before and after the split.

The primary purpose of a [stock split](https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/stock-splits/upcoming) is to enhance liquidity and make the stock more affordable for investors.

On the other hand, in a reverse stock split, a company reduces the total number of outstanding shares by consolidating them. Despite this reduction, the company’s market capitalization remains unchanged because the share price increases proportionally to balance the consolidation. It is also known as stock consolidation and is often used to boost the stock price, which can help meet listing requirements or improve the stock’s perception in the market.

Let’s take a quick look at the upcoming stock splits in Australia for this week.
