**Analysts’ Opinions Ahead of ABNB’s Q4 Results**
-------------------------------------------------

Heading into Q4 results, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a Hold rating on Airbnb stock with a price target of $155. The five-star analyst stated that based on industry data points, third-party channel checks, and peer Expedia’s [(EXPE)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/expe) strong Q4 results, he expects Airbnb to deliver a “Beat and Bracket Q4:24.” However, he cautioned that currency headwinds could limit the upside to the Q1 guidance.

Mahaney added that the Street’s Q1 2025 year-over-year booking growth guidance of 10% and revenue growth outlook of 8% look reasonable, though any possible variance to the downside could occur due to forex headwinds, the extra day in 2024 (leap year), and Easter timing as highlighted by Expedia.

Meanwhile, UBS analyst Stephen Ju increased the price target for Airbnb stock to $143 from $142 but maintained a Hold rating. While the analyst sees the possibility for an upside on Q4 results across the major online travel players, he is cautious due to forex headwinds, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against global currencies. For Airbnb, Ju continues to await signals indicating reaccelerating volume growth or greater monetization on various value-added services.
