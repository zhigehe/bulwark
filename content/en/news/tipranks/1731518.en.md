Japanese tech investor SoftBank [(SFTBF)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sftbf) swung to a $2.4 billion loss in the quarter ended December as valuations at its Vision Fund fell, fueling questions about its ability to raise $500 billion for the Stargate [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) scheme.

SFTBF booked losses on its investments in South Korean e-commerce platform Coupang [(CPNG)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cpng), Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global [(DIDIY)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/didiy) and Norway-based AutoStore Holdings. Among the hundreds of unlisted companies still on the books is ByteDance, the TiKTok owner.

The losses come as SoftBank finalizes a $40 billion primary investment in OpenAI at a $260 billion valuation for the ChatGPT company. It’s thought that some of the investment will be funnelled to Stargate, the joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle [(ORCL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/orcl) as boss Masayoshi Son shifts his big bet away from the Vision Fund to building major stakes in [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) technologies.

Last valued at $157 billion in October, the SFTBF investment would see the Japanese company overtake Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) as the top investor in OpenAI. Meanwhile, SoftBank recently committed to spending $3 billion per year for itself and subsidiaries to use OpenAI’s tech.

**Losses Pose Questions for SFTBF**
-----------------------------------

SoftBank lost ¥369.2 billion ($2.4 billion) for its Fiscal third quarter versus a profit of ¥950 billion a year ago as the core Vision Fund unit posted a ¥309.9 billion loss.

While investors may be used to changing quarterly performances, losses from the perennially volatile Vision funds could hamper Son’s plans to use project finance to fund the initiative. Project financing can help reduce the need to divest assets, however it could raise already substantial debt payments. SFTBF interest expenses rose ¥29 billion in the first nine months of its Fiscal year to ¥331 billion.

**SoftBank Makes UK AI Investments**
------------------------------------

SoftBank has been making numerous investments in AI technology companies, including at least two big calls in the UK.

Alongside Microsoft and Nvidia [(NVDA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda) it invested in Wayve Technologies, a British company developing autonomous driving platforms based on data learning using AI. Last year also saw SFTBF announce investment in the UK’s Graphcore, a designer and developer of [semiconductor](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks) chips specialized for AI and machine learning, which it also converted it to a subsidiary.

**Is SoftBank a Good Stock to Buy?**
------------------------------------

Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy rating on SFTBF stock, based on three Buys and three Holds among the six analysts to offer 12-month price targets in the last three months. The [average SFTBF price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sftbf/forecast) of $79.30 implies nearly 27% upside.
