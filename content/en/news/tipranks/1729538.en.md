Genesis Energy, alongside New Zealand’s largest electricity generators, is exploring options to ensure national energy security in response to recent energy supply challenges. They have entered into a non-binding agreement to consider extending the operational life of Huntly Power Station’s Rankine Units to manage dry-year risks and enhance system security amid increasing reliance on intermittent renewable sources. This initiative may include creating a strategic fuel reserve and extending existing firming options, with potential arrangements expected by 2026, pending regulatory approval.
