The latest announcement is out from AFR NuVenture Resources Inc ( [(TSE:AFR)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:afr) ).

AFR NuVenture Resources Inc. has announced its signing of a letter of intent to acquire a 100% interest in the Massey Nickel Project, located in the Timmins Mining Camp in Ontario. This project, covering approximately 2000 hectares, is identified as a promising exploration opportunity with drill-ready targets, supported by recent geological findings of gabbro host rock and VTEM anomalies. The strategic acquisition positions AFR NuVenture Resources Inc. to capitalize on the mineralized potential of the Kamiskotia Complex, drawing parallels to historically significant nickel-copper-cobalt deposits in Lynn Lake, Manitoba.
