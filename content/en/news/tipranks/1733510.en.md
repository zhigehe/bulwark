Alphabet [(GOOGL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl) is joining with OpenAI investor SoftBank [(SFTBF)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sftbf) to back [quantum computing](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/quantum-computing) startup QuEra, as part of a $230 million funding round.

### Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:

* Leverage the power of [TipRanks' Smart Score](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks), a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.
* Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  [Your Smart Portfolio](https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings)

The startup, a 2018 MIT spinoff, has previously been valued at up to $1 billion and the latest funding round underlines how investors are warming up to quantum computing technology.

QuEra said the funds will be used to accelerate the development and production of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers which can be used at room temperature, unlike other quantum tech.

“We believe quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries, and QuEra is at the forefront of making this technology accessible and transformative,” said Kentaro Matsui, Managing Partner of SoftBank Investment Advisers.

It comes as Japan’s [SoftBank finalizes a $40 billion primary investment in OpenAI](https://www.tipranks.com/news/openai-investor-softbank-sftbf-tumbles-to-2-4b-loss-before-stargate-launch) at a $260 billion valuation for the ChatGPT company. Some of the investment will be funnelled to Stargate, the joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle [(ORCL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/orcl) as boss Masayoshi Son places a major bet on building controlling stakes in [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) technologies and companies. Quantum computing is often seen as complementary to AI since it could help meet the challenges presented by AI both in terms of energy use and computing power.

Ed Durkin, CFO of QuEra, said Google and SoftBank share the long-term vision of the business.

“This funding structure, coupled with our growing organic revenue stream, provides flexibility as we hit our development targets and scale production and provides the Company with a very long financial runway over the next several years,” he added.

-----------------------------------------

QuEra is not the only quantum computing generating attention. Companies like IonQ [(IONQ)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq) D-Wave Quantum [(QBTS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts) Quantum Computing [(QUBT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qubt), and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) have seen huge investor interest since rallying sharply at the end of 2024 after Google announced it had completed a 100-qubit chip, marking the second phase of its strategy to build a quantum system with one million qubits.

But things have been rockier for the sector since. Nvidia [(NVDA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda) CEO Jensen Huang knocked quantum computing stocks by saying the technology’s practical use was 20 years away, while Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said quantum computing is “quite a ways off” from being a “practical paradigm.”

Nevertheless, NVDA announced its first Quantum Day to take place at GTC 2025 in March, while Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) declared 2025 “the year to become quantum-ready,” and unveiled a corporate training program.
