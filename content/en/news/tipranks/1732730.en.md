Shares of GME rallied Monday after Ryan Cohen, CEO of the video game retailer, posted a photo with Michael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MSTR, the largest corporate [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) holder, now simply rebranded as Strategy.

GME climbed over 7% on the session as investors bet that the photo implied some new strategy around cryptocurrencies for the company.

AMC Entertainment followed suit on Tuesday, with the stock rallying over 4% over the session and extending gains by almost 2% in premarket trading on Wednesday. Shares of GME fell back 2% on Tuesday.

**AMC More Than a Meme?**
-------------------------

But AMC stock’s rally could be more than just a read-across from the GME moves as meme stocks picked up some attention.

Yesterday, Cineplex hailed the return of audiences to movie theaters following the COVID-19 pandemic as it posted a 15% rise in revenues.

Toronto-based Cineplex [(TSE:CGX)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:cgx) said movie-goers are steadily returning, attracted by blockbuster movies such as *Gladiator II* and *Wicked*.

Meanwhile Disney [(DIS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dis) recently reported that *Moana 2*became its third 2024 release to top $1 billion in global box office sales, joining *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine* as audiences at last returned to theaters in meaningful numbers.

Total U.S. theater sales fell more than 3% to around $8.7 billion in 2024, though this was much better than feared earlier in the year and in large part driven by Disney’s blockbusters. Data from *Comscore* and *Deadline showed that* by the first weekend in May last year sales were down 20% on 2023 levels.

**AMC Bullish on Slate of Films**
---------------------------------

AMC reported Fiscal third quarter 2024 results last November that were a little down on the same quarter of the year before when *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* provided a tough compare.

CEO Adam Aron was elated though and talked up “the impressive movie slate that is coming to our theatres in November and December of 2024, and continuing in 2025 and again in 2026.”

He added, “Based on what we know now, we expect that the industry-wide box office should markedly rise at year-end and rise yet again for the next two years.”

AMC next reports earnings on February 27th, when investors will get a chance to see how much that impressive movie slate has delivered in terms box office sales.

**Is AMC a Good Stock to Buy?**
-------------------------------

Based on four Wall Street analysts providing a 12-month price target in the last three months, AMC is a consensus Hold. The [average AMC price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amc/forecast) of $3.63 implies about 10% upside.
