Goto ( [(IL:GOTO)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/il:goto) ) just unveiled an update.

Ayalon Mutual Funds Ltd has become an interested party in Goto following a private offering, acquiring 650,000 ordinary shares at 400 agorot each, resulting in a holding of 8.31% of capital and voting power, with potential full dilution holdings of 13.63%. This development allows Ayalon to potentially influence Goto’s strategic decisions, enhancing its market position and impacting stakeholders, as these securities were allocated for Dolphin and Pasternak-Shoham funds managed by Ayalon.
