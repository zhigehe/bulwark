GB Sciences, Inc. has announced a delay in filing its Form 10-Q (Quarter Report) for the financial period ending December 31, 2024. This delay is primarily due to the unexpected passing of the company’s principal financial and accounting officer, which has impacted the timely preparation of the report. The company did not specify an exact timeline for when the report will be filed but is working diligently to resolve these issues. Importantly, GB Sciences has indicated that there are no anticipated significant changes in its financial results.
