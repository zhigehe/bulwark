INmune Bio Inc. announced the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial for its CORDStrom platform, designed to treat Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB), a rare genetic skin disorder.

The company is preparing to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA by the end of 2025, aiming for potential approval and market launch in 2026, which could significantly impact their market positioning and offer a novel treatment option for this unmet medical need.
