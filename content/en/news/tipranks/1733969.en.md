The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved forward with several applications seeking to launch Solana [(SOL)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sol) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In a new regulatory filing, the Wall Street regulator opened a public commentary period on a proposed ETF from Canary Capital that would enable people to invest in a Solana ETF. The SEC has also acknowledged similar filings for spot Solana [ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/etf) from Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares and Bitwise.

The public comment period is to last 21 days, after which the SEC will render a verdict of approval or rejection on the [proposed SOL ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/news/franklin-templeton-pioneers-solana-etf-with-delaware-trust-registration). [Crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) analysts are cautiously optimistic that the Solana ETFs will be approved by the SEC, though the timing of their launch remains unclear.

**New Approach at SEC**
-----------------------

After years of [fighting greater adoption](https://www.tipranks.com/news/doge-shib-pepe-investors-lost-500-million-to-memecoin-scams-in-2024) of cryptocurrencies, the SEC now has a more favorable view of digital assets under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Canary and other asset managers are looking to list ETFs for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, XRP [(XRP)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xrp) and Cardano [(ADA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ada) that would have been rejected under the SEC previously.

Solana is one of the larger altcoins, which are defined as all cryptocurrencies other than [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) [(BTC)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/btc). Over the past 12 months, [Solana has risen 75%](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd) and currently trades at $194 per digital token. Many analysts anticipate that SOL will be the next crypto to have spot ETFs that track its price movements after BTC and [Ethereum](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd) [(ETH)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/eth) ETFs were given the greenlight from the SEC last year.

**Is SOL a Buy?**
-----------------

Most analysts don’t offer ratings or price targets on Solana. So instead, we’ll look at the [three-month price performance](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd) of the cryptocurrency. As you can see in the chart below, SOL’s price has declined 8% over the last 12 weeks.
