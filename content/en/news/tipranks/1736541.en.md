MediPress Health-Limited Partnership Partnership Units has reported a change in the holdings of securities by an interested party, Shmuel Kuzi, who is an Israeli citizen. The change involved an increase in securities due to a purchase on the stock exchange, resulting in a new holding percentage of 3.41% in both capital and voting power. This transaction was completed in one move at a price of 71 Agorot, and the company’s securities are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This adjustment in holdings may impact the company’s operations by potentially influencing its decision-making processes through the board of directors, given the right of the hedge fund to appoint a representative.
