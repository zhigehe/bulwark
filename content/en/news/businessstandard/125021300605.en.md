Carlyle Group has acquired controlling stakes in India’s Highway Industries and Roop Automotives, combining the two manufacturers to form a diversified global auto components platform, according to a company statement.
 
The deal, executed through Carlyle Asia Partners, reinforces the investment firm’s commitment to India’s advanced manufacturing sector. The transaction amount was not disclosed.
 
Highway and Roop manufacture forged and precision-machined components, steering assemblies, and powertrain parts for electric, hybrid, and internal combustion engine vehicles. The combined platform offers a portfolio of more than 1,500 products, a global clientele across 17 countries, and a network of 12 plants and 14 international warehouses. 
 
Carlyle plans to deepen its footprint in the auto components sector by expanding the platform through further acquisitions. The founders of both companies will retain stakes in the platform, underscoring their long-term commitment.
 
“We believe India offers a tremendous opportunity in the advanced manufacturing sector, particularly in the auto components supply chain for both domestic and export markets,” said Amit Jain, managing director and head, Carlyle India Advisors. “We believe creating scale through consolidation will enable investments in technology, talent, and systems, allowing the platform to deliver an enhanced value proposition for its customers.”
 
The platform will benefit from Carlyle’s global network and operational expertise. Mohit Oswal, managing director of Roop, will serve as non-executive chairperson of the new entity. The board will also include Mark Blaufuss, an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, and Kishore Saletore, former executive director and group chief financial officer at Bharat Forge.
 
The deal is part of Carlyle’s broader push into industrials. The firm has invested over $32 billion in the sector globally, including $1.1 billion in Asia as of December 31, 2024.
