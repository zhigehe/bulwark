After a great display of fielding in the first ODI in Nagpur, Indian fielders had an underwhelming outing in Cuttack as they dropped two catches that went on to cost them a lot of runs. Axar Patel first dropped Phil Salt at third man on just 6, as the batter added 20 more runs after getting the lifeline, while Shreyas Iyer dropped Ben Duckett on 54, who went on to make 65 before getting dismissed. However, Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill buried all doubts of fans about the fielding quality of the Men in Blue after he took a stunning catch to remove Harry Brook, who was looking dangerous in his 66-run partnership with Joe Root. 
 
**As it happened** 
On the third ball of the 30th over of the innings by Harshit Rana, Harry Brook decided to come down the track and clear the long-off boundary but was unable to find proper connection. Gill, who was standing at mid-on, ran behind the ball and took a stunning diving catch to uplift the spirits of the Indian fielders in the match.
