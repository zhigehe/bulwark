Market review
-------------

Benchmark indices took a sharp hit on Friday after the [Reserve Bank of India (RBI)](https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-reserve-bank-of-india) decided to keep the repo rate steady without any guidance on a rate cut, weighing on private bank stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex dropped 724 points, or 1 per cent, to close at 71,428, while the Nifty50 fell 213 points, or 0.97 per cent, to 21,718. Both indices hit intraday lows of 71,230.62 and 21,665.30, respectively.
 
On Monday, the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 opened on a muted note amid mixed global cues. At the open, the Sensex was down 19.36 points, or 0.02 per cent, at 77,840, and the Nifty50 was at 23,522.45, down 37.50 points, or 0.16 per cent.

While the [RBI's 25 basis point repo rate cut](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/rbi-mpc-monetary-policy-committee-rate-cuts-gdp-inflation-sanjay-malhotra-125020700340_1.html) on February 7 and the BJP's win in the Delhi Assembly elections over the weekend were expected, investor focus now shifts to Q3 earnings from India Inc, potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump, and continued foreign investor selling in Indian equities.
