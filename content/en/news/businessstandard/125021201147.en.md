**Canadian passport ranking 2025**
 
The Canadian passport remains among the strongest globally. The 2025 Henley Passport Index ranks it seventh worldwide, granting visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 188 countries. Canada’s ranking has improved from eighth place in 2024 and follows a peak at sixth place in September 2023. It remains ahead of the United States, which is currently ranked ninth.
 
**Revised immigration targets**
Canada has adjusted its immigration targets for the coming years. The federal government now plans to admit 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, down from the previously planned 500,000. Targets will continue to decrease, with 380,000 new permanent residents in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.
 
In addition to lowering permanent resident numbers, Canada is also managing temporary resident arrivals. The government intends to reduce the proportion of temporary residents to 5% of the national population by the end of 2026. 
 
Planned intake figures include:
 
2025: 673,650 new temporary resident arrivals
2026: 516,600
2027: 543,600
 
These figures include work and study permits issued to newcomers.
 
**Study permit changes**
For 2025, Canada plans to issue 437,000 study permits, a 10% decrease from the 485,000 allocated in 2024. Of these, 316,276 permits will require a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL), covering college students, undergraduates, language students, graduate diploma candidates, and master’s and doctoral students. The remaining permits are designated for students exempt from the PAL requirement, such as those in K-12 education, exchange programmes, or renewing study permits at the same institution.
 
“Our immigration system has faced growing pressures both within and outside our borders. Multiple humanitarian crises, rising asylum claims, and increased interest in Canada have bumped up against our own economic demands and community needs. These pressures have required us to adapt our immigration levels planning to the current climate,” said Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.
 
Miller added that Canada has introduced changes to its international student programme, including financial requirement updates, a cap on study permit applications, work reforms, and a system to verify letters of acceptance.
 
**Labour market and entrepreneurship**
Immigrants continue to play a crucial role in Canada’s workforce and economy. In 2023, they represented 28.9% of the labour force. Sectors seeing a rise in immigrant workers include professional, technical, and scientific services, as well as information, culture, and recreation.
