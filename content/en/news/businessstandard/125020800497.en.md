Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, Delhi will progress alongside the rest of the country. I can confidently say that AAP will be eliminated from the national capital.”
 
Delhi [BJP president Virendra Sachdeva](https://www.business-standard.com/elections/delhi-elections/delhi-will-have-bjp-cm-central-leadership-will-decide-who-sachdeva-125020800351_1.html) also expressed confidence in forming the next government, stating, “The results so far are in line with our expectations, but we will wait for the final outcome. We have no hesitation in saying that this win is a result of PM Modi’s vision. We will ensure Delhi gets a strong and stable government.”
 

AAP supporters show confidence despite BJP’s lead
-------------------------------------------------

Despite the BJP’s lead, visuals from AAP’s party office at 11 am showed supporters dancing, suggesting confidence in a turnaround. The AAP was leading in 29 seats, with party chief [Arvind Kejriwal](https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-arvind-kejriwal) in a neck-and-neck against BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh from the New Delhi constituency.
 
The AAP has dominated Delhi politics for the last 10 years, securing landslide victories in 2015 and 2020. However, this election presents its biggest challenge as the BJP gains momentum.

Congress struggles for a comeback
---------------------------------

The Congress, which ruled Delhi from 1998 to 2013 under then-Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, has struggled in recent elections, failing to win a single seat in 2015 and 2020. While the party hopes for a revival, the early trends indicate another tough battle.
 

Delhi Assembly elections 2025
-----------------------------

Delhi, home to over 15 million eligible voters, recorded a 60.54 per cent turnout in the February 5 elections. With both BJP and AAP workers celebrating, all eyes remain on the final results to determine who will form Delhi’s next government.
