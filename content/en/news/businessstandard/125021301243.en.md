Quick commerce (q-com) is poised to lead gig workforce hiring in 2025, driven by a surge in demand for faster deliveries, expansion by existing players, the entry of new competitors, and evolving consumer preferences in the post-pandemic era, according to industry experts.
 
The q-com industry currently employs approximately 2.6 lakh personnel, including around 2 lakh delivery personnel and 60,000 dark store workers, according to TeamLease Staffing.
