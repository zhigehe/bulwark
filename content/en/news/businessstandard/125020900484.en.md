While the technicians seemed to have fixed it at one point, the flickering started again and saw the players leaving the field after 6.1 overs with India 48 for no loss at the moment. 
**Rohit looking in fine touch** 
Fans were delighted to see Indian skipper Rohit Sharma hitting the sixes and fours again at the beginning of the innings after the 'Hitman' was sent back tot he pavilion on just 2 runs in the 1st ODI and was under constant criticism from the pundits for his poor form in international cricket over multiple formats in recent matches.
