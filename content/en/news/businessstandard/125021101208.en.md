US Vice President JD Vance addressed a Paris summit on artificial intelligence, stating that the Trump administration will “ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias” and that the US would “never restrict our citizens’ right to free speech.”  
 
During his speech on Tuesday, Vance also emphasised his opposition to “excessive regulation” of the rapidly expanding AI industry, warning world leaders, tech executives, and researchers that such measures would stifle the “transformative industry.”
 
“Now, at this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new industrial revolution, one on par with the invention of the steam engine,’' Vance said, adding, ‘’But it will never come to pass. If overregulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball.’' 
 
His remarks reflected a sharp contrast to Europe’s regulatory-driven approach to AI governance. While the European Union (EU) is moving forward with the AI Act, one of the world’s most comprehensive regulatory frameworks, the Trump administration remains committed to a hands-off strategy designed to foster innovation and global leadership in AI.
 

**Global power struggle over AI**
---------------------------------

 
The Paris summit has drawn world leaders, top executives, and policymakers into heated discussions on AI’s role in security, economics, and governance. The event has highlighted a three-way race for AI dominance:
 
- The US, under President Donald Trump, champions a hands-off, pro-innovation strategy.
 
- Europe seeks tighter regulations while ramping up public investment in AI.
 
- China is expanding its AI capabilities through state-backed tech giants, pushing for global influence in AI standard-setting.
