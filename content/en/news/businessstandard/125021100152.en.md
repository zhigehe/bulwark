**Nifty Strategy: Short Strangle (13FEB2025 series)**
 
**Strategy Details:**
  **Expiry: 13FEB2025**
  **Strikes: Sell 22800PE and Sell 24000CE**
  **Net Inflow: 18**
  **Stop Loss: 36**
  **Target: Entire Premium Inflow**
  **Rationale:**
  >> There is an improvement in the overall market breadth over the last week, suggesting a limited downside capped within 22900. On the higher side, 23800 remains crucial and might take some time before it is breached.
  >> Given this setup, the market is likely to consolidate within this range, making a Short Strangle strategy an ideal choice to capitalize on time decay (Theta decay). 
  >> This strategy offers the potential for profits if the market remains range-bound along with a contraction in Volatility and Theta decay.
