***Here's how analysts are assessing today's (February 11) trading session:***
 
**Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities**
  We believe that the current market texture is weak, but a fresh sell-off is only possible if the 20-day SMA or 23,300/77000 is dismissed. Below this level, it could retest the range of 23,220-23,175/76700-76500. On the other hand, 23,500/77600 would be the key resistance zone for the bulls. Above this level, the pullback could extend up to 23,560/77800.
 
**Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities**
 
In the short term, the trend may worsen below 23,350, with the potential to fall toward 23,000 if it sustains below this level. On the higher end, resistance is seen at 23,550.
