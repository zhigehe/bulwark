The nearly two-decade old business correspondent (BC) network needs attention. Remuneration is a sticking point and retention of field agents has become a matter of concern even as banks use the network to save on last-mile financial inclusion costs. Talks are on if the agents can be used to vend other financial services and products. **ANAND KUMAR BAJAJ**, founder-managing director (MD) and chief executive officer of PayNearby, spoke with *Raghu Mohan* in a telephone interview. Edited excerpts:
 
**The BC network was rolled out nearly two decades ago. Is it time to be reimagined?**
