Out of the eight teams participating in the Champions Trophy 2025, only five teams will play warm-up matches before the start of the tournament on February 19 in Lahore. 
 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, New Zealand, South Africa and Bangladesh are the five teams that will participate in the warm-up matches.
 
Afghanistan, South Africa, and Bangladesh will take centre stage on February 14 and 17, while Afghanistan will also lock horns with New Zealand on February 16. These encounters will be the last opportunity for squads to sharpen their form before the high-stakes tournament kicks off.
 
Meanwhile, South Africa and New Zealand have already arrived in Pakistan for a tri-series with the hosts, adding to the intense build-up. 
 
In a strategic move, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced three separate Pakistan Shaheens squads for the warm-up clashes. Shadab Khan will lead the charge against Afghanistan in Lahore on February 14. On February 17, the Shaheens will take the field in two locations—Mohammad Hurraira will captain the side against South Africa in Karachi, while Mohammad Haris will lead against Bangladesh in Dubai.
 
The Afghanistan-New Zealand showdown on February 16 will unfold in Karachi, setting the stage for the grand tournament.   [**Check ICC Champions Trophy 2025 full schedule, match timings (IST) here**](https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/schedule)
