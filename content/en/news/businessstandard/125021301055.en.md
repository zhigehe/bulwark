A number of people were injured after an uncontrolled car rammed into a group of people in Munich, said German police.
 
While the authorities did not immediately give a specific number of injuries or provide details about the incident on Thursday, police said on social platform X that the driver was “secured” at the scene and no longer poses any danger.
 
A demonstration by the service workers’ union was taking place at the time of the incident.
