The hosts, Pakistan, are all set to face South Africa in the final group-stage match of the ODI tri-series on Wednesday, February 12, at the National Stadium in Karachi, with a place in the final against New Zealand up for grabs. Both Pakistan and South Africa lost to New Zealand in their previous game, which gave New Zealand a ticket to the final while making the last group-stage match between the hosts and the Proteas a virtual semi-final.
 
Pakistan will be the more desperate side to win the game, as the last thing they would want is to get eliminated from the group stage of the tri-series in their own backyard, especially when they will host the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the same venues as the defending champions.

On the other hand, South Africa, who announced six uncapped players for the series, will also wish to try their luck in winning the match and the series altogether to gain momentum before the start of the Champions Trophy next week.
