**Tesla in India?**
 
Notably, Musk has long advocated for lower import tariffs on Tesla’s electric vehicles in India. Reports indicate that he has been in discussions with Indian officials regarding the possibility of exporting affordable EV models to the country. He has also hinted that Tesla’s expansion in India would depend on the government’s willingness to ease import duties.  
 
According to media reports, Musk may also have explored potential cooperation between SpaceX and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) during his meeting with PM Modi. Given India’s expanding space programme and SpaceX’s dominance in commercial spaceflight, the collaboration could provide a significant boost to India’s private space sector.
