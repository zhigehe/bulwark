The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on track to form the government in Delhi after a 27-year gap, following a strong showing in the 2025 Assembly elections. If this trend holds, it will mark a return to power for the same party both at the state level and in the Centre after a decade.
 
By 4:30 pm, the BJP had secured 39 seats and was leading in 9 constituencies, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI). In contrast, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had won 17 constituencies and was leading in 5.
 
Key AAP leaders, including former CM Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Saurabh Bharadwaj, have been defeated in their respective constituencies of New Delhi, Jangpura, and Greater Kailash. 
 
With a voter turnout of 60.54 per cent in the 2025 assembly elections, the results reflect intense competition in several key constituencies.
