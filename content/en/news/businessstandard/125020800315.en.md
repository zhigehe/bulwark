Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal, seeking a fourth consecutive term as Delhi’s Chief Minister, is trailing in the New Delhi assembly constituency—an area he has won in the last three elections. BJP’s Parvesh Verma has taken the lead, according to early trends.
 
Adding to the high-profile contest, Congress’ Sandeep Dikshit, son of former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, is also in the race from this key constituency. 

**Early trends: BJP leads, AAP in close fight**

* BJP leading in 28 seat

* AAP ahead in 24 seatss

* Congress leading in 1 seat

 
The Delhi Assembly has 70 seats, and a party needs 36 to form a government. While these early numbers are still evolving, they suggest a tight contest between BJP and AAP.
