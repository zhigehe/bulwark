The ex-date and record date mark two important key events in ascertaining the shareholders' eligibility for participation in the dividend announcements. The ex-date refers to the day when a stock begins trading without dividend entitlement, meaning investors must own the stock before this date to receive the payout. The record date, on the other hand, is when companies finalise the list of eligible shareholders based on their records.
