Former Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal has lost from the New Delhi constituency, a seat that has been the party's stronghold for the last decade. 
 
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma has emerged victorious, securing 28.448 votes. 
Kejriwal's vote tally stood at 24,583, while Verma had 28448 votes after 12/13 rounds of counting. 
Five hours into the vote counting, trends indicate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is ahead in 47 of the 70 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has secured leads in 23 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections. The Congress, aiming for a revival after poor showings in the last two elections, appears headed for another setback with no wins in sight.
