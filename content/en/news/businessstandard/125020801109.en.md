India secured a narrow four-wicket victory over England in the first ODI, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Virat Kohli was absent from the first match due to a swollen knee, but according to Shubman Gill, Kohli is expected to return when India take the field again for the second ODI on February 9 at Barabati Stadium in Cuttack.   All eyes will be on Indian captain Rohit Sharma as he aims to find his form, while Virat Kohli could make his return after missing the last game due to injury. Both players will be eager to make an impact as India looks to fine-tune their squad ahead of the Champions Trophy. It remains uncertain whether the team will make changes, particularly to their bowling attack, or maintain their current combinations.  **ALSO READ: [2nd ODI preview: Rohit's lean run, Kohli's return in focus against England](https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/news/2nd-odi-preview-rohit-s-lean-run-kohli-s-return-in-focus-against-england-125020800507_1.html)**
