YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, popularly known as BeerBiceps, has apologised over an obscene joke he made on a comedy show and called it a "lapse in judgement."
 
"My comment wasn't just inappropriate, it wasn't even funny. Comedy is not my forte. I'm just here to say sorry. Many of you asked if this is how I wish to use my platform and obviously this is not how I wish to use it. I'm not going to give any context or justification or reasoning behind whatever happened," he said in a video posted on X.

Allahbadia's statement comes shortly after a formal complaint was filed against him, social media influencer Apoorva Makhija, comedian Samay Raina, and the organisers of the show 'India's Got Latent.' Allahbadia made the comments during a YouTube episode of 'India's Got Latent,' which is hosted by Raina.
