The United Nations has raised alarm over the escalating threat of Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), the Afghanistan-based affiliate of ISIS, warning that it poses a serious risk to regional and global security, reported *Voice of America.*
 
During a Security Council meeting on Monday, UN counterterrorism chief Vladimir Voronkov called IS-K one of the “most dangerous branches” of the terror network, citing its deadly attacks on Afghan civilians and the Taliban regime.
 
“ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region, and beyond,” Voronkov stated. He further revealed that IS-K operatives have been linked to terror plots in Europe and are actively recruiting from Central Asia. 
 

**US and China voice concerns**
-------------------------------

Meanwhile, US Ambassador Dorothy Shea also echoed these concerns, warning that IS-K remains a major threat beyond Afghanistan. “We remain concerned about ISIS-K’s capabilities to plot and conduct attacks, as well as sustain recruitment campaigns, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Shea said.
 
China’s envoy, Fu Cong, added that IS-K, along with al-Qaida and the anti-China East Turkestan Islamic Movement, is actively operating in Afghanistan. He urged the Taliban government to take “visible and verifiable action” to eliminate these groups.
 

**Russia blames US withdrawal for IS-K’s rise**
-----------------------------------------------

On the other hand, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia pointed fingers at the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of US-led Nato forces from Afghanistan, arguing that it created a power vacuum that IS-K quickly exploited.
 
“The growing activity of ISIL-Khorasan is no coincidence. While hastily leaving Afghanistan, Nato troops abandoned vast quantities of weapons and equipment there, which then fell into the hands of ISIL,” Nebenzia stated.
 

**Pakistan rejects US accusations**
-----------------------------------

Pakistan’s UN representative, Munir Akram, pushed back against US claims that IS-K is recruiting fighters within Pakistan. He emphasised that Afghanistan remains “the main hub for ISIL-K’s recruitment and facilitation,” dismissing any suggestion that the terror group is gaining ground in his country.
 

**Taliban downplays IS-K threat**
---------------------------------

The Taliban has yet to officially respond to the UN warnings but has consistently dismissed claims that IS-K is operating in Afghanistan. Taliban leaders insist that their security forces have successfully dismantled IS-K hideouts and that the group no longer poses a serious threat.
 
Despite these assurances, IS-K continues to launch deadly attacks. In December, a suicide bomber killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban’s minister of refugees, in one of the most high-profile assassinations since the group took control of Afghanistan.
