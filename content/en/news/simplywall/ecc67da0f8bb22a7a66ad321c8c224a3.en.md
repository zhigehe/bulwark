The **PSI Software SE** ([ETR:PSAN](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/software/etr-psan/psi-software-shares)) share price has done very well over the last month, posting an excellent gain of 26%. Looking further back, the 16% rise over the last twelve months isn't too bad notwithstanding the strength over the last 30 days.

Although its price has surged higher, PSI Software may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or "P/S") ratio of 1.6x, since almost half of all companies in the Software industry in Germany have P/S ratios greater than 2.3x and even P/S higher than 10x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/S.

### What Does PSI Software's P/S Mean For Shareholders?

PSI Software could be doing better as it's been growing revenue less than most other companies lately. Perhaps the market is expecting the current trend of poor revenue growth to continue, which has kept the P/S suppressed. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping revenue doesn't get any worse and that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?
-------------------------------------------------------------

In order to justify its P/S ratio, PSI Software would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the industry.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow revenues by a handy 4.0% last year. Revenue has also lifted 12% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing revenue over that time.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 7.9% each year as estimated by the six analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 14% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.

With this in consideration, its clear as to why PSI Software's P/S is falling short industry peers. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.

The Bottom Line On PSI Software's P/S
-------------------------------------

PSI Software's stock price has surged recently, but its but its P/S still remains modest. Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

We've established that PSI Software maintains its low P/S on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider industry, as expected. Shareholders' pessimism on the revenue prospects for the company seems to be the main contributor to the depressed P/S. The company will need a change of fortune to justify the P/S rising higher in the future.
