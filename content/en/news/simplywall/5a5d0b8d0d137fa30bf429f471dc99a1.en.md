In the last year, many **AvidXchange Holdings, Inc.** ([NASDAQ:AVDX](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-avdx/avidxchange-holdings)) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AvidXchange Holdings
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Co-Founder, Michael Praeger, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$12.80 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$10.14). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.
