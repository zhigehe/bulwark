This week we saw the **Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao** ([BVMF:PCAR3](https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/consumer-retailing/bovespa-pcar3/companhia-brasileira-de-distribuicao-shares)) share price climb by 12%. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. After all, the share price is down 97% in that time, significantly under-performing the market. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.

While the stock has risen 12% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.

Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.

Over half a decade Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 22% for each year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 14% per year in that period. This kind of price performance makes us very wary, especially when combined with falling revenue. Of course, the poor performance could mean the market has been too severe selling down. That can happen.

What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?
----------------------------------------------

Investors should note that there's a difference between Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao's TSR, which was a 6.6% *drop* over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

While the broader market lost about 1.2% in the twelve months, Companhia Brasileira De Distribuicao shareholders did even worse, losing 25%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
