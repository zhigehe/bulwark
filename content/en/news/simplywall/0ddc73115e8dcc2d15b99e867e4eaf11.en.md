With a median price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of close to 17x in the Netherlands, you could be forgiven for feeling indifferent about **Flow Traders Ltd.'s**  ([AMS:FLOW](https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/diversified-financials/ams-flow/flow-traders-shares)) P/E ratio of 16.1x. Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.

While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Flow Traders' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile.

ENXTAM:FLOW Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry February 14th 2025

 Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our [**free** report on Flow Traders](https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/diversified-financials/ams-flow/flow-traders-shares/future) will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

How Is Flow Traders' Growth Trending?
-------------------------------------

In order to justify its P/E ratio, Flow Traders would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.

Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 18%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 59% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 15% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.

In light of this, it's understandable that Flow Traders' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

As we suspected, our examination of Flow Traders' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to support the share price at these levels.

Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. You can assess many of the main risks through our [**free** balance sheet analysis for Flow Traders](https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/diversified-financials/ams-flow/flow-traders-shares/health) with six simple checks.
