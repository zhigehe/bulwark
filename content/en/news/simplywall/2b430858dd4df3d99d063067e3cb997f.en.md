The analysts covering **TotalEnergies SE** ([EPA:TTE](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/energy/epa-tte/totalenergies-shares)) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for this year. This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.

Following the latest downgrade, the 20 analysts covering TotalEnergies provided consensus estimates of US$191b revenue in 2025, which would reflect a noticeable 2.1% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$214b in 2025. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on TotalEnergies, noting the measurable cut to revenue estimates in this update.

ENXTPA:TTE Earnings and Revenue Growth February 14th 2025

There was no particular change to the consensus price target of US$71.87, with TotalEnergies' latest outlook seemingly not enough to result in a change of valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic TotalEnergies analyst has a price target of US$93.76 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$62.25. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.

Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 2.1% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 9.6% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 2.5% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - TotalEnergies is expected to lag the wider industry.

The Bottom Line
---------------

The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their revenue estimates for this year. They're also anticipating slower revenue growth than the wider market. Given the stark change in sentiment, we'd understand if investors became more cautious on TotalEnergies after today.
