Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.

[Takasago International (TSE:4914)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4914/takasago-international-shares)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Dividend Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** Takasago International Corporation is involved in the manufacturing and sale of flavors, fragrances, aroma ingredients, and other fine chemicals, with a market cap of ¥100.38 billion.

**Operations:** Takasago International Corporation generates its revenue from various regions, with ¥43.63 billion from Asia, ¥94.10 billion from Japan, ¥41.42 billion from Europe, and ¥59.10 billion from the Americas.

**Dividend Yield:** 3.1%

Takasago International's dividend yield of 3.13% is below the top quartile in Japan, and while dividends have grown reliably over the past decade, they are not well covered by free cash flow due to a high cash payout ratio of 639.1%. Despite this, the payout ratio based on earnings is a manageable 41%, suggesting dividends are supported by profits but not cash flows. Earnings increased significantly by 33.8% last year, indicating potential for future dividend stability.
