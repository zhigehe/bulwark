**Vipshop Holdings Limited's** ([NYSE:VIPS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-vips/vipshop-holdings)) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 6.8x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 19x and even P/E's above 34x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vipshop Holdings has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

Does Growth Match The Low P/E?
------------------------------

There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the market for P/E ratios like Vipshop Holdings' to be considered reasonable.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 18% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 91% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.

Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 11% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 11% per annum, which paints a poor picture.

With this information, we are not surprised that Vipshop Holdings is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.

What We Can Learn From Vipshop Holdings' P/E?
---------------------------------------------

Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

As we suspected, our examination of Vipshop Holdings' analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.
