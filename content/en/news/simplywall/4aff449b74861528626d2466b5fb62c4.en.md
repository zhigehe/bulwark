**CDON AB** ([STO:CDON](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-cdon/cdon-shares)) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 26% share price drop in the last month. For any long-term shareholders, the last month ends a year to forget by locking in a 61% share price decline.

Even after such a large drop in price, when almost half of the companies in Sweden's Multiline Retail industry have price-to-sales ratios (or "P/S") below 0.8x, you may still consider CDON as a stock probably not worth researching with its 1.6x P/S ratio. However, the P/S might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

OM:CDON Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 14th 2025

### How CDON Has Been Performing

CDON hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining revenue compares poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth in their revenues on average. It might be that many expect the dour revenue performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/S from collapsing. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.

Keen to find out how analysts think CDON's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our [**free** report is a great place to start](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-cdon/cdon-shares/future).

How Is CDON's Revenue Growth Trending?
--------------------------------------

There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the industry for P/S ratios like CDON's to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered virtually the same number to the company's top line as the year before. This isn't what shareholders were looking for as it means they've been left with a 27% decline in revenue over the last three years in total. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been undesirable for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 7.1% per annum as estimated by the dual analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 6.9% per annum, which is not materially different.

With this information, we find it interesting that CDON is trading at a high P/S compared to the industry. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of revenue growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

Despite the recent share price weakness, CDON's P/S remains higher than most other companies in the industry. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

Given CDON's future revenue forecasts are in line with the wider industry, the fact that it trades at an elevated P/S is somewhat surprising. The fact that the revenue figures aren't setting the world alight has us doubtful that the company's elevated P/S can be sustainable for the long term. A positive change is needed in order to justify the current price-to-sales ratio.
