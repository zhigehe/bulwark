Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, **Kras d.d.** ([ZGSE:KRAS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hr/food-beverage-tobacco/zgse-kras/kras-dd-shares)) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

When Is Debt Dangerous?
-----------------------

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.

What Is Kras d.d's Net Debt?
----------------------------

As you can see below, Kras d.d had €20.9m of debt at September 2024, down from €30.5m a year prior. However, it also had €4.28m in cash, and so its net debt is €16.7m.

ZGSE:KRAS Debt to Equity History February 14th 2025

A Look At Kras d.d's Liabilities
--------------------------------

According to the last reported balance sheet, Kras d.d had liabilities of €30.7m due within 12 months, and liabilities of €22.2m due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of €4.28m as well as receivables valued at €46.4m due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling €2.17m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Having regard to Kras d.d's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the €133.7m company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Kras d.d has net debt of just 0.96 times EBITDA, suggesting it could ramp leverage without breaking a sweat. And remarkably, despite having net debt, it actually received more in interest over the last twelve months than it had to pay. So there's no doubt this company can take on debt while staying cool as a cucumber. The good news is that Kras d.d has increased its EBIT by 5.7% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Kras d.d will need earnings to service that debt. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend.

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Kras d.d recorded free cash flow worth 69% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.

Our View
--------

Kras d.d's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Zooming out, Kras d.d seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Kras d.d has  [**1 warning sign**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hr/food-beverage-tobacco/zgse-kras/kras-dd-shares)  we think you should be aware of.
