OM:RROS Earnings and Revenue History February 14th 2025

A Closer Look At Rottneros' Earnings
------------------------------------

As finance nerds would already know, the **accrual ratio from cashflow** is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow.

Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.

For the year to December 2024, Rottneros had an accrual ratio of 0.24. Unfortunately, that means its free cash flow fell significantly short of its reported profits. Over the last year it actually had *negative* free cash flow of kr435m, in contrast to the aforementioned profit of kr20.0m. Coming off the back of negative free cash flow last year, we imagine some shareholders might wonder if its cash burn of kr435m, this year, indicates high risk. However, that's not all there is to consider. The accrual ratio is reflecting the impact of unusual items on statutory profit, at least in part.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can [click here to see an interactive graph](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-rros/rottneros-shares/past) depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?
--------------------------------------

Rottneros' profit suffered from unusual items, which reduced profit by kr13m in the last twelve months. In the case where this was a non-cash charge it would have made it easier to have high cash conversion, so it's surprising that the accrual ratio tells a different story. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Rottneros to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.

Our Take On Rottneros' Profit Performance
-----------------------------------------

In conclusion, Rottneros' accrual ratio suggests that its statutory earnings are not backed by cash flow, even though unusual items weighed on profit. Based on these factors, it's hard to tell if Rottneros' profits are a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.
