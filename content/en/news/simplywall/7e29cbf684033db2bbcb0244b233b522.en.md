Oita Bank's Earnings Will Easily Cover The Distributions
--------------------------------------------------------

Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much.

Oita Bank has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. While past records don't necessarily translate into future results, the company's payout ratio of 9.4% also shows that Oita Bank is able to comfortably pay dividends.

If the trend of the last few years continues, EPS will grow by 25.0% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the future payout ratio could be 17% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.

TSE:8392 Historic Dividend February 13th 2025

Dividend Volatility
-------------------

While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of ¥60.00 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of ¥100.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.2% over that duration. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow
---------------------------------

With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Oita Bank has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 25% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.

We Really Like Oita Bank's Dividend
-----------------------------------

Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Oita Bank is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.

Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.
