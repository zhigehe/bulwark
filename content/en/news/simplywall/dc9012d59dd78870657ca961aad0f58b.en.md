When close to half the companies in Poland have price-to-earnings ratios (or "P/E's") above 12x, you may consider **Instal Kraków S.A.** ([WSE:INK](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/capital-goods/wse-ink/instal-krakow-shares)) as a highly attractive investment with its 5.9x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.

With earnings growth that's exceedingly strong of late, Instal Kraków has been doing very well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

WSE:INK Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry February 7th 2025

 Want the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then our [**free** report on Instal Kraków](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/capital-goods/wse-ink/instal-krakow-shares/past) will help you shine a light on its historical performance.

Does Growth Match The Low P/E?
------------------------------

In order to justify its P/E ratio, Instal Kraków would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the market.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 53% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 51% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.

It's interesting to note that the rest of the market is similarly expected to grow by 14% over the next year, which is fairly even with the company's recent medium-term annualised growth rates.

With this information, we find it odd that Instal Kraków is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently some shareholders are more bearish than recent times would indicate and have been accepting lower selling prices.

The Final Word
--------------

Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

We've established that Instal Kraków currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is in line with the wider market forecast. When we see average earnings with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.
