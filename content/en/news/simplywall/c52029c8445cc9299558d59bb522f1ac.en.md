When close to half the companies in Poland have price-to-earnings ratios (or "P/E's") below 12x, you may consider **MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna** ([WSE:MLB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/software/wse-mlb/makolab-spolka-akcyjna-shares)) as a stock to potentially avoid with its 18.1x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

For example, consider that MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna's financial performance has been poor lately as its earnings have been in decline. It might be that many expect the company to still outplay most other companies over the coming period, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

WSE:MLB Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry February 14th 2025

 We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our [**free** report on MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna's](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/software/wse-mlb/makolab-spolka-akcyjna-shares/past) earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?
------------------------------------------------------

MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the market.

Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 21%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 48% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.

Weighing that medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 15% shows it's an unpleasant look.

In light of this, it's alarming that MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the recent poor growth rate and are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects. There's a very good chance existing shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the recent negative growth rates.

The Final Word
--------------

It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.

Our examination of MakoLab Spólka Akcyjna revealed its shrinking earnings over the medium-term aren't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted, given the market is set to grow. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as this earnings performance is highly unlikely to support such positive sentiment for long. If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it will place shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.
