These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the **Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd.** ([SHSE:600000](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/banks/shse-600000/shanghai-pudong-development-bank-shares)) share price is 48% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 21% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 20% in the last three years.

Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During the last year Shanghai Pudong Development Bank grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 27%. The share price gain of 48% certainly outpaced the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it a year ago.

What About Dividends?
---------------------

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Shanghai Pudong Development Bank the TSR over the last 1 year was 54%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

It's nice to see that Shanghai Pudong Development Bank shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 54% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 3%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Shanghai Pudong Development Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  [Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is showing  **1 warning sign in our investment analysis**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/banks/shse-600000/shanghai-pudong-development-bank-shares) , you should know about...
