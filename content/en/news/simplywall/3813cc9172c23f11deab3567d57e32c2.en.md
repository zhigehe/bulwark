Those holding **PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna** ([WSE:PCF](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/media/wse-pcf/pcf-group-spolka-akcyjna-shares)) shares would be relieved that the share price has rebounded 27% in the last thirty days, but it needs to keep going to repair the recent damage it has caused to investor portfolios. But the last month did very little to improve the 65% share price decline over the last year.

Although its price has surged higher, PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or "P/S") ratio of 1.9x, since almost half of all companies in the Entertainment industry in Poland have P/S ratios greater than 3.6x and even P/S higher than 7x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/S.

WSE:PCF Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 13th 2025

### What Does PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna's Recent Performance Look Like?

With revenue growth that's superior to most other companies of late, PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong revenue performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the share price, and thus the P/S ratio. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna's to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 12% gain to the company's revenues. Revenue has also lifted 9.3% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 45% each year as estimated by the three analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 33% each year growth forecast for the broader industry.

With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna's P/S sits behind most of its industry peers. It looks like most investors are not convinced at all that the company can achieve future growth expectations.

The Final Word
--------------

Despite PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna's share price climbing recently, its P/S still lags most other companies. Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

To us, it seems PCF Group Spólka Akcyjna currently trades on a significantly depressed P/S given its forecasted revenue growth is higher than the rest of its industry. When we see strong growth forecasts like this, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing significant pressure on the P/S ratio. It appears the market could be anticipating revenue instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.
