The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Convenience Retail Asia
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Non-Executive Chairman Kwok-Lun Fung made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for HK$3.3m worth of shares at a price of HK$0.66 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being HK$0.34). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Kwok-Lun Fung.

Kwok-Lun Fung purchased 12.81m shares over the year. The average price per share was HK$0.72.
