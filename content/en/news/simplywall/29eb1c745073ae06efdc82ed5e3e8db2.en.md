Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Alliance Entertainment Holding Corporation ([NASDAQ:AENT](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-aent/alliance-entertainment-holding)), by way of a worked example.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.

How Is ROE Calculated?
----------------------

The **formula for ROE** is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) รท Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alliance Entertainment Holding is:

9.6% = US$8.4m รท US$88m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.

Does Alliance Entertainment Holding Have A Good ROE?
----------------------------------------------------

One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Alliance Entertainment Holding has a similar ROE to the average in the [Retail Distributors industry](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/consumer-discretionary/retail-distributors) classification (11%).

So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.

How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?
--------------------------------------

Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.

Alliance Entertainment Holding's Debt And Its 9.6% ROE
------------------------------------------------------

Alliance Entertainment Holding does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.08. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.

Summary
-------

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.

But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
