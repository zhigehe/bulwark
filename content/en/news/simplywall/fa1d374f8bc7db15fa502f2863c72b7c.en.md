Every investor in Enovix Corporation ([NASDAQ:ENVX](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-envx/enovix)) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 47% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.7% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 7.0% for shareholders. Institutions or "liquidity providers" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Enovix, which might have negative implications on individual investors.
