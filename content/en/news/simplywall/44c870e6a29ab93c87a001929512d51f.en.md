We can readily understand why investors are attracted to unprofitable companies. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.

So, the natural question for **YLAB** ([KOSDAQ:432430](https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/media/kosdaq-a432430/ylab-shares)) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'.

How Well Is YLAB Growing?
-------------------------

We reckon the fact that YLAB managed to shrink its cash burn by 45% over the last year is rather encouraging. On top of that, operating revenue was up 21%, making for a heartening combination We think it is growing rather well, upon reflection. In reality, this article only makes a short study of the company's growth data. [This graph of historic earnings and revenue](https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/media/kosdaq-a432430/ylab-shares/past) shows how YLAB is building its business over time.

How Easily Can YLAB Raise Cash?
-------------------------------

While YLAB seems to be in a decent position, we reckon it is still worth thinking about how easily it could raise more cash, if that proved desirable. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).

YLAB has a market capitalisation of ₩78b and burnt through ₩6.6b last year, which is 8.5% of the company's market value. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.

How Risky Is YLAB's Cash Burn Situation?
----------------------------------------

As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about YLAB's cash burn. For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path. And even though its revenue growth wasn't quite as impressive, it was still a positive.
