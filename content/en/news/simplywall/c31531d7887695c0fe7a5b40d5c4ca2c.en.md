What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven *return* on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding *base* of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at **China United Network Communications** ([SHSE:600050](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/telecom/shse-600050/china-united-network-communications-shares)), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
-----------------------------------------------

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for China United Network Communications:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.035 = CN¥14b ÷ (CN¥672b - CN¥263b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Therefore, **China United Network Communications has an ROCE of 3.5%.** In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Wireless Telecom industry average of 10%.

The Trend Of ROCE
-----------------

Over the past five years, China United Network Communications' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at China United Network Communications in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that China United Network Communications has been paying out a decent 33% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.

What We Can Learn From China United Network Communications' ROCE
----------------------------------------------------------------

In a nutshell, China United Network Communications has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 12% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.
