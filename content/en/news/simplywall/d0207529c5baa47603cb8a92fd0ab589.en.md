The **Lyko Group AB (publ)** ([STO:LYKO A](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-lyko-a/lyko-group-shares)) share price has done very well over the last month, posting an excellent gain of 29%. Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 10% is also fairly reasonable.

Even after such a large jump in price, it's still not a stretch to say that Lyko Group's price-to-sales (or "P/S") ratio of 0.5x right now seems quite "middle-of-the-road" compared to the Specialty Retail industry in Sweden, where the median P/S ratio is around 0.6x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S.

OM:LYKO A Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 14th 2025

### How Has Lyko Group Performed Recently?

Recent times have been advantageous for Lyko Group as its revenues have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is moderate because investors think this strong revenue performance might be about to tail off. If the company manages to stay the course, then investors should be rewarded with a share price that matches its revenue figures.

Keen to find out how analysts think Lyko Group's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our [**free** report is a great place to start](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-lyko-a/lyko-group-shares/future).

Is There Some Revenue Growth Forecasted For Lyko Group?
-------------------------------------------------------

Lyko Group's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the industry.

If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 19%. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 72% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have definitely welcomed those medium-term rates of revenue growth.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per annum as estimated by the five analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 4.0% per annum growth forecast for the broader industry.

With this information, we find it interesting that Lyko Group is trading at a fairly similar P/S compared to the industry. It may be that most investors aren't convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.

What Does Lyko Group's P/S Mean For Investors?
----------------------------------------------

Its shares have lifted substantially and now Lyko Group's P/S is back within range of the industry median. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

Despite enticing revenue growth figures that outpace the industry, Lyko Group's P/S isn't quite what we'd expect. There could be some risks that the market is pricing in, which is preventing the P/S ratio from matching the positive outlook. It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.
