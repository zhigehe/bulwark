Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

How To Calculate Return On Equity?
----------------------------------

**Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:**

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zephyrus Wing Energies is:

26% = ₪127m ÷ ₪478m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every ₪1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated ₪0.26 in profit.

Does Zephyrus Wing Energies Have A Good Return On Equity?
---------------------------------------------------------

One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Zephyrus Wing Energies has a better ROE than the average (9.1%) in the [Renewable Energy industry](https://simplywall.st/markets/il/utilities/renewable-energy).

That's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  [Our risks dashboard](https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/utilities/tase-zprs/zephyrus-wing-energies-shares)should have the 3 risks we have identified for Zephyrus Wing Energies.

How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?
--------------------------------------

Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.

Combining Zephyrus Wing Energies' Debt And Its 26% Return On Equity
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Zephyrus Wing Energies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.78. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.

Summary
-------

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.

But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
