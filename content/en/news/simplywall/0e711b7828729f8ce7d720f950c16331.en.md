There wouldn't be many who think **Crane NXT, Co.'s** ([NYSE:CXT](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-cxt/crane-nxt)) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 19.4x is worth a mention when the median P/E in the United States is similar at about 19x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.

Crane NXT hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile.

How Is Crane NXT's Growth Trending?
-----------------------------------

There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Crane NXT's to be considered reasonable.

Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 13%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 2.0% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 23% as estimated by the six analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 14%, which is noticeably less attractive.

In light of this, it's curious that Crane NXT's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It may be that most investors aren't convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.

The Final Word
--------------

We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

We've established that Crane NXT currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is higher than the wider market. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the positive outlook. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price.
