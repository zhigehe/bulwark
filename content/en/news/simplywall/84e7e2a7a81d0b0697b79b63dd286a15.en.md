Algoma Central's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Based on the last payment, Algoma Central's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.

Over the next year, EPS could expand by 8.5% if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 44%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

TSX:ALC Historic Dividend February 13th 2025

Dividend Volatility
-------------------

The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of CA$0.28 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of CA$0.76. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.

We Could See Algoma Central's Dividend Growing
----------------------------------------------

With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Algoma Central has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 8.5% per annum. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.

Our Thoughts On Algoma Central's Dividend
-----------------------------------------

Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Algoma Central will make a great income stock. While Algoma Central is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.
