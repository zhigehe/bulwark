What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Gentrack Group?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Gentrack Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Gentrack Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

NZSE:GTK Earnings and Revenue Growth February 13th 2025

It would appear that 7.2% of Gentrack Group shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Milford Asset Management, LTD is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. Regal Partners Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and Australian Ethical Investment Limited holds about 5.5% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Gary Miles, the CEO has 1.6% of the shares allocated to their name.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Gentrack Group
-----------------------------------

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Gentrack Group Limited. As individuals, the insiders collectively own NZ$26m worth of the NZ$1.3b company. This shows at least some alignment. You can  [click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/nz/software/nzx-gtk/gentrack-group-shares/ownership)
