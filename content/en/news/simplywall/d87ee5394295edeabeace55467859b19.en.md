AOKI Holdings' Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, AOKI Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.

Looking forward, earnings per share could rise by 12.7% over the next year if the trend from the last few years continues. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 47%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

TSE:8214 Historic Dividend February 8th 2025

Dividend Volatility
-------------------

Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was ¥36.00 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was ¥55.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.3% over that duration. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow
---------------------------------

Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. AOKI Holdings has impressed us by growing EPS at 13% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.

We Really Like AOKI Holdings' Dividend
--------------------------------------

In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.

Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.
