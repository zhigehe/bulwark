Unfortunately, investing is risky - companies can and do go bankrupt. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can *make* more than 100%. For example, the **Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology Develop Co.,Ltd.** ([SZSE:000702](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/food-beverage-tobacco/szse-000702/hunan-zhenghong-science-and-technology-developltd-shares)) share price has soared 137% return in just a single year. It's also up 11% in about a month. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 8.6% in the last thirty days. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 54% in the last three years.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology DevelopLtd investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's one-year performance.

Because Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology DevelopLtd made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.

In the last year Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology DevelopLtd saw its revenue shrink by 13%. We're a little surprised to see the share price pop 137% in the last year. It just goes to show the market doesn't always pay attention to the reported numbers. Of course, it could be that the market expected this revenue drop.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

It's nice to see that Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology DevelopLtd shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 137% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Hunan Zhenghong Science and Technology DevelopLtd better, we need to consider many other factors.
