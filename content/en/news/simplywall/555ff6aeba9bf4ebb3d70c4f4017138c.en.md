### What Does 2CRSI's P/S Mean For Shareholders?

2CRSI could be doing better as its revenue has been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive revenue growth. Perhaps the market is expecting its poor revenue performance to improve, keeping the P/S from dropping. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.

Keen to find out how analysts think 2CRSI's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our [**free** report is a great place to start](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/future).

Do Revenue Forecasts Match The P/S Ratio?
-----------------------------------------

2CRSI's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the industry.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 27% decrease to the company's top line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk revenue by 23% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been undesirable for the company.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 37% per year over the next three years. With the industry only predicted to deliver 14% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result.

With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that 2CRSI's P/S is closely matching its industry peers. It may be that most investors aren't convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.

What Does 2CRSI's P/S Mean For Investors?
-----------------------------------------

Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.

Looking at 2CRSI's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook isn't giving the boost to its P/S that we would've expected. Perhaps uncertainty in the revenue forecasts are what's keeping the P/S ratio consistent with the rest of the industry. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future revenue could see some volatility.
