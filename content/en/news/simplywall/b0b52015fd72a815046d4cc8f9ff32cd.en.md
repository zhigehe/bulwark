KOSE:A005380 Ownership Breakdown February 10th 2025

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hyundai Motor?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

We can see that Hyundai Motor does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Hyundai Motor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Insider Ownership Of Hyundai Motor
----------------------------------

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Hyundai Motor Company. Insiders own â‚©3.3t worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking [if those insiders have been selling.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/automobiles/kose-a005380/hyundai-motor-shares/ownership) 

General Public Ownership
