**Hoist Finance AB (publ)'s** ([STO:HOFI](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/diversified-financials/sto-hofi/hoist-finance-shares)) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 8.1x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in Sweden, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 24x and even P/E's above 42x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Recent times have been advantageous for Hoist Finance as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

 Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our [**free** report on Hoist Finance](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/diversified-financials/sto-hofi/hoist-finance-shares/future) will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?
-----------------------------------------------------

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as depressed as Hoist Finance's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market decidedly.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 111% gain to the company's bottom line. However, the latest three year period hasn't been as great in aggregate as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over that time.

Turning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 14% as estimated by the dual analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 29% growth forecast for the broader market.

With this information, we can see why Hoist Finance is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.

As we suspected, our examination of Hoist Finance's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.
