What Is Cenergy Holdings Worth?
-------------------------------

The share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 16.1x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 16.25x, which means if you buy Cenergy Holdings today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Cenergy Holdings should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, it seems like Cenergy Holdings’s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
