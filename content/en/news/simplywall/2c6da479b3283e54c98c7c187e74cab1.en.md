Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of **Guideline Geo AB (publ)** ([STO:GGEO](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/energy/sto-ggeo/guideline-geo-shares)), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

Guideline Geo Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
-----------------------------------------------------

In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Chairman of the Board Anders Gemfors bought kr753k worth of shares at a price of kr8.40 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of kr9.74. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.

In the last twelve months insiders purchased 424.00k shares for kr4.4m. But they sold 46.74k shares for kr707k. In total, Guideline Geo insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The average buy price was around kr10.46. This is nice to see since it implies that insiders might see value around current prices. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

Guideline Geo Insiders Bought Stock Recently
--------------------------------------------

We saw some Guideline Geo insider buying shares in the last three months. MD & CEO Malin Siberg shelled out kr114k for shares in that time. We like it when there are only buyers, and no sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.

Insider Ownership
-----------------

Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Guideline Geo insiders own 43% of the company, currently worth about kr45m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.

So What Do The Guideline Geo Insider Transactions Indicate?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The recent insider purchase is heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Guideline Geo insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. That's what I like to see! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this, we've discovered [**3 warning signs**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/energy/sto-ggeo/guideline-geo-shares) (2 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Guideline Geo.
