Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding *base* of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over **UFP Technologies'** ([NASDAQ:UFPT](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-ufpt/ufp-technologies)) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
-----------------------------------------------

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for UFP Technologies, this is the formula:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.13 = US$74m รท (US$639m - US$78m) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Therefore, **UFP Technologies has an ROCE of 13%.** In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 11% it's much better.

So How Is UFP Technologies' ROCE Trending?
------------------------------------------

While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 213% more capital into its operations. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UFP Technologies has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

In the end, UFP Technologies has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 384% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
