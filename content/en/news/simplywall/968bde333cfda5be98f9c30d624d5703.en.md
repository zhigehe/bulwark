### Key Insights

* A total of 3 investors have a majority stake in the company with 57% ownership
* [Recent purchases by insiders](https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/real-estate-management-and-development/jse-lte/lighthouse-properties-shares/ownership)

Every investor in Lighthouse Properties p.l.c. ([JSE:LTE](https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/real-estate-management-and-development/jse-lte/lighthouse-properties-shares)) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 44% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Last weekâ€™s 7.4% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 16% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lighthouse Properties.

JSE:LTE Ownership Breakdown February 14th 2025

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lighthouse Properties?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Lighthouse Properties does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lighthouse Properties, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

JSE:LTE Earnings and Revenue Growth February 14th 2025

Lighthouse Properties is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Resilient REIT Limited is the largest shareholder with 31% of shares outstanding. Desmond de Beer is the second largest shareholder owning 19% of common stock, and Public Investment Corporation Limited holds about 7.7% of the company stock.

To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Lighthouse Properties
------------------------------------------

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Lighthouse Properties p.l.c.. Insiders have a R3.8b stake in this R15b business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking [if those insiders have been buying recently.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/real-estate-management-and-development/jse-lte/lighthouse-properties-shares/ownership) 

General Public Ownership
------------------------

With a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lighthouse Properties. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Private Company Ownership
-------------------------

Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 7.4%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
