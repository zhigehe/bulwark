What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About TegoScience?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutional investors often avoid companies that are too small, too illiquid or too risky for their tastes. But it's unusual to see larger companies without any institutional investors.

There are many reasons why a company might not have any institutions on the share registry. It may be hard for institutions to buy large amounts of shares, if liquidity (the amount of shares traded each day) is low. If the company has not needed to raise capital, institutions might lack the opportunity to build a position. Alternatively, there might be something about the company that has kept institutional investors away. TegoScience might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.

KOSDAQ:A191420 Earnings and Revenue Growth February 13th 2025

TegoScience is not owned by hedge funds. With a 38% stake, CEO Saewha Jeon is the largest shareholder. With 4.8% and 0.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, Jaewook Jeon and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP are the second and third largest shareholders. Interestingly, the second-largest shareholder, Jaewook Jeon is also Top Key Executive, again, pointing towards strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders.

On studying our ownership data, we found that 6 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of TegoScience
--------------------------------

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in TegoScience Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just ₩161b, and insiders have ₩68b worth of shares in their own names. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares.

General Public Ownership

The general public -- including retail investors -- own 57% of TegoScience. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
