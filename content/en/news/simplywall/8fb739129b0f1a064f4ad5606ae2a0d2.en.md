The last three months have been tough on **Beat Holdings Limited** ([TSE:9399](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9399/beat-holdings-shares)) shareholders, who have seen the share price decline a rather worrying 69%. On the other hand, over the last twelve months the stock has delivered rather impressive returns. During that period, the share price soared a full 244%. So we think most shareholders won't be too upset about the recent fall. Investors should be wondering whether the business itself has the fundamental value required to continue to drive gains.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.

We don't think Beat Holdings' revenue of US$2,248,000 is enough to establish significant demand. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Beat Holdings will significantly advance the business plan before too long.

As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. You should be aware that there is always a chance that this sort of company will need to issue more shares to raise money to continue pursuing its business plan. While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Some Beat Holdings investors have already had a taste of the sweet taste stocks like this can leave in the mouth, as they gain popularity and attract speculative capital.

Beat Holdings had liabilities exceeding cash by US$12m when it last reported in June 2024, according to our data. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. So the fact that the stock is up 66% in the last year shows that high risks can lead to high rewards, sometimes. Investors must really like its potential.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

It's good to see that Beat Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 244% in the last twelve months. That certainly beats the loss of about 13% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.
