CB Financial Services' Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important.

Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, CB Financial Services has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but CB Financial Services' payout ratio of 41% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.

Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 20.2%. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 49% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.

NasdaqGM:CBFV Historic Dividend February 7th 2025

CB Financial Services Has A Solid Track Record
----------------------------------------------

The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.8% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.

The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited
-------------------------------------------

Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Unfortunately, CB Financial Services' earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year.

Our Thoughts On CB Financial Services' Dividend
-----------------------------------------------

In summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.
