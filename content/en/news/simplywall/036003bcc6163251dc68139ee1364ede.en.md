[Melco Holdings (TSE:6676)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6676/melco-holdings-shares)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Value Rating:** ★★★★★★

**Overview:** Melco Holdings Inc. is a company that, through its subsidiaries, focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling digital home appliances and PC peripherals both in Japan and internationally, with a market cap of ¥41.13 billion.

**Operations:** Melco Holdings generates revenue primarily from its IT-related segment, which contributes ¥110.13 billion, and the food segment, which adds ¥39.27 billion.

Melco Holdings, a nimble player in the tech sector, showcases a compelling narrative with its earnings surging 71.8% over the past year, outpacing the industry average of 1.9%. Despite this impressive growth, it's important to note that a ¥1.9 billion one-off gain significantly influenced these results. The firm operates debt-free now compared to five years ago when its debt-to-equity ratio was 9.9%, reflecting prudent financial management. However, future projections suggest an average annual earnings decline of 25.5% over the next three years, which could temper enthusiasm despite its attractive P/E ratio of 11.2x against Japan's market average of 13.3x.
