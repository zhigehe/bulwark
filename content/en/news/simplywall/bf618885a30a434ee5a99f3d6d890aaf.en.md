**Implenia AG** ([VTX:IMPN](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/capital-goods/vtx-impn/implenia-shares)) shareholders have had their patience rewarded with a 27% share price jump in the last month. Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 23% is also fairly reasonable.

In spite of the firm bounce in price, Implenia's price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 5.1x might still make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in Switzerland, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 23x and even P/E's above 32x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.

Recent times have been advantageous for Implenia as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.

Is There Any Growth For Implenia?
---------------------------------

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as depressed as Implenia's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market decidedly.

If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 84%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 10% per year as estimated by the four analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 12% per year.

In light of this, it's understandable that Implenia's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

Shares in Implenia are going to need a lot more upward momentum to get the company's P/E out of its slump. It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.

As we suspected, our examination of Implenia's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted  [**2 warning signs for Implenia**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/capital-goods/vtx-impn/implenia-shares)  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.
