**Simply Wall St Financial Health Rating:** ★★★★★☆

**Overview:** Valuno Group AB (publ) is a fintech company based in Sweden with a market cap of approximately SEK515.13 million.

**Operations:** The company's revenue is primarily derived from its Solution for e-Merchants segment, which generated €159.80 million.

**Market Cap:** SEK515.13M

Valuno Group AB, a fintech company with a market cap of SEK515.13 million, recently rebranded from QuickBit eu AB and reported significant revenue growth in its e-Merchants segment, generating €159.80 million. Despite being unprofitable with losses increasing by 74.3% annually over the past five years, Valuno maintains a positive cash runway for over three years without debt concerns. Its short-term assets (€10.5M) fall short of covering liabilities (€12.8M), but the company benefits from reduced volatility and no recent shareholder dilution, though both management and board are relatively inexperienced with average tenures under two years.

**Simply Wall St Financial Health Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** New Focus Auto Tech Holdings Limited is an investment holding company that manufactures and sells electronic and power-related automotive parts and accessories across the People’s Republic of China, the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific with a market cap of HK$860.85 million.

**Operations:** The company generates revenue from two main segments: CN¥410.94 million from its Manufacturing and Trading Business, and CN¥125.92 million from its Automobile Dealership and Service Business.

**Market Cap:** HK$860.85M

New Focus Auto Tech Holdings, with a market cap of HK$860.85 million, generates revenue primarily from its Manufacturing and Trading Business (CN¥410.94 million) and Automobile Dealership and Service Business (CN¥125.92 million). Despite being unprofitable with a negative return on equity (-13.65%), the company has reduced its debt to equity ratio over five years from 66.4% to 46.7%, maintaining more cash than total debt—a positive sign for financial stability among penny stocks.
