Is Korn Ferry Still Cheap?
--------------------------

According to our valuation model, Korn Ferry seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Korn Ferry today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $76.09, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Korn Ferry’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

NYSE:KFY Earnings and Revenue Growth February 13th 2025

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 5.4% expected over the next year, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Korn Ferry, at least in the short term.

What This Means For You
-----------------------

**Are you a shareholder?** KFY’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

**Are you a potential investor?** If you’ve been keeping an eye on KFY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.
