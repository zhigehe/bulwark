Let's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.

[Oriola Oyj (HLSE:OKDBV)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fi/healthcare/hel-okdbv/oriola-oyj-shares)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Financial Health Rating:** ★★★★★☆

**Overview:** Oriola Oyj, with a market cap of €176.49 million, operates in Sweden and Finland offering healthcare and wellbeing products.

**Operations:** The company's revenue is primarily generated from its operations in Sweden (€1.01 billion) and Finland (€550.3 million), with additional contributions from other countries (€69.7 million).

**Market Cap:** €176.49M

Oriola Oyj, with a market cap of €176.49 million, operates primarily in Sweden and Finland. The company is currently unprofitable but has stable weekly volatility and its debt is well covered by operating cash flow at 34.6%. Despite short-term liabilities exceeding short-term assets, Oriola's long-term liabilities are well managed, supported by more cash than total debt. The stock trades at a significant discount to its estimated fair value and earnings are forecasted to grow substantially. Recent changes in management might bring new strategic directions with experienced executives joining the team from diverse backgrounds in retail and pharmaceuticals.

[SIM Technology Group (SEHK:2000)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/tech/hkg-2000/sim-technology-group-shares)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Financial Health Rating:** ★★★★★★

**Overview:** SIM Technology Group Limited is an investment holding company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells handsets and IoT terminals across the People's Republic of China, Europe, the United States, and other Asian countries with a market cap of HK$782.32 million.

**Operations:** The company's revenue is primarily derived from its Handsets and IoT Terminals Business, including Electronics Manufacturing Services, which generated HK$374.90 million, complemented by HK$49.87 million from Property Management.

**Market Cap:** HK$782.32M

SIM Technology Group, with a market cap of HK$782.32 million, has recently achieved profitability after several years of growth challenges. The company is debt-free, enhancing its financial stability and reducing risk for investors. Its short-term assets of HK$1.1 billion comfortably cover both short- and long-term liabilities, indicating strong liquidity management. Despite a decline in year-to-date revenue to HK$360.9 million from the previous year's HK$473.9 million, the company's price-to-earnings ratio of 2.5x suggests it may be undervalued compared to the broader Hong Kong market average of 10x. Recent board changes could influence future strategic direction positively.
