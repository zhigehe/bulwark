SWX:DAE Earnings and Revenue History February 14th 2025

Examining Cashflow Against Dätwyler Holding's Earnings
------------------------------------------------------

One key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the **accrual ratio**. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.

As a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.

For the year to December 2024, Dätwyler Holding had an accrual ratio of -0.11. Therefore, its statutory earnings were quite a lot less than its free cashflow. Indeed, in the last twelve months it reported free cash flow of CHF128m, well over the CHF31.1m it reported in profit. Dätwyler Holding did see its free cash flow drop year on year, which is less than ideal, like a Simpson's episode without Groundskeeper Willie.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can [click here to see an interactive graph](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ch/capital-goods/vtx-dae/datwyler-holding-shares/past) depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

Our Take On Dätwyler Holding's Profit Performance
-------------------------------------------------

Dätwyler Holding's accrual ratio is solid, and indicates strong free cash flow, as we discussed, above. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Dätwyler Holding's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Dätwyler Holding at this point in time.
