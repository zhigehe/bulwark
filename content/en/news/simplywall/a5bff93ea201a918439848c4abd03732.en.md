**20 Microns Limited** ([NSE:20MICRONS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-20microns/20-microns-shares)) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 25% share price drop in the last month. Longer-term, the stock has been solid despite a difficult 30 days, gaining 17% in the last year.

Since its price has dipped substantially, 20 Microns' price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 10.7x might make it look like a strong buy right now compared to the market in India, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 30x and even P/E's above 56x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.

The earnings growth achieved at 20 Microns over the last year would be more than acceptable for most companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this respectable earnings growth might actually underperform the broader market in the near future. If that doesn't eventuate, then existing shareholders have reason to be optimistic about the future direction of the share price.

NSEI:20MICRONS Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry February 8th 2025

 Although there are no analyst estimates available for 20 Microns, take a look at this [**free** data-rich visualisation](https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-20microns/20-microns-shares/past) to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.

Does Growth Match The Low P/E?
------------------------------

In order to justify its P/E ratio, 20 Microns would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the market.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 18% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 89% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.

Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 26% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is pretty similar based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results.

With this information, we find it odd that 20 Microns is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently some shareholders are more bearish than recent times would indicate and have been accepting lower selling prices.

The Final Word
--------------

20 Microns' P/E looks about as weak as its stock price lately. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

Our examination of 20 Microns revealed its three-year earnings trends aren't contributing to its P/E as much as we would have predicted, given they look similar to current market expectations. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the company's performance. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions should normally provide more support to the share price.
