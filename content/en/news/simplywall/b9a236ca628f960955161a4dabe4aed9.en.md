[Sipef (ENXTBR:SIP)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/be/food-beverage-tobacco/ebr-sip/sipef-shares)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Dividend Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** Sipef NV is an agro-industrial company with a market cap of €586.52 million.

**Operations:** Sipef NV generates its revenue from various segments, including Palm ($386.46 million), Bananas and Horticulture ($38.59 million), Tea ($2.79 million), Rubber ($0.59 million), and Corporate activities ($1.37 million).

**Dividend Yield:** 3.4%

Sipef's dividend payments are well-covered by earnings, with a payout ratio of 34.5%, and by cash flows, with a cash payout ratio of 71.5%. However, the dividends have been volatile over the past decade and are considered unreliable due to inconsistent growth. The current yield is lower than the top Belgian dividend payers at 3.38%. Despite this, Sipef's price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5x suggests it may offer good value relative to the market average.

Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Société en commandite par actions has announced a dividend of €1.38 per share, with coverage by earnings and cash flows at payout ratios of 50.2% and 32.4%, respectively, indicating sustainability.

[Bayerische Motoren Werke (XTRA:BMW)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/automobiles/etr-bmw/bayerische-motoren-werke-shares)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Dividend Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft develops, manufactures, and sells automobiles, motorcycles, and related spare parts and accessories globally with a market cap of €47.60 billion.

**Operations:** Bayerische Motoren Werke's revenue is primarily derived from its Automotive segment at €128.15 billion, followed by Financial Services at €38.10 billion, and Motorcycles at €3.21 billion.

**Dividend Yield:** 7.4%

Bayerische Motoren Werke's dividend yield of 7.87% ranks in the top 25% of German payers, yet its sustainability is questionable due to lack of free cash flow coverage and volatile past payments. Despite a low payout ratio of 36%, indicating coverage by earnings, the dividends have been unreliable over the last decade. The stock trades at a good value relative to peers and below its estimated fair value, but financial positioning remains strained with debt not well covered by operating cash flow.
