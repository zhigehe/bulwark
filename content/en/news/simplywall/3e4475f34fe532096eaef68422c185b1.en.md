The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that **Hangzhou Freely Communication Co., Ltd.** ([SHSE:603602](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/capital-goods/shse-603602/hangzhou-freely-communication-shares)) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt A Problem?
-----------------------

Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

What Is Hangzhou Freely Communication's Debt?
---------------------------------------------

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2024 Hangzhou Freely Communication had CN¥704.9m of debt, an increase on CN¥293.7m, over one year. However, it does have CN¥293.3m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about CN¥411.6m.

SHSE:603602 Debt to Equity History February 9th 2025

A Look At Hangzhou Freely Communication's Liabilities
-----------------------------------------------------

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Hangzhou Freely Communication had liabilities of CN¥1.09b falling due within a year, and liabilities of CN¥320.0m due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of CN¥293.3m and CN¥903.3m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling CN¥215.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Since publicly traded Hangzhou Freely Communication shares are worth a total of CN¥3.89b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.

In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

Hangzhou Freely Communication has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.8 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 5.9 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Notably, Hangzhou Freely Communication's EBIT launched higher than Elon Musk, gaining a whopping 113% on last year. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Hangzhou Freely Communication will need earnings to service that debt. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out [this graph of its long term earnings trend](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/capital-goods/shse-603602/hangzhou-freely-communication-shares/past).

Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Hangzhou Freely Communication saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total. While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.

Our View
--------

Hangzhou Freely Communication's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its EBIT growth rate. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Hangzhou Freely Communication's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
