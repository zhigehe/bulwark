Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's *amount* of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think **Xinjiang Beixin Road & Bridge Group** ([SZSE:002307](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/capital-goods/szse-002307/xinjiang-beixin-road-bridge-group-shares)) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
------------------------------------------

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Xinjiang Beixin Road & Bridge Group:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.024 = CN¥1.0b ÷ (CN¥57b - CN¥14b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

So, **Xinjiang Beixin Road & Bridge Group has an ROCE of 2.4%.**  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Construction industry average of 6.1%.

What Does the ROCE Trend For Xinjiang Beixin Road & Bridge Group Tell Us?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The returns on capital haven't changed much for Xinjiang Beixin Road & Bridge Group in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 2.4% and the business has deployed 225% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.

In Conclusion...
----------------
