What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About StemRIM?
------------------------------------------------------------

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that StemRIM does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at StemRIM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

TSE:4599 Earnings and Revenue Growth February 13th 2025

StemRIM is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Katsuto Tamai, who is also the company's Chief Scientific Officer, holds the most number of shares at 16%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. Keiko Tamai is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and Kensuke Tomita holds about 8.1% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Masatsune Okajima directly holds 0.7% of the total shares outstanding.

We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track.

Insider Ownership Of StemRIM
----------------------------

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in StemRIM. Insiders have a JP¥10b stake in this JP¥22b business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking [if those insiders have been buying recently.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4599/stemrim-shares/ownership) 

General Public Ownership
------------------------

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 39% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Public Company Ownership
------------------------

Public companies currently own 7.5% of StemRIM stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.
