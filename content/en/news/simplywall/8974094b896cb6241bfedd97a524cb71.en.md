Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the **DNA Link, Inc.** ([KOSDAQ:127120](https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/pharmaceuticals-biotech/kosdaq-a127120/dna-link-shares)) share price is 88% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 5.9% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 78% in the last three years.

Since it's been a strong week for DNA Link shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.

DNA Link wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.

In the last year DNA Link saw its revenue grow by 0.5%. That's not great considering the company is losing money. The modest growth is probably largely reflected in the share price, which is up 88%. That's not a standout result, but it is solid - much like the level of revenue growth. It could be worth keeping an eye on this one, especially if growth accelerates.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

It's nice to see that DNA Link shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 88% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.
