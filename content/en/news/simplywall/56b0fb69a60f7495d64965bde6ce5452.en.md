What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at **Vamos Locação de Caminhões Máquinas e Equipamentos'** ([BVMF:VAMO3](https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/transportation/bovespa-vamo3/vamos-locacao-de-caminhoes-maquinas-e-equipamentos-shares)) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
-----------------------------------------------

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Vamos Locação de Caminhões Máquinas e Equipamentos:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.12 = R$2.4b ÷ (R$25b - R$4.5b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Thus, **Vamos Locação de Caminhões Máquinas e Equipamentos has an ROCE of 12%.**  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 12%.

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
----------------------------------

While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 12% and the business has deployed 808% more capital into its operations. Since 12% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.

One more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last five years, the reduction in current liabilities to 18% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. Effectively suppliers now fund less of the business, which can lower some elements of risk.

What We Can Learn From Vamos Locação de Caminhões Máquinas e Equipamentos' ROCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To sum it up, Vamos Locação de Caminhões Máquinas e Equipamentos has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. However, despite the favorable fundamentals, the stock has fallen 58% over the last three years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. That's why we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the fundamentals are appealing.
