If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the **Pidilite Industries Limited** ([NSE:PIDILITIND](https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-pidilitind/pidilite-industries-shares)) share price is up 84% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 11%.

So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During five years of share price growth, Pidilite Industries achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 75.46.

What About Dividends?
---------------------

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Pidilite Industries' TSR for the last 5 years was 88%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the *total* shareholder return.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

We're pleased to report that Pidilite Industries shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 13% a year, is even better. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Pidilite Industries better, we need to consider many other factors.
