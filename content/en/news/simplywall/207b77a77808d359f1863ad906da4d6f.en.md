TSE:4062 Earnings and Revenue History February 11th 2025

The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit
-------------------------------------

Importantly, our data indicates that IbidenLtd's profit was reduced by JPÂ¥7.4b, due to unusual items, over the last year. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect IbidenLtd to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can [click here to see an interactive graph](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/past) depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.
