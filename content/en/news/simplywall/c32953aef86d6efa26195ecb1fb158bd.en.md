What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating **Sun\*** ([TSE:4053](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4053/sun-shares)), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
------------------------------------------

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Sun\* is:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.14 = JP¥1.5b ÷ (JP¥14b - JP¥2.9b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Therefore, **Sun\* has an ROCE of 14%.** That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 15% generated by the IT industry.

So How Is Sun\*'s ROCE Trending?
--------------------------------

On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Sun\* doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 14% from 22% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.

The Bottom Line
---------------

To conclude, we've found that Sun\* is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 59% in the last three years. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think Sun\* has the makings of a multi-bagger.

Like most companies, Sun\* does come with some risks, and we've found [**1 warning sign**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4053/sun-shares)  that you should be aware of.
