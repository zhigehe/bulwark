NasdaqGS:FLEX Earnings and Revenue History February 13th 2025

The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit
-------------------------------------

For anyone who wants to understand Flex's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by US$130m due to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Flex to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can [click here to see an interactive graph](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-flex/flex/past) depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

An Unusual Tax Situation
------------------------

Just as we noted the unusual items, we must inform you that Flex received a tax benefit which contributed US$150m to the bottom line. This is meaningful because companies usually pay tax rather than receive tax benefits. The receipt of a tax benefit is obviously a good thing, on its own. However, the devil in the detail is that these kind of benefits only impact in the year they are booked, and are often one-off in nature. Assuming the tax benefit is not repeated every year, we could see its profitability drop noticeably, all else being equal.

Our Take On Flex's Profit Performance
-------------------------------------

In the last year Flex received a tax benefit, which boosted its profit in a way that might not be much more sustainable than turning prime farmland into gas fields. But on the other hand, it also saw an unusual item depress its profit. Based on these factors, it's hard to tell if Flex's profits are a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability. If you'd like to know more about Flex as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.
