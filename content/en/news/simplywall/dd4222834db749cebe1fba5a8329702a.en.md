Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in **McMillan Shakespeare Limited** ([ASX:MMS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/commercial-services/asx-mms/mcmillan-shakespeare-shares)) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 20%. That's well below the market return of 15%. On the bright side, the stock is actually *up* 18% in the last three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 11% in a month.

Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

Even though the McMillan Shakespeare share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.

It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.

McMillan Shakespeare's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.

What About Dividends?
---------------------

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McMillan Shakespeare's TSR for the last 1 year was -12%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the *total* shareholder return.

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

McMillan Shakespeare shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 15%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McMillan Shakespeare better, we need to consider many other factors.
