BOVESPA:FLRY3 Ownership Breakdown February 12th 2025

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fleury?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Fleury already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Fleury's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

BOVESPA:FLRY3 Earnings and Revenue Growth February 12th 2025

Our data indicates that hedge funds own 5.1% of Fleury. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Banco Bradesco S.A. is currently the largest shareholder, with 25% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Regina Pardini and Victor Pardini, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.6%. Victor Pardini, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.

On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Fleury
---------------------------

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Fleury S.A.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful R$2.0b stake in this R$6.5b business.
