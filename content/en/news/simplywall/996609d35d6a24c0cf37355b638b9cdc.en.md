With a price-to-sales (or "P/S") ratio of 1.2x **AIC Mines Limited** ([ASX:A1M](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-a1m/aic-mines-shares)) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all the Metals and Mining companies in Australia have P/S ratios greater than 59.6x and even P/S higher than 292x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so limited.

### What Does AIC Mines' Recent Performance Look Like?

Recent times haven't been great for AIC Mines as its revenue has been rising slower than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the uninspiring revenue performance to persist, which has repressed the growth of the P/S ratio. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping revenue doesn't get any worse and that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour.

Keen to find out how analysts think AIC Mines' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our [**free** report is a great place to start](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-a1m/aic-mines-shares/future).

How Is AIC Mines' Revenue Growth Trending?
------------------------------------------

In order to justify its P/S ratio, AIC Mines would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the industry.

If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 44%. However, the latest three year period hasn't been as great in aggregate as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing revenue over that time.

Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 19% per annum during the coming three years according to the five analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 569% each year growth forecast for the broader industry.

In light of this, it's understandable that AIC Mines' P/S sits below the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.

The Bottom Line On AIC Mines' P/S
---------------------------------

Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.

As expected, our analysis of AIC Mines' analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.
