If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the **Hangzhou Advance Gearbox Group Co., Ltd.** ([SHSE:601177](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/capital-goods/shse-601177/hangzhou-advance-gearbox-group-shares)) share price is 47% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 21% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! Looking back further, the stock price is 36% higher than it was three years ago.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for Hangzhou Advance Gearbox Group investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's one-year performance.

In his essay *The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville* Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During the last year, Hangzhou Advance Gearbox Group actually saw its earnings per share drop 4.1%.

We don't think that the decline in earnings per share is a good measure of the business over the last twelve months. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.

We doubt the modest 0.4% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 9.4% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.
