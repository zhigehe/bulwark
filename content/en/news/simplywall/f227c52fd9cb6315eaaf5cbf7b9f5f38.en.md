[Valuetronics Holdings (SGX:BN2)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/sg/tech/sgx-bn2/valuetronics-holdings-shares)

**Operations:** The company generates revenue from Consumer Electronics amounting to HK$376.58 million and Industrial and Commercial Electronics totaling HK$1.26 billion.

**Market Cap:** SGD264.27M

Valuetronics Holdings, with a market cap of SGD264.27 million, is an investment holding company in the electronics manufacturing sector, generating significant revenue from Consumer Electronics (HK$376.58 million) and Industrial and Commercial Electronics (HK$1.26 billion). The company has demonstrated financial stability with no debt and sufficient short-term assets (HK$1.8 billion) to cover liabilities. Despite a modest earnings growth forecast of 4.7% annually, its past five-year profit decline suggests challenges in sustained profitability improvement. Recent share buybacks reflect management's confidence but dividend sustainability remains questionable due to insufficient free cash flow coverage.
