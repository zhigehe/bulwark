If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding *base* of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think **Henan Liliang Diamond** ([SZSE:301071](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cn/materials/szse-301071/henan-liliang-diamond-shares)) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
------------------------------------------

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Henan Liliang Diamond is:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.039 = CN¥223m ÷ (CN¥6.5b - CN¥825m) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Therefore, **Henan Liliang Diamond has an ROCE of 3.9%.** Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Chemicals industry average of 5.5%.

What Does the ROCE Trend For Henan Liliang Diamond Tell Us?
-----------------------------------------------------------

On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Henan Liliang Diamond doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 18%, but since then they've fallen to 3.9%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.

On a related note, Henan Liliang Diamond has decreased its current liabilities to 13% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.

The Bottom Line On Henan Liliang Diamond's ROCE
-----------------------------------------------

In summary, Henan Liliang Diamond is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And in the last three years, the stock has given away 45% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.
