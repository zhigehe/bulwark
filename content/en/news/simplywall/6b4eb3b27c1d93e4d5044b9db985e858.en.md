[So-Young International (NasdaqGM:SY)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-sy/so-young-international)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Financial Health Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** So-Young International Inc. operates an online platform for consumption healthcare services in the People’s Republic of China and has a market cap of approximately $90.45 million.

**Operations:** The company's revenue primarily comes from its operations in China, amounting to CN¥1.49 billion.

**Market Cap:** $90.45M

So-Young International Inc. presents a mixed picture for penny stock investors. The company has maintained stable short-term financial health, with assets exceeding liabilities and more cash than debt. However, its earnings growth of 1.4% over the past year lags behind industry averages, despite surpassing its five-year average decline of 30.1%. Recent earnings show improved profitability with net income rising to CN¥20.35 million in Q3 2024 from CN¥18.31 million a year ago, yet revenue guidance suggests a potential decrease ahead. The stock trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 19.4x compared to peers but remains highly volatile.

Its cash runway is less than a year, indicating potential financial strain if current cash flow trends persist. The management and board are experienced, with average tenures of 7.8 and 14.2 years respectively, yet the company continues to be unprofitable with increasing losses over five years at an annual rate of 39.5%. Additionally, its share price is highly volatile compared to most U.S stocks.
