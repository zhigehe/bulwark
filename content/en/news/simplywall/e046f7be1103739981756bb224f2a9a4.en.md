The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that **Cencosud Shopping S.A.** ([SNSE:CENCOMALLS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/cl/real-estate-management-and-development/snse-cencomalls/cencosud-shopping-shares)) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt A Problem?
-----------------------

Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.

What Is Cencosud Shopping's Net Debt?
-------------------------------------

As you can see below, at the end of September 2024, Cencosud Shopping had CL$728.7b of debt, up from CL$696.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of CL$194.0b, its net debt is less, at about CL$534.7b.

SNSE:CENCOMALLS Debt to Equity History February 7th 2025

A Look At Cencosud Shopping's Liabilities
-----------------------------------------

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Cencosud Shopping had liabilities of CL$114.7b falling due within a year, and liabilities of CL$1.36t due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of CL$194.0b and CL$19.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by CL$1.26t.

This deficit isn't so bad because Cencosud Shopping is worth CL$2.90t, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.

In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).

We'd say that Cencosud Shopping's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.9), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 1k times, makes us even more comfortable. Cencosud Shopping grew its EBIT by 8.1% in the last year. Whilst that hardly knocks our socks off it is a positive when it comes to debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Cencosud Shopping's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Cencosud Shopping recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View
--------

Cencosud Shopping's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Cencosud Shopping takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
