As global markets navigate a landscape marked by rate cuts from the ECB and SNB, and expectations of further easing by the Fed, small-cap stocks have faced challenges with the Russell 2000 Index underperforming against larger indices.

In such an environment, a good stock might be characterized by strong fundamentals and potential for growth that isn't yet fully recognized by the broader market.
