Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding *base* of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at **Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste S. A. B. de C. V's** ([BMV:ASURB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/mx/transportation/bmv-asur-b/grupo-aeroportuario-del-sureste-s-a-b-de-c-v-shares)) look very promising so lets take a look.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
------------------------------------------

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste S. A. B. de C. V is:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.23 = Mex$17b รท (Mex$78b - Mex$5.1b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Therefore, **Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste S. A. B. de C. V has an ROCE of 23%.** While that is an outstanding return, the rest of the Infrastructure industry generates similar returns, on average.
