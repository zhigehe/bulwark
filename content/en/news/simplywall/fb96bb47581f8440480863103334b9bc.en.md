The analysts might have been a bit too bullish on **Electronics Mart India Limited** ([NSE:EMIL](https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/retail/nse-emil/electronics-mart-india-shares)), given that the company fell short of expectations when it released its quarterly results last week. It wasn't a great result overall - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at ₹19b, statutory earnings missed forecasts by an incredible 41%, coming in at just ₹0.82 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.

NSEI:EMIL Earnings and Revenue Growth February 13th 2025

Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Electronics Mart India from five analysts is for revenues of ₹81.9b in 2026. If met, it would imply a huge 21% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 34% to ₹5.89. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of ₹83.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹6.62 in 2026. The analysts seem less optimistic after the recent results, reducing their revenue forecasts and making a real cut to earnings per share numbers.

It'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 16% to ₹202. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Electronics Mart India, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at ₹239 and the most bearish at ₹180 per share. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Electronics Mart India is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the [industry](https://simplywall.st/markets/in/consumer-discretionary/specialty-stores). The period to the end of 2026 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 16% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 16% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry (in aggregate), which analyst estimates suggest will see revenues grow 21% annually. So although Electronics Mart India is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line
---------------

The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.

Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.
