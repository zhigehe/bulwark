If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's *amount* of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, **OPUS GLOBAL Nyrt** ([BUSE:OPUS](https://simplywall.st/stocks/hu/capital-goods/buse-opus/opus-global-nyrt-shares)) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?
----------------------------------------------

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for OPUS GLOBAL Nyrt, this is the formula:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.053 = Ft41b รท (Ft1.0t - Ft257b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

So, **OPUS GLOBAL Nyrt has an ROCE of 5.3%.**  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Industrials industry average of 7.4%.
