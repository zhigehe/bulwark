The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the **Analyst I.M.S. Investment Management Services Ltd** ([TLV:ANLT](https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/diversified-financials/tase-anlt/analyst-ims-investment-management-services-shares)) share price has soared 234% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 84% over the last quarter.

Since it's been a strong week for Analyst I.M.S. Investment Management Services shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During five years of share price growth, Analyst I.M.S. Investment Management Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 27% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.

TASE:ANLT Earnings Per Share Growth February 11th 2025

Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of [historic growth trends, available here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/diversified-financials/tase-anlt/analyst-ims-investment-management-services-shares/past).

What About Dividends?
---------------------

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Analyst I.M.S. Investment Management Services, it has a TSR of 278% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective
-----------------------

We're pleased to report that Analyst I.M.S. Investment Management Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 137% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 30% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.
