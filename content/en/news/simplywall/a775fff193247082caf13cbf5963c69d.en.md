Some **Insmed Incorporated** ([NASDAQ:INSM](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-insm/insmed)) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the President, William Lewis, recently sold a substantial US$6.4m worth of stock at a price of US$80.90 per share. That's a big disposal, and it decreased their holding size by 13%, which is notable but not too bad.

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Insmed
----------------------------------------------------

Notably, that recent sale by William Lewis is the biggest insider sale of Insmed shares that we've seen in the last year. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$79.95. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Insmed insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Insmed Boast High Insider Ownership?
-----------------------------------------

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insmed insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$123m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Insmed Insiders?
-----------------------------------------------------

Insiders sold Insmed shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.
