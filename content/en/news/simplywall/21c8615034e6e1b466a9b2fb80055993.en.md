If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing *return* on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's *amount* of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at **Twim** ([KOSDAQ:290090](https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/software/kosdaq-a290090/twim-shares)) so let's look a bit deeper.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?
----------------------------------------------

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Twim, this is the formula:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.045 = ₩3.0b ÷ (₩75b - ₩8.7b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)*.

Thus, **Twim has an ROCE of 4.5%.**  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 5.5% average generated by the Software industry.

What Does the ROCE Trend For Twim Tell Us?
------------------------------------------

Twim has recently broken into profitability so their prior investments seem to be paying off. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 4.5% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 55% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.

The Bottom Line
---------------

Overall, Twim gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. And since the stock has fallen 52% over the last three years, there might be an opportunity here. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.
