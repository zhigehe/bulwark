David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that **IBC Advanced Alloys Corp.** ([CVE:IB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-ib/ibc-advanced-alloys-shares)) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

When Is Debt A Problem?
-----------------------

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

What Is IBC Advanced Alloys's Net Debt?
---------------------------------------

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that IBC Advanced Alloys had US$12.9m of debt in September 2024, down from US$13.9m, one year before. However, it does have US$989.0k in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$11.9m.

TSXV:IB Debt to Equity History February 8th 2025

How Strong Is IBC Advanced Alloys' Balance Sheet?
-------------------------------------------------

Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that IBC Advanced Alloys had liabilities of US$12.8m due within 12 months and liabilities of US$4.78m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$989.0k in cash and US$2.33m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$14.3m.

The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$6.75m company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, IBC Advanced Alloys would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.

In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.

While IBC Advanced Alloys's debt to EBITDA ratio (4.1) suggests that it uses some debt, its interest cover is very weak, at 1.1, suggesting high leverage. So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately. More concerning, IBC Advanced Alloys saw its EBIT drop by 8.0% in the last twelve months. If it keeps going like that paying off its debt will be like running on a treadmill -- a lot of effort for not much advancement. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since IBC Advanced Alloys will need earnings to service that debt. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out [this graph of its long term earnings trend](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-ib/ibc-advanced-alloys-shares/past).

Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last two years, IBC Advanced Alloys produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 70% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.

Our View
--------

On the face of it, IBC Advanced Alloys's interest cover left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But on the bright side, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. We're quite clear that we consider IBC Advanced Alloys to be really rather risky, as a result of its balance sheet health. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot.
