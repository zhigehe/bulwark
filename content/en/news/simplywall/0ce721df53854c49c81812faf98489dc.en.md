It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.

Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like **Park & Bellheimer** ([FRA:PKB](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/fra-pkb/park-bellheimer-shares)). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Park & Bellheimer with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

Park & Bellheimer's Improving Profits
-------------------------------------

Park & Bellheimer has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Over the last year, Park & Bellheimer increased its EPS from €0.36 to €0.40. That's a fair increase of 9.1%.

Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Park & Bellheimer remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 5.8% to €25m. That's encouraging news for the company!

Park & Bellheimer isn't a huge company, given its market capitalisation of €12m. That makes it extra important to check on its [balance sheet strength](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/fra-pkb/park-bellheimer-shares/health).

Are Park & Bellheimer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Theory would suggest that it's an encouraging sign to see high insider ownership of a company, since it ties company performance directly to the financial success of its management. So as you can imagine, the fact that Park & Bellheimer insiders own a significant number of shares certainly is appealing. Indeed, with a collective holding of 81%, company insiders are in control and have plenty of capital behind the venture. This should be seen as a good thing, as it means insiders have a personal interest in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. Although, with Park & Bellheimer being valued at €12m, this is a small company we're talking about. So this large proportion of shares owned by insiders only amounts to €9.3m. That might not be a huge sum but it should be enough to keep insiders motivated!
