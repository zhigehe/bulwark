**SSH Group Limited** ([ASX:SSH](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/commercial-services/asx-ssh/ssh-group-shares)) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 38% after a shaky period beforehand. Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 37% over that time.

In spite of the firm bounce in price, considering around half the companies operating in Australia's Commercial Services industry have price-to-sales ratios (or "P/S") above 1.6x, you may still consider SSH Group as an solid investment opportunity with its 0.2x P/S ratio. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

ASX:SSH Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 10th 2025

### What Does SSH Group's Recent Performance Look Like?

For instance, SSH Group's receding revenue in recent times would have to be some food for thought. One possibility is that the P/S is low because investors think the company won't do enough to avoid underperforming the broader industry in the near future. Those who are bullish on SSH Group will be hoping that this isn't the case so that they can pick up the stock at a lower valuation.

Want the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then our [**free** report on SSH Group](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/commercial-services/asx-ssh/ssh-group-shares/past) will help you shine a light on its historical performance.

How Is SSH Group's Revenue Growth Trending?
-------------------------------------------

There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like SSH Group's to be considered reasonable.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 2.7% decrease to the company's top line. This means it has also seen a slide in revenue over the longer-term as revenue is down 43% in total over the last three years. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.

In contrast to the company, the rest of the industry is expected to grow by 4.2% over the next year, which really puts the company's recent medium-term revenue decline into perspective.

In light of this, it's understandable that SSH Group's P/S would sit below the majority of other companies. However, we think shrinking revenues are unlikely to lead to a stable P/S over the longer term, which could set up shareholders for future disappointment. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as recent revenue trends are already weighing down the shares.

The Bottom Line On SSH Group's P/S
----------------------------------

Despite SSH Group's share price climbing recently, its P/S still lags most other companies. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.

Our examination of SSH Group confirms that the company's shrinking revenue over the past medium-term is a key factor in its low price-to-sales ratio, given the industry is projected to grow. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.
