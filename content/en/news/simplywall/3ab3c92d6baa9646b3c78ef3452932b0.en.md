[Tsumura (TSE:4540)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4540/tsumura-shares)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simply Wall St Dividend Rating:** ★★★★☆☆

**Overview:** Tsumura & Co. manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products from plant-derived crude drugs in Japan and internationally, with a market cap of ¥331.10 billion.

**Operations:** Tsumura & Co. generates revenue primarily from its pharmaceutical products segment, amounting to ¥171.79 billion.

**Dividend Yield:** 3.1%

Tsumura's dividend payments have been stable and reliable over the past decade, though its 3.08% yield is lower than top-tier dividend payers in Japan. Despite a low payout ratio of 33%, dividends aren't well covered by free cash flow due to a high cash payout ratio of 174.4%. Recent guidance revisions show improved profit forecasts, with earnings expected to grow annually by 6.14%, supporting potential future dividend sustainability amidst current valuation below fair value estimates.
