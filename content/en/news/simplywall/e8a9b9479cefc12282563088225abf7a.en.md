For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.

Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like **Dollarama** ([TSE:DOL](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/retail/tsx-dol/dollarama-shares)). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.

Dollarama's Earnings Per Share Are Growing
------------------------------------------

The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Dollarama has grown EPS by 26% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up *that* sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Dollarama maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 8.3% to CA$6.2b. That's encouraging news for the company!

Are Dollarama Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
-----------------------------------------------------

We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a CA$39b company like Dollarama. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth CA$564m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.

Does Dollarama Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?
------------------------------------------------

If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Dollarama's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Dollarama's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value.
