Today is shaping up negative for **SYZYGY AG** ([ETR:SYZ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/media/etr-syz/syzygy-shares)) shareholders, with the analysts delivering a substantial negative revision to next year's forecasts. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon.

After the downgrade, the consensus from SYZYGY's dual analysts is for revenues of €66m in 2025, which would reflect a small 5.8% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to soar 51% to €0.27. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €75m and earnings per share (EPS) of €0.32 in 2025. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a considerable drop in earnings per share numbers as well.

XTRA:SYZ Earnings and Revenue Growth February 7th 2025

It'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 5.6% to €6.80.

Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 4.7% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 4.3% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 4.8% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - SYZYGY is expected to lag the wider industry.

The Bottom Line
---------------

The biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for SYZYGY. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that SYZYGY's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. After such a stark change in sentiment from analysts, we'd understand if readers now felt a bit wary of SYZYGY.

With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At least one analyst has provided forecasts out to 2027, which can be seen for free  [on our platform here.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/media/etr-syz/syzygy-shares/past)
