Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of **Amber Enterprises India** ([NSE:AMBER](https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-amber/amber-enterprises-india-shares)) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)
-----------------------------------------------

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amber Enterprises India:

**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**

0.14 = ₹4.7b ÷ (₹64b - ₹30b) *(Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024)*.

So, **Amber Enterprises India has an ROCE of 14%.**  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Durables industry average of 11% it's much better.

What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
----------------------------------

While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 133% in that time. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amber Enterprises India has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.

Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 47% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than14% because total capital employed would be higher.The 14% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 47% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. Additionally, this high level of current liabilities isn't ideal because it means the company's suppliers (or short-term creditors) are effectively funding a large portion of the business.

The Bottom Line On Amber Enterprises India's ROCE
-------------------------------------------------

To sum it up, Amber Enterprises India has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 314% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more "expensive" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.
