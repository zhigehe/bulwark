**Lifco AB (publ)** ([STO:LIFCO B](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-lifco-b/lifco-shares)) shareholders have had their patience rewarded with a 28% share price jump in the last month. The last 30 days bring the annual gain to a very sharp 48%.

Since its price has surged higher, Lifco may be sending very bearish signals at the moment with a price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 55.3x, since almost half of all companies in Sweden have P/E ratios under 23x and even P/E's lower than 14x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.

Lifco could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

OM:LIFCO B Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry February 14th 2025

 Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our [**free** report on Lifco](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-lifco-b/lifco-shares/future) will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

How Is Lifco's Growth Trending?
-------------------------------

Lifco's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.

Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any earnings per share growth to speak of for the company over the past year. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 38% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its uninspiring short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% each year as estimated by the five analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 21% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.

In light of this, it's alarming that Lifco's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.

The Key Takeaway
----------------

The strong share price surge has got Lifco's P/E rushing to great heights as well. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

We've established that Lifco currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.

And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted  [**1 warning sign for Lifco**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-lifco-b/lifco-shares)  you should know about.
