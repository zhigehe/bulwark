As global markets navigate through a period marked by tariff uncertainties and mixed economic indicators, investors are increasingly focused on identifying opportunities amidst the volatility. With major indices like the S&P 500 experiencing slight declines and manufacturing activity showing signs of expansion, there is a growing interest in stocks that may be trading below their intrinsic value. In such an environment, understanding what makes a stock undervalued—such as strong earnings performance relative to market expectations—can be crucial for investors looking to capitalize on potential discounts.

Let's review some notable picks from our screened stocks.

[Nordic Waterproofing Holding (OM:NWG)](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-nwg/nordic-waterproofing-holding-shares)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overview:** Nordic Waterproofing Holding AB (publ) develops, manufactures, and distributes waterproofing products and services for buildings and infrastructure across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, the rest of Europe, and internationally with a market cap of approximately SEK4.38 billion.

**Operations:** The company's revenue is primarily derived from its Products & Solutions segment, which accounts for SEK3.06 billion, and Installation Services, contributing SEK1.18 billion.

**Estimated Discount To Fair Value:** 38.9%

Nordic Waterproofing Holding is trading 38.9% below its estimated fair value of SEK 298.36, with earnings forecast to grow significantly at 29.1% annually, surpassing the Swedish market's growth rate.
