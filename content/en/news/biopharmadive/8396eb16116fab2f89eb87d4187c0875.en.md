Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as one of the most promising advancements in precision oncology, combining targeted delivery with the potency of traditional chemotherapies. Over the last decade, ADCs have gained significant traction, with more therapies being approved and a rapidly expanding development pipeline. While the therapeutic promise of ADCs is clear, success in this space depends on more than just the drug itself—it relies heavily on precise and reliable diagnostic testing.

In our latest white paper, Antibody-Drug Conjugates: Precision Therapeutics Powered by Diagnostic Innovation, we take a closer look at the science behind ADCs and the critical role diagnostics play in their development and clinical success.

Why Diagnostics Matter for ADCs

At their core, ADCs work by targeting specific antigens expressed on cancer cells. While this targeted approach offers significant advantages, it also introduces new challenges. Identifying the right antigens, validating their expression, and ensuring patients are appropriately selected for therapy requires advanced diagnostic tools. This is where technologies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) come into play.

From preclinical research to regulatory approval and clinical adoption, diagnostic testing underpins every stage of ADC development. For pharmaceutical companies, collaboration with a strong diagnostic partner is essential—one who can navigate the complexities of antigen validation, assay development, and real-world clinical testing.

A Growing Need for Innovation

As the ADC field evolves, the biomarker landscape is becoming more complex. Emerging targets such as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and neoantigens hold promise for increasing therapeutic precision but require increasingly sophisticated diagnostic solutions. This growing complexity highlights the need for seamless integration of diagnostics into ADC development programs to ensure these therapies reach the right patients.

How Quest Diagnostics Supports ADC Programs

In the white paper, we highlight how Quest Diagnostics and its PhenoPath Laboratories division provide end-to-end diagnostic support tailored to the needs of ADC developers. With decades of experience in IHC assay development, regulatory expertise, and a nationwide clinical testing infrastructure, Quest is uniquely positioned to advance ADC programs from early research to clinical implementation.

Whether you’re exploring novel targets or scaling companion diagnostics to market, having the right diagnostic partner can make the difference in bringing ADCs to patients safely and effectively.
