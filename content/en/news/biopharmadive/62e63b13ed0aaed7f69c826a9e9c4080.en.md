**ZUG, Switzerland —** 

**ZUG, SWITZERLAND, 30 January 2025 —** PSI CRO AG, a global Swiss-based CRO, has announced completing 2024 with commendable operational and financial results, reaching its revenue goals exactly as planned and demonstrating a **15% growth over the previous year**. PSI is the only fully independent and privately owned CRO of its size. Currently, the company reports 3,000 full-time employees in 56 countries. **2025 will be PSI’s 30th year in business.**

PSI is recognized as a remarkably stable CRO in an industry known for its unpredictability. Since the company’s establishment in 1995 in Switzerland, PSI has remained entirely independent, always growing organically, with the unchanging management team focused on solving the industry’s biggest and largely unaddressed problem of poor patient enrollment.

“For every study protocol that comes across our desk we need to examine and address a variety of intrinsic circumstances that are prone to affect patient enrollment. Only by learning to see and predict the many inconspicuous factors affecting enrollment by country, by region, by county, by state, by site, can we speak of the ability to operationalize effective enrollment strategies. I am proud to say that we are getting better and better at that,” says Nick Sinackevich, PSI’s President. “In our quest for enabling predictable enrollment of studies of any size and complexity, we made substantial progress with putting in place multilayered site support systems and establishing indication-specific referral networks,” adds Sinackevich.

2024 was the year in which PSI’s key operational differentiator – **on-time project delivery – remained above 90%.**

PSI additionally reported their staff turnover rate dropped to a single-digit number of 9% globally, a sign of unwavering stability and robust corporate culture.
