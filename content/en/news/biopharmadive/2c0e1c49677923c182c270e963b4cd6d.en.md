Initial public offerings make the biotechnology industry tick. Stock listings give young companies the funding they need to develop their drugs, and their venture backers an opportunity to earn a return.

For much of the past decade, biotechs found Wall Street receptive to their pitches. Public investment, drawn in by scientific advances and company successes, bolstered generations of new drugmakers.

IPO activity reached a peak in 2021, when more than 100 biotechs priced an initial offering and together raised nearly $15 billion. But that momentum came to a halt in 2022 as stock prices of newly public companies plummeted amid a sector-wide downturn. The pace of IPOs stalled and, last year, only 24 drugmakers priced initial share sales.


Emerging biotechs now face a tougher road to public markets. Which will make it? Which create value and which fail? What types of companies earn the best returns? Who are their investors?
