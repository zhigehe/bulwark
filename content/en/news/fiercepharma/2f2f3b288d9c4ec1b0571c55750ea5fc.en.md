If Fierce Pharma Marketing’s annual list of the top 10 biggest potential drug launches of the coming year is any indication, biopharma may soon be in for a blockbuster boom. All together, the 10 meds that made the 2025 list stand to generate a whopping $29 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade.

In this week’s episode of The Top Line, we dig into the report’s predictions. Fierce’s Andrea Park and Eric Sagonowsky take a deep dive into the top three drugs on the list—all of which had already snagged their first FDA approvals by this episode’s release—and highlight some of the prevailing trends from past years’ reports, including repeat entries, popular indications and drugs that never had the chance to meet their predicted potential.
