Outcrop Silver & Gold on Thursday said its board approved the adoption of an amendment to change its 10% rolling stock option plan to a fixed number plan.

The company could grant stock options to buy up to 10% of the issued shares at the time of the grant, under the 10% rolling stock option plan, but the amendment changes the number of common shares reserved for issuance from treasury under the revised fixed stock option plan to 34.2 million.

At the annual general and special meeting of shareholders to be held on Feb. 14, shareholders will be asked to ratify and approve the revised fixed stock option plan, including the new limit for issuance to insiders under the option plan, and any other share compensation arrangement.

Shares of the company were last seen up $0.01 at $0.25 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
