TruBridge said Tuesday that it signed cooperation agreements with Pinetree Capital, L6 Holdings, as well as with family office Ocho Investments that includes appointing Jerry Canada and Dris Upitis to its board of directors.

The company said Canada was formerly group president of Harris Computer, which is a unit of Constellation Software, and Upitis is head of Ocho Investments.

TruBridge also said its shareholders will be asked at its annual 2025 meeting to approve a proposal to declassify the board. If the proposal is approved, the company said its directors will stand for election to one-year terms at the 2026 annual meeting.

TBRG shares were over 1% higher ahead of Tuesday's opening bell.
