Biorem shares were last seen up 10% after the company on Tuesday said it received new orders totaling more than $8 million for its air emission abatement technologies, while saying it does not expect existing or new U.S. tariffs to cut into its business.

The company said an analysis of its global supply chains is complete and it "does not expect that potential tariffs in North America will have any material impact on the operations" or financial performance of the company.

In early December, the company's order backlog had grown to approximately $58 million; that number has grown to over $60 million.

"Amid all of the trade uncertainties of recent weeks, the new year has started with robust sales and bidding activity," said chief executive Derek Webb. "Our backlog continues to grow; driven largely by the new products and services we have introduced over the past few years.

The company's shares were last seen up $0.26 to $2.84 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
