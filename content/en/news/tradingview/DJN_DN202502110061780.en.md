Business groups in Canada point to conflicting data on the back of Ottawa's two-month sales tax holiday, which comes to an end mid-month. The not-for-profit Restaurants Canada estimates employment in the foodservice sector rose in January to the highest level since the start of the pandemic. The industry added 34,600 new jobs since November, reaching 1.18 million jobs and representing one in six new jobs created in Canada as the tax break offered support to households during an ongoing affordability crisis, Restaurants Canada CEO Kelly Higginson says. Still, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says only 5% of small businesses saw stronger sales compared with the same period last year. Of that it says 4% of businesses in retail and 15% in hospitality saw sales rise. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)
