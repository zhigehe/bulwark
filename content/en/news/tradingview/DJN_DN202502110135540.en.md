The Singapore dollar strengthens slightly against its U.S. counterpart in the Asian trading session amid risk-on sentiment from gains across most regional equity markets. However, the downside on the greenback may be limited, with trade uncertainty persisting, MUFG Bank's Lloyd Chan says in a research report.
