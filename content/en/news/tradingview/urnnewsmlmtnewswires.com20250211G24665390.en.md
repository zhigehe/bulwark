Airbus delivered an unpainted aircraft to China's Tianjin municipality from France, making it the Asian country's first Airbus aircraft for the year, according to Xinhua on Tuesday, citing the European aircraft maker.

The Airbus A350 aircraft, which was already assembled overseas, will go through the final cabin installation, and will be painted and tested at the Airbus Tianjin Widebody Completion and Delivery Center before being sent to the client, the report said.

George Xu, Airbus executive vice president and Airbus China's chief executive officer, said Airbus' Chinese market jumped to 50% today from around 20% in 2008. This year will be the 40th anniversary of Airbus partnering with China, the report said.
