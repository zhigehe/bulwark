India's benchmark 10-year government bond remains the top choice after last week's rate cut amid hopes of further central bank bond buys, although shorter-duration debt is expected to become more attractive next quarter, an executive at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management said on Monday.

With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to provide liquidity through more open market operations (OMO) and/or foreign exchange (FX) swaps, the 10-year is likely to trade in the 6.55%-6.75% band until March, Deepak Agrawal, chief investment officer - fixed income, told Reuters Trading India.

The fund house manages 1.68 trillion rupees ($19.19 billion) of debt assets.

"Since RBI is doing OMOs, we currently prefer 10-year security, with incremental OMOs expected. Post further rate cuts and liquidity in the system, we would prefer shorter-end of the curve (like) 5-year."

Agrawal expects the bond yield curve to steepen and sees the shorter-end falling by about 20-25 basis points (bps) in the April-June quarter.

The RBI has already poured over 1.50 trillion rupees into the banking system over the last month through open market purchases of bonds, a 56-day repo, FX swaps, and by buying bonds in the secondary market.

It will purchase 200 billion rupees of bonds each this week and the next.

Agrawal expects the RBI to infuse another 750 billion-1 trillion rupees of durable liquidity after it completes its third OMO auction next week and before the end of this financial year that ends in March.

"We continue to expect further liquidity injection either through OMOs or one more FX swap."

He sees the RBI delivering another 25-bp rate cut by June but said a 50-bp reduction is on the cards if GDP growth continues to lag.

In the corporate bond space, Agrawal finds the two- to five-year part of the curve attractive, amid bets of more rate cuts and liquidity infusion, with these bonds also providing a decent carry trade opportunity.
