Fort Lauderdale, FL, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — MARA Holdings, Inc. (“MARA” or the “Company”), a global leader in leveraging digital asset compute to support the energy transformation, today announced that its Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”), which was originally scheduled to be held on February 11, 2025, has been postponed. The Special Meeting is now scheduled to be held virtually, via live webcast at *web.lumiconnect.com/266814323*, on Wednesday, February 19, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. PST / 11:30 a.m. EST. The record date for the Special Meeting, January 17, 2025, is unchanged and applies to the postponed Special Meeting.

The Special Meeting has been postponed to provide the Company’s stockholders with additional time to vote in order to facilitate broader participation. The Company’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposals identified in the Company’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting. Stockholders who have already cast their votes do not need to take any action, unless they wish to change or revoke their prior proxy or voting instructions, and their votes will be counted at the postponed Special Meeting. For stockholders who have not yet cast their votes, we urge them to vote their shares now, so they can be tabulated prior to the postponed Special Meeting.
