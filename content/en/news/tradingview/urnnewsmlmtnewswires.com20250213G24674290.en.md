RBC Capital Markets on Thursday reiterated its outperform rating on Nestlé after the Swiss food and beverage company's 2024 results beat consensus while the confirmed outlook for the year ahead matched expectations.

Underlying EPS and sales for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2024, decreased year over year to 4.77 francs and 91.35 billion francs but still exceeded the consensus of 4.6 francs and 91 billion francs, respectively. The analysts attributed the profit beat to a slight decline in marketing spend in the second half.

The company affirmed its outlook for 2025, expecting an annual improvement in organic sales growth, compared with the consensus of a 3.1% increase.

"We think that Nestlé's problems have been as much to do with expectations management as operational management. The fresh CEO/CFO combination seems determined to put that right."

The price target on the stock is 93 francs.
