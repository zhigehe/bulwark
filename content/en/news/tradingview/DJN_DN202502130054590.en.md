EssilorLuxottica's confirmation of midterm margin guidance casts doubts, UBS analysts write in a research note. The Ray-Ban maker maintained expectations of mid-single-digit annual revenue growth through 2026 at constant exchange rates. It also targets an adjusted operating margin between 19% and 20% by the end of that period.
