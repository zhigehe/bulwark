Redbook US same-store sales rose by 5.3% from a year earlier in the week ended Feb. 8, slower than a 5.7% year-over-year increase in the previous week.

Redbook noted sales mainly driven by Super Bowl Sunday related items, snack foods, beverages and team apparel. Retailers are focused on selling spring items at full prices with fewer products in clearance sales.

Through the first selling week for February, sales were up 5.3% compared with February 2024, well below the target for a 6.3% gain, Redbook said.
