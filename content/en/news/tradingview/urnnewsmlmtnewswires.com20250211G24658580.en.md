BofA Global Research said Europe may be next in US President Donald Trump's tariffs game, adding that it expects "a moderate increase" and a benign final outcome that could weigh on global investment.

With an announcement expected soon, analysts expect the Trump administration to cite a nearly $240 billion trade deficit between the EU and the US as a factor for the increased tariffs. Encouraging European companies to produce more US-made cars and making member states boost their defense budget are also some of the biggest reasons that BofA expects the administration to say, according to the Feb. 7 note.

The research firm, however, said a trade war may be mitigated if the US administration shifts its focus on economic growth at home. On the other hand, fiscal challenges and doubts over the tariff threats' credibility could escalate tension.

"Another risk is that the Trump Administration views trade deficits as fundamentally problematic, and tariffs as the best or most expedient way to address the issue. In this case, the trade war could escalate well beyond our forecast," analysts said.
