Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing posted NT$293.29 billion revenue in January, up 5.4% from a month prior, despite losses following an earthquake on Jan. 21.

The revenue surged 35.9% year over year, according to a Monday filing with the Taiwan Exchange.

A 6.4-magnitude earthquake caused wafer losses, prompting TSMC to lower its first-quarter revenue forecast to the lower end of its $25 billion to $25.8 billion guidance.

The company estimates NT$5.3 billion in earthquake-related losses but maintains its gross profit margin outlook at 57% to 59%.

Despite the setback, the chip maker reaffirmed its full-year outlook and is working to recover lost production, it noted.
