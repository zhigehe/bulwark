VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **GoldHaven Resources Corp.** ("**GoldHaven**" or the "**Company**") (OTCQB: GHVNF) (FSE: 4QS) is pleased to announce it has closed its previously announced non-brokered private placement of units of the Company (“Units”). The Company issued an aggregate of 6,141,303 Units at a price of $0.25 per Unit for gross proceeds of approximately $1,535,325, with each Unit comprised of one common share of the Company (a “Common Share”) and one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”, and collectively, the “Offering”). Each Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Common Share (each, a “Warrant Share”) at a price of $0.50 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.

Insider participation included Bonn Smith, CEO & President for 360,000 Units and Sead Hamzagic, CFO for 400,000 Units. Such participation is considered to be a “related party transaction” as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of any Units issued to, or the consideration paid by, such persons will exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization.

All securities issued in connection with the Offering are subject to a hold period of four months and one day pursuant to applicable securities laws. In connection with the Offering, the Company issued 111,230 non-transferable broker warrants, with each broker warrant exercisable to acquire one Common Share at a price of $0.50 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance, and paid cash finder’s fees in the aggregate amount of $27,807.50.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for exploration expenditures, administrative expenses and general working capital.
