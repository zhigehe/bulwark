Hong Kong stocks surged 376 points or 1.7% to 22,196 in Friday's morning session, recovering from slight losses in the previous session amid broad sector gains.

Markets reached their highest level in over four months, on track for a fifth consecutive weekly gain, up around 5.0% so far.

This upturn was driven by signals from China's central bank indicating plans to ease monetary policy when appropriate to support an economy facing growing domestic and external challenges.
