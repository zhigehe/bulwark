**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Healthcare Services Group reported:

* Net income of $11.9 million, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, inclusive of new business start-up costs.
* Cash flow from operations was $36.2 million; however, after adjusting for the $9.2 million increase in payroll accrual, the actual cash flow from operations was $27.0 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The company’s revenue was driven by its two main segments:

* Housekeeping & laundry: $192.7 million in revenue with a margin of 10.2%.
* Dining & nutrition: $245.1 million in revenue with a margin of 4.7%.

Cost of services was reported at $379.2 million, inclusive of new business start-up costs, and the company aims to manage this cost in the 86% range for 2025. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $44.8 million, with a goal to reduce this to the 8.5% to 9.5% range in 2025.

In 2024 alone, the company repurchased over $5.0 million of its common stock, including $1.0 million during the fourth quarter. The company has 6.0 million shares remaining under its authorization.

**Management's Perspective**

Ted Wahl, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2024 was a transitional year for HCSG, as it marked a pivotal shift from recovery to renewed growth. This shift was highlighted by our Q4 results and the positive momentum we’re carrying into the new year. Looking ahead, we are confident that continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, supported by our strong business fundamentals, will enable us to further accelerate growth, enhance profitability, and maximize cash flow through 2025 and beyond.”
