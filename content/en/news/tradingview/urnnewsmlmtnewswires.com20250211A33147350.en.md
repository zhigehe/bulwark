Walt Disney is revising its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs as it seeks to prioritize business outcomes, news website Axios reported Tuesday, citing a memo sent by the entertainment and media company to its employees.

The shift in DEI efforts includes moving and changing the content disclaimers introduced in 2020 for select titles, the report said, citing unnamed sources.

The move underscores the pressure on brands to align with the expectations under the Trump administration, the report said.

Disney did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.
