The Tadawul All Share Index ended Tuesday lower at 0.38% in the red as the newly imposed 25% tariffs on US steel and aluminum imports weighed on investor sentiment.

The Saudi bourse closed at 12,424.32 points, with 69 shares in the green and 155 in the red. Raoom Trading (SASE:4144) was the top gainer at 5.59%, and Tihama for Advertising, Public Relations and Marketing Co. (SASE:4070) was the stock that lost the most at 3.40%.

In international news, the European Union is preparing to counteract US President Donald Trump's plan to impose a 25% tariff on US imports of aluminum and steel. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the tariffs were "unjustified" and "bad for business."

Back at home, Saudi Arabia's domestic cement dispatches for January grew 9.1% year over year. The kingdom shipped 4.9 million tons of cement in the reporting month, up from 4.5 million tons a year ago.
