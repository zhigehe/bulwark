Sugar futures traded above 19.7 cents per pound, retreating from a mid-December high of 19.89 cents due to lower demand.

The USDA's latest WASDE report projects US sugar consumption for the 2024/25 season to decline to 12.48 million short tons, marking the third consecutive annual decrease.

Despite this, US sugar production remains strong at 9.37 million ST, slightly below previous forecasts but still higher than last season's 9.31 million ST. The report also indicated a significant reduction in sugar imports, projected to fall to 2.89 million ST from 3.81 million ST last season.

These changes reflect shifts in both domestic demand and global trade dynamics.

Meanwhile, India, the worldâ€™s second-largest sugar producer, has exported 500,000 metric tons this season, though its export pace is slowing.

In Brazil, the 2025/26 center-south sugar production is expected to rise 8.5% to 43.3 million metric tons, contributing to global supply projections.
