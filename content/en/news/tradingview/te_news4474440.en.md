Germany’s 10-year Bund yield rose to 2.4%, recovering from a 5-week low, as concerns over trade and economic growth weighed on sentiment.

The EU vowed to retaliate against US tariffs on European steel and aluminum, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calling them "unjustified" and promising firm countermeasures.

US President Donald Trump on Monday ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.

Also, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that Europe would respond "within an hour" if tariffs were imposed.

Meanwhile, the ECB recently cut rates and hinted at further easing in March, with markets now expecting the deposit rate to fall to 1.87% by year-end.

In contrast, strong U.S. jobs data reinforced the Federal Reserve’s stance of keeping rates steady for now.
