**Overview**

**Pedro Azevedo, Chief Financial Officer, stated:** “Our second quarter continued the solid start to the year with mid-double digit sales growth, continued adjusted gross margin expansion driving a higher adjusted EBITDA, and demonstrating the underlying strength of the business.  With the risk of tariffs in the backdrop since the US election and especially given the events of last week, the decision to increase our US manufacturing presence was the right one.  During the past quarter, we have selected the new site and expect to begin production in late summer which will contribute to incremental sales.”

Soroush Nazarpour, President & Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Our second quarter results show our ability to perform and execute in a quickly evolving macro environment. We continue to build the company for the long term with a focus on creating value for all stakeholders. In the quarter we have made significant inroads in two key growth segments for our graphene products namely drilling fluid and insulation foam. We are finalizing plans for our large scale dry-processed graphene pilot plant in our Montreal facility with production planed by the end of 2025. Finally, our US expansion is well underway and could not be timelier given the specter of tariffs. Our financial situation is strong and gives us the agility to execute our near-term growth plans as well as on our 5-year strategic plan.”

\* ****Non-IFRS Measures****

The Corporation prepares its financial statements under IFRS. However, the Corporation considers certain non-IFRS financial measures as useful additional information in measuring the financial performance and condition of the Corporation. These measures, which the Corporation believes are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Corporation’s performance, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS measures include "Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted gross margin”.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of IFRS “Loss” to Non-IFRS “Adjusted EBITDA” and of IFRS “Gross margin” to Non-IFRS “Adjusted Gross margin” for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

**Revenues**

|  | Q2-2025 | Q2-2024 | Variation | | | Q1-2025 | Variation | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | $ | $ | $ | % | $ | $ |  | % |  |
| Revenues from customers | 32,636,947 | 28,559,390 | 4,077,557 | 14% | 33,327,069 | (690,122) |  | (2%) |  |

All revenues are coming from the segment of Advanced Materials, Plastics and Composite Products, except for $11,520 of other revenues [Q2-2024 – $4,228] from the Battery Cells and Materials segment.

Revenues from customers increased from $28,559,390 in Q2-2024 to $32,636,947 in Q2-2025. This increase is mainly due to higher tooling revenues and positive FX impact.

Other income decreased from $503,634 in Q2-2024 to $483,939 in Q2-2025. The variation is due to grants received for R&D programs.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

**1)** From Advanced Materials, Plastics and Composite Products

The adjusted EBITDA increased from $416,000 in Q2-2024 to $1,319,926 in Q2-2025. The variation is explained as follows:

* Adjusted Gross margin on revenues from customers increased by $1,423,708 compared to Q2-2024 due to higher sales as described above, favourable product mix, improved productivity and cost control;
* Partially offset by higher Selling, General & Administration and Research & Development expenses of $567,795 mainly due to timing of professional fees.

**2) From Battery Cells and Materials**

The adjusted EBITDA loss improved from a loss of $508,806 in Q2-2024 to a loss of $217,816 in Q2-2025. The variation is explained by the operational expenses decrease (Selling, General & Administration and Research & Development) of $283,638.

B. Results of operations variance analysis – six-month periods

**Revenues**

|  | YTD 2025 | YTD 2024 | Variation | | |

All revenues are coming from the segment of advanced materials, plastics and composite products, except for $41,341 of other income [YTD 2024 – $26,158] from the Battery Cells and Materials segment.

Revenues from customers increased from $57,266,142 in the last year period to $65,964,016 in the current period. This increase is mainly due to a higher volume, higher tooling revenues and a positive FX impact.

Other income increased from $732,913 in the last year period to $822,284 in the current period. The variation is due to grants received for R&D programs.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

1) From Advanced Materials, Plastics and Composite Products

The adjusted EBITDA increased from $586,654 in the last year period to $2,832,030 in the current period. The variation is explained as follows:

* Gross margin on revenues from customers increased by $2,721,575 compared to last year due to favourable product mix, improved productivity and cost control;
* Higher Other income of $89,371; and
* Partially offset by higher administrative expenses (Selling, General & Administration and Research & Development) of $625,387 mainly due to higher wages, including higher accrued variable compensation.

**2) From Battery Cells and Materials**

The adjusted EBITDA loss improved from a loss of $1,127,792 in the last year period to a loss of $605,681 in the current period. The variation is explained by lower administrative expenses (Selling, General & Administration and Research & Development) of $506,928.
