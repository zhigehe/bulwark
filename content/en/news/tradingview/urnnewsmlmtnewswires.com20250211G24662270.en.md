Foreign direct investment (FDI) into the Philippines slipped in November on year, but for the year-to-date, FDI is still running above 2023 levels, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reported Tuesday.

The Philippines logged FDI of $901 million in November, down 19.8% on year, said the central bank.

But for the year-to-date through November, the total FDI into the Philippines increased by 4.4% on year to $8.6 billion, added the nation's central bank.

FDI refers to investors in one nation actively buying or developing operating businesses or property of another nation. The term FDI generally excludes passive or portfolio investing in stocks and bonds.

FDI is generally considered a positive, as it can boost a nation's economic expansion through the additional expenditure capital on productive resources, and the transfer of technology.

FDI in 2024 has been particularly active in the Philippines manufacturing sector, which captured 72% of all FDI into the nation, on the year-to-date through November.

Real estate took 12% of FDI in 2024, wholesale and retail trade took 4%, and 12% was spread into other sectors, reported Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

By nation, in 2024 through November, the largest sources of FDI were Japan and the UK, each making up 39% of total funds, followed by the US, which made up 10% of FDI, and then Singapore, with 5% of FDI.
