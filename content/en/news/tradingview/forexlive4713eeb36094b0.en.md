There are a couple to take note of on the day, as highlighted in bold.

They are all for EUR/USD layered in between 1.0275 through to 1.0320. The expiries don't tie it with any major technical levels, so they're going to function on their own today. As things stand, Trump headlines are still driving markets to start the week. That is keeping the dollar slightly underpinned as a whole.

As such, with it likely being a quieter session in Europe again, the expiries should help to act as a lock for price action on either side to keep it close to the figure level until we get to US trading.

But just be mindful of comments from Paris, as US vice president Vance is to meet with China and the EU on the sidelines of the AI summit.
