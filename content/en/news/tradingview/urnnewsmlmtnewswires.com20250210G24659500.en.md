Marmota has expanded its follow-up drilling program for heavy mineral sands after encountering strong visual indications of mineralization in its Muckanippie project in South Australia, the company said on Tuesday.

The company has extended drilling further west, beyond the original discovery holes, to explore new target areas as the program was modified mid-course upon the geology team identifying promising HM content in panning samples, the filing added.

The maiden drilling program is now complete with samples on their way to Adelaide, per the filing.
