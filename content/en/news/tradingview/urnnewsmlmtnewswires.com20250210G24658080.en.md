Differ Group Auto was granted leave by the High Court of Hong Kong for the withdrawal of the application to convene a scheme meeting for the company's scheme creditors on Monday, a same-day bourse filing said.

The company had applied to the court on Wednesday, Feb. 5, to call the said scheme meeting to propose a revised scheme to the relevant creditors.

The withdrawal of the said application will also vacate the court hearing scheduled for Tuesday.
