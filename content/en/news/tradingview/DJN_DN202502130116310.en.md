UBS has lowered its supply forecasts for U.S. investment-grade credit and high-yield credit in 2025 on expectations that interest rates could stay high for a prolonged period. High interest rates are likely to discourage U.S. companies from issuing new debt, lowering corporate-bond supply. UBS forecasts U.S. investment-grade credit supply in 2025 at $1.5 trillion, $50 billion lower than their previously forecast. It expects U.S. high-yield credit supply to be $310 billion, $40 billion lower than their earlier projection. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
