Fed Chair Powell reaffirmed in the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that, with the Fed’s policy stance now significantly less restrictive and the economy remaining strong, there is no urgency to adjust the federal funds rate.

Powell also emphasized that the economy has made substantial progress toward the central bank’s goals over the past two years.

While labor market conditions have cooled from their previously overheated state, they remain solid.

Inflation has moved much closer to the 2% longer-run target, though it remains somewhat elevated.
