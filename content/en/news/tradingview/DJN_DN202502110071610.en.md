Boeing delivered 45 planes in January, the highest level since before last year's fuselage-panel blowout.

It's an encouraging milestone for Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg, who took over the company six months ago, and comes in the first full month of production following last autumn's machinists' strike.

The aerospace company delivered 45 planes last month, including 40 MAX jets, four 787 widebodies and a 777 freighter. It was the highest tally since December 2023.

However, Boeing's ability to stanch its cash burn hinges on whether it can substantially ramp up MAX production-not just deliveries.

Boeing produced about 20 MAXs in January, according to analysts. That's just over half of the 38-per-month rate Ortberg says Boeing must reach to turn cash-flow positive. Because the company has planes in inventory, it may ship out more jets than it builds in a given month.

Boeing booked 36 orders in January, mostly for MAX planes. Its backlog was 5,554 planes at the end of January. Of those, more than three-quarters are MAX planes.
