Amid shifting geopolitical dynamics and the Republicans’ tariff-driven policies, emerging market stocks are gaining traction. The MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index has risen 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting renewed investor interest.

Given this backdrop, investors may consider investing in fundamentally strong emerging market stocks such as Infosys Limited , Sea Limited , and Vale S.A. , which are poised to capitalize on their solid prospects.

Since the Republicans took office on January 20, U.S. trade policy has taken center stage, sending ripples across global markets. The new administration’s tariff proposals and immigration reforms are adding fresh uncertainties, particularly for economies heavily reliant on U.S. trade, such as Mexico and China. Meanwhile, China’s AI breakthrough with DeepSeek has rattled U.S. tech stocks, further intensifying economic tensions.

As a result, investors are reassessing their portfolios, seeking markets less exposed to U.S. policy risks. For instance, India, with its largely self-sustained economy and strategic positioning, is emerging as a favorable alternative. Conversely, Brazil is poised to capitalize on potential shifts in agricultural demand, as trade realignments could benefit its exports.

According to S&P Global, EMs are projected to drive global economic growth over the next decade, with an average GDP growth rate of 4.06% through 2035, compared to just 1.59% for advanced economies. Moreover, these markets are likely to contribute 65% of global growth, with economies like China, India, Vietnam, and the Philippines leading the charge.

Furthermore, investors’ interest in emerging market stocks is evident from the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF’s 6.3% returns over the past six months. For those looking to tap into this momentum, companies like INFY, SE, and VALE offer strong fundamentals and the potential for continued growth in the evolving global market. Let’s discuss them in detail:
