Prominent former U.S. Supreme Court lawyer Tom Goldstein was in federal custody on Monday for the second time in a month, after prosecutors said he made millions of dollars in cryptocurrency transfers using undisclosed accounts and posed a flight risk.

A spokesperson for the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office said Goldstein was in custody and in a bail review hearing Monday afternoon. Goldstein's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Goldstein, who argued more than 40 Supreme Court cases before retiring from legal practice in 2023, was indicted last month on 22 counts of tax evasion and other tax crimes allegedly connected to his side career as a high-stakes poker player.

The indictment said Goldstein, publisher of the SCOTUSblog news website, won and lost millions of dollars in individual poker matches and made improper payments through his law firm to cover debts. He pleaded not guilty on Jan. 27 and was granted pretrial release.

Prosecutors in their new arrest warrant alleged Goldstein received more than $8 million in cryptocurrency and sent more than $6 million in cryptocurrency over the last five days. He was obligated to disclose all of his financial accounts to the court, prosecutors said.

Goldstein's receipt and transfer of millions of dollars to other wallets "strongly suggests he is preparing to offshore his assets and flee," prosecutors said.

Prosecutors also alleged that Goldstein has tried to stop a potential witness who knew about his personal and law firm finances from cooperating with the investigation by "[offering] things of value, including cryptocurrency."

Goldstein was charged last month with borrowing millions of dollars to stake poker matches, underreporting his gambling winnings, and using funds from his law firm, then known as Goldstein & Russell, to pay off his debts.
