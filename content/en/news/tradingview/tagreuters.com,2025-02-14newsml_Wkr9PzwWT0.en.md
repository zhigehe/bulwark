Besqab AB

The CEO of Besqab AB (publ) ("Besqab") Magnus Andersson and Anders Österberg, Chairman of the Development Board in the City of Stockholm, started the housing project with a ceremony. The project includes 22 new townhouses in Vällingby in Stockholm.

The 22 new townhouses adds a new block in an already established area. Vemdalsgatan is a child-friendly area close to the metro, schools and shops. The homes will be completed in autumn 2026. The houses are built according to the Swan eco label.

**Magnus Andersson, CEO Besqab:**

"It's positive to be able to complement Vällingby's urban development with a new sustainable townhouse area that is close to both public transports and the natural areas at Riddersvik and Kanaan. The townhouses are popular and 11 of the houses are already booked, which is also a proof of that the market is much better now."

Anders Österberg, Chairman of the Development Board in the City of Stockholm:

"This new area frames Råcksta in a good way. These new townhouses provide opportunities for Vällingby residents to stay even if their families grows. In addition, more opportunities are created to attract new families to the district.
