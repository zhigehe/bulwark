Q4 US EARNINGS GROWTH NOW ESTIMATED HIGHEST IN 2024

With results now in from more than 300 of the S&P 500 companies, earnings for the fourth quarter are estimated up 14.8% from a year ago, putting that quarter on track for the highest earnings growth in 2024, according to LSEG data as of Friday.

That 14.8% growth also is up sharply from 9.6% estimated on Jan. 1.

Eighty-five percent of technology company reports so far have surpassed analysts' expectations and 87% of communication services earnings reports have exceeded analysts' expectations, compared with 76.3% overall for S&P 500 company earnings reports so far.
