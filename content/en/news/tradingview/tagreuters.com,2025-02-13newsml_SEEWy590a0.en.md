ZAGREB (Croatia), February 13 (SeeNews) - Croatian hotel owner and operator Jadran [ZSE:JDRN] said on Thursday it has short-listed potential strategic investors in the company's forthcoming capital increase process.

The short-listed investors had already placed non-binding offers and will be permitted to conduct due diligence at the company before submitting binding offers for participation in its capital increase, Jadran said in a filing to the Zagreb bourse, without elaborating.

Last month, Jadran proposed to its shareholders to increase the equity capital by up to 70 million euro ($72.9 million) through a new share issue to finance investments and working capital. The shareholders will vote on the proposal on March 10.

Crikvenica-based Jadran runs 15 hotels, resorts, pavilions and campsites located in the Adriatic towns of Crikvenica and Makarska and on the islands of Brac and Krk.

The companyâ€™s shares traded flat at 1.70 euro on the Zagreb bourse on Thursday morning.

($ = 0.960 euro)
