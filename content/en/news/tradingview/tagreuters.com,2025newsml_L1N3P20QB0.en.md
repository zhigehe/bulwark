Arabica coffee futures fell sharply on Tuesday after touching a new record high while cocoa and sugar prices rose.

COFFEE

\* Arabica coffee was down 3.6% at $4.06 per lb by 1505 GMT after hitting a record high of $4.2995 in early trading.

\* Dealers said the recent surge in prices had led to a reduction in liquidity with the market set to remain choppy.

\* An expected drop in Brazil's arabica coffee crop this year after hot and dry weather in 2024 has helped to tighten global supplies.

\* Broker Hedgepoint on Monday cut its forecast for Brazil's 2025/26 arabica crop to 41.1 million bags from a previous projection of 42.6 million.

\* Robusta coffee fell 0.3% to $5,680 a metric ton.

COCOA

\* New York cocoa futures rose 3.1% to $10,180 a ton.

\* Dealers said the market was supported by concerns about dry weather in top grower Ivory Coast.

\* A lack of rain in most of Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions could delay the start of the April to September mid-crop, potentially leading to a shortage of beans, the main ingredient in chocolate, farmers said on Monday.

\* London cocoa was up 2.3% at 8,098 pounds a ton.

SUGAR

\* Raw sugar futures gained 1.7% to 19.83 cents per lb.

\* Brazil's 2025/26 centre-south sugar production is expected to reach 43.3 million tons, Hedgepoint Global Markets said on Tuesday, forecasting an 8.5% increase compared with the previous season.

\* White sugar rose 1.7% to $528.30 a ton.

\* Dubai's Al Khaleej Sugar is operating at 70% capacity as sugar refineries in the Middle East struggle with overcapacity, managing director Jamal al-Ghurair said at the Dubai Sugar Conference on Tuesday.
