Missouri Representative Ben Keathley has introduced a new bill, proposing the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Fund.

The said fund would be placed under the control of the Missouri state treasurer, who’d be granted the power to purchase, invest, and hold $BTC using the state’s money. Missouri’s plan is to diversify the state’s investment portfolio. In addition to accepting gifts and donations, as well as taxes (including fees and fines), in crypto, Keathley also wants Missouri to follow a HODL strategy for $BTC.

Another US state to have taken a big step forward towards embracing crypto is Kentucky, which has introduced new legislation authorizing an investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets.

By doing so, Kentucky has officially become the 16th US state to have shown interest and/or have introduced legislation for Bitcoin reserves.

With Bitcoin (and crypto) adoption to skyrocket in the coming months – and a US Federal Bitcoin reserve looking very likely – thanks to the new pro-crypto Trump administration, here are five projects with the potential to become the next big cryptos.

**1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Overall Best Crypto to Invest in for Massive Returns**

**Solaxy ($SOLX)** is one of the best meme coins going around right now, primarily because it offers a brilliant mix of memeic appeal and real utility.

As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, $SOLX aims to improve the network by ensuring transactions are carried out more reliably, quickly, and cheaply – all aspects that Solana Layer 1 chains have been struggling with.

Another thing that’s unique about Solaxy is that it’s a multi-chain token. It connects two of the most active crypto ecosystems (Ethereum and Solana).

This will not only result in a large user base but also offer the best of both, i.e., Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s speed. All things considered, it’s hardly a surprise that **Solaxy** has become one of the biggest crypto presales, raising over $18.6M at the time of writing.

1 $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001628, and early adopters can also benefit from the project’s 217% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $SOLX.

**2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Crypto Offering Actionable Market Insights**

With AI gaining massive traction worldwide and in crypto, there’s little doubt that the best AI agent coin, **MIND of Pepe ($MIND)**, is one of the top new cryptocurrencies to watch out for.

Simply put, $MIND is an AI-powered autonomous entity (meaning it has a ‘mind’ of its own) that scans the market and offers early-stage crypto investment opportunities to token holders.

How does it do it? It interacts with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social platforms like X and gauges which way the crypto wind is blowing.  Additionally, $MIND is self-evolving, meaning once it’s armed with all the info and hype floating around online, it can drive conversations and trends, eventually becoming a Roaring Kitty on steroids and churning out one GME after another.

The **MIND of Pepe presale** has been a massive hit; it has crossed the $5M mark in virtually no time at all. You can get $MIND for just $0.0032792 each – here’s how to buy it.

**3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Revolutionary Crypto Project for First-Time Investors**

Unless you’re a seasoned crypto investor, or even if you are, following the memecoin market can be pretty daunting, let alone churning out consistent profits from it.

This is where **Meme Index ($MEMEX)** comes in. It’s a one-of-a-kind crypto project offering different baskets of meme coins, each with a varying degree of risk, profit potential, and volatility.

You can choose a meme coin basket depending on the kind of investor you are – risk averse or someone more aggressive.

For example, the Meme Titan Index is ideal for conservative investors who’d prefer average but steadier returns. On the flip side, the Meme Frenzy Index will appease risk takers, as it contains the next cryptos to explode. Considering the huge influx of new traders in the crypto space, $MEMEX’s less risky approach to memecoin investing is going to have a lot of takers.

You can benefit from its success by investing in its presale, which is currently ongoing and has already raised $3.4M. Each token is available at $0.0159713 – and here’s a guide on how to buy $MEMEX for more info.

**4. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Dominate Once Again**

Dogecoin is really the perfect example of the potential meme coins have. It was the first-ever unserious crypto, and with a current market cap of over $36B, it’s now the biggest meme coin in the world.

Plus, with Elon Musk planning to integrate this dog-themed crypto into X’s payment platform, there’s little debate that Dogecoin could not only follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory but also beat it.

After all, $BTC is up 116% in the last year, whereas $DOGE is up 210%.

It’s worth noting that although it has experienced a sizable price decline in recent weeks, $DOGE looks poised for a major comeback.

At the time of writing, Dogecoin is right in the face of a breakout, following which we could see a violent rally upwards. This means the current price of around $0.25 is a great entry point.

**5. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Follow the Crypto Man, the POTUS Himself**

One of the thumb rules of investing is to keep emotions out of it. So, irrespective of your personal opinions on Donald Trump, there’s no denying that his own meme coin $TRUMP is among the most lucrative trading opportunities right now.

![OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP)](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:962fbdd66094b-05616f221d089d6be5809f6956f27128-resized.jpeg)

Official Trump took the crypto market by storm when it shot up by over 12,000% overnight after its launch, making new crypto millionaires with every tick upwards.

Although recent price drops may suggest that $TRUMP is no longer the sensation it once was, the token boasts a massive market cap of $3.4B – meaning investors are aware of its potential.

With Donald Trump set to catapult crypto into insane new highs, $TRUMP, which is a reflection of his popularity and acceptance among crypto enthusiasts, could be among the biggest gainers in the market.

**Conclusion**

The potential of the above-mentioned next big crypto notwithstanding, beware that the crypto market is prone to violent ups and downs, which is why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.

Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must conduct your own research before jumping into crypto.
