Bristol-Myers Squibb said Monday its phase 2 trial evaluating Breyanzi in adults with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma met its primary endpoint in the marginal zone lymphoma cohort.

Marginal zone lymphoma is the second most common, slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when white blood cells cluster together to form lumps in a person's lymph nodes or organs, the company said.

The drugmaker said the data from the study showed that Breyanzi demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall response rate.

Additionally, it added that the trial met the key secondary endpoint of a complete response rate.
