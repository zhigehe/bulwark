Living alone comes with a hefty "singles tax," according to Zillow. Solo renters pay an extra $7,562 for a one-bedroom compared to sharing. This tax has increased by over $450 from last year due to rising rents. Couples or roommates save $15,123 annually, making cohabitation financially rewarding. New York City tops the list with a $20,100 annual premium for solo living. The top cities for this tax have remained stable, but Boston jumped from fifth to fourth place, overtaking Washington, D.C., reflecting its escalating rental costs, with average rent at $3,002 in December 2024, 53% above the national average. While solo living offers autonomy, the financial burden is significant, urging renters to weigh their lifestyle against the cost. (chris.wack@wsj.com)
