RHB Bank's earnings outlook could remain positive with 4Q 2024 profit expected between MYR750 million-MYR800 million, slightly lower than 3Q's record result of MYR833 million, Hong Leong IB analyst Chan Jit Hoong says in a note. Loan growth is on track to exceed 4.5%, supported by a strong retail banking segment, he notes. However, net interest margin may slip 5bps sequentially amid typical year-end competition, he reckons. While non-interest income is expected to soften on weak trading income, fee income may remain healthy as RHB continues to generate arbitrage forex returns from its liability management initiatives, he adds. Hong Leong maintains a buy rating on RHB Bank and keeps target price at MYR7.55. Shares are 0.3% higher at MYR6.56. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
