Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor on Sunday posted the Bitcoin tracker on X, signaling a possible resumption of Bitcoin acquisitions after a week's break. The hint comes as Bitcoin's price fluctuates, dipping below $96,000 earlier today before rebounding above $96,500, according to CoinGecko.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, currently holds 471,107 Bitcoin valued at over $45 billion at current market prices. The company's most recent acquisition of 10,107 BTC was made in the week ending Jan. 26, at an average price of $105,596 per coin.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm has invested approximately $30 billion in Bitcoin at an average price of $64,500 per coin, resulting in $15 billion in unrealized gains.

The potential purchase would mark Strategy's first Bitcoin acquisition since its corporate rebranding announced Thursday, when the company unveiled a new Bitcoin-themed visual identity.

Strategy also reported a $670.8 million net loss for the fourth quarter while adding 218,887 Bitcoin to its holdings. Revenue declined 3% year-on-year to over $120 million, falling short of forecasts by approximately $2 million.

The company's expenses increased nearly 700% to $1.1 billion, attributed to its '21/21 Plan' which aims to invest $42 billion in Bitcoin over three years. Strategy has utilized $20 billion of this plan, primarily through senior convertible notes and debt financing.

Bitcoin has fallen 11% from its January 20 record high of $108,786, following President Donald Trump's inauguration. The crypto asset traded at around $96,500 at press time, down approximately 3% in the past week.

Despite a number of positive regulatory and legislative developments post-inauguration, recent tariffs imposed by President Trump have rattled markets, causing a selloff in crypto assets. The risk of a trade war has increased uncertainty and reduced investor appetite for riskier assets.

Whether the crypto market heads north or south, Strategy is likely sticking to its Bitcoin purchase strategy.
