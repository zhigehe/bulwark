By Colin Kellaher

Shares of Phillips 66 rose sharply in early trading Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $2.5 billion in the oil refiner.

Phillips 66 shares, which closed Monday at $123.71, were recently up 6.6% at $131.89 in premarket trading.

Elliott plans to seek a number of changes to simplify Phillips 66, most notably pushing the company to sell or spin off its big midstream business, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
