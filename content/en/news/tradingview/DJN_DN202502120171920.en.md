Geely's new Galaxy L6 sedan could become a solid driver for the company's Galaxy brand to reach its 1.0 million unit sales target this year, Deutsche Bank analyst Bin Wang writes in a note. The company may launch five to six products under the Galaxy brand this year, he notes. Geely plans to host an "AI intelligent technology" event in March, to showcase its strategy on autonomous driving, and other tech features. DeepSeek's R1 model has significantly improved the AI assistant end-user experience. This could boost accuracy for automotive mobility cases and support Geely's vehicle sales, he adds. DB maintains a buy rating and HK$19.00 target price for the stock, which is last at HK$17.08.(jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
