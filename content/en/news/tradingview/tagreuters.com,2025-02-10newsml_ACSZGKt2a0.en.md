Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Net Sales of $7.2 million, Net Profit increased 566% from the prior year.

ATLANTA, GA / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / Luvu Brands, Inc. (OTCQB:LUVU), a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands, announced today its financial and operational results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 ending December 31, 2024.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, highlights include:

* Net revenue increased 6% to $7.2 million versus the prior year.
* **Gross margin increased to 28% from 27% a year ago.**
* Net income of $193,000 was in increase of 566% compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $402,000 was an increase of 47% versus the prior year.

For the six months ended December 31, 2024, highlights include:

* Net revenue was $12.94 million versus $12.91 million in the prior year.
* Gross margin increased to 27% compared to 26% from a year ago.
* Net loss was $17,000, down 82%, compared a net loss of $97,000 in the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $399,000 was in increase of 33% versus the prior year.

**Three Month Operating Results:**

* Net revenue in Q2 FY2025 increased 6% to $7.2 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to stronger sales from e-commerce sites and dropship network. This increase was slightly offset by a decline in our wholesale accounts.
* Gross profit in Q2 FY2025 totaled $1.98 million compared to $1.82 million in the prior year, while the gross margin improved to 28% in Q2 FY2025 versus 27% a year ago. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the increase in sales, lower freight, and reduced raw material costs compared to a year ago.
* Operating costs, excluding sales and marketing in Q2 FY2025, were $899,000, or 12.5% of net revenue, compared to $849,000, or 12.5% of net revenue in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expenses and professional fees.
* Sales and marketing expenses in Q2 FY2025 totaled $684,000, or 9.5% of net revenue, compared to $711,000, or 10.5% of net revenue, in the prior year. This decrease resulted from eliminating unprofitable pay-per-click spending and reduced graphic design needs due to fewer new product launches compared to the prior year.
* Net income in Q2 FY2025 was $193,000 compared to net income of $29,000 in the prior year. Increased sales and cost control measures returned a significant improvement compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $402,000 is a 47% increase from a profit of $273,000 a year ago.

**Six Month Operating Results:**

* Net revenue in six months ending December 31, 2024 increased 0.2% to $12.94 million compared to $12.91 million in the prior year. The company continues to focus on returning to growth through the development of new and innovated products at good margin.
* Gross profit during the six months totaled $3.5 million compared to $3.4 million in the prior year. Improved sourcing of raw material vendors and tighter control on production costs continues to improve the overall gross margin.
* Operating costs, excluding sales and marketing during the six months were $1,780,000, or 13.8% of net revenue, compared to $1,668,000, or 12.9% of net revenue in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expenses and equipment repairs.
* Sales and marketing expenses in the six months ending December 31, 2024 totaled $1,330,000, or 10.3% of net revenue, compared to $1,407,000, or 10.9% of net revenue, in the prior year. This decrease was the result from focusing on marketing channels that provide a higher return on spend. The company continues to seek out new marketing channels to reach more customers.
* Net loss for the six months was $17,000 compared to net loss of $96,000 in the prior year. Our strategy of continued improvement in our production and fulfilment processes coupled with innovative product launches significantly improved the bottom line compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $399,000 is a 33% increase from a profit of $299,000 a year ago.

Louis Friedman, CEO of Luvu Brands, commented, "Our second quarter results underscore the strength of our business model and the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives.

**\*Use of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA**

Luvu Brands management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the Company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance in accordance with GAAP, management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's operating results. The table below provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA income represents net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.
