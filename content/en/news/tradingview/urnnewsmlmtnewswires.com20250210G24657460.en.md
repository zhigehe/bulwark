EnergyPathways advanced its preliminary front-end engineering design, or pre-FEED, studies for the Marram Energy Storage Hub, an integrated energy system in northwest England.

The integrated energy system project, which is jointly developed by John Wood Group (WG.L), Mermaid Subsea Services and PDi, looks to combine gas production, storage, hydrogen storage, offshore wind, and low-emission power generation, the UK-based low-carbon integrated energy company said.

The final investment decision on the project that focuses on repurposing the Marram Gas Field is expected by the end of 2025, with production expected to start in 2027.
