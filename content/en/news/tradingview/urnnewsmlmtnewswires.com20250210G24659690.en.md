SK Inc.'s battery-making unit SK On finalized a three-way merger with SK Enterm and SK Trading International to strengthen its position as a global battery and trading company, according to a company release earlier this month.

The merger aims to improve raw material sourcing, expand trading operations, and improve financial stability.

SK On will use SK Trading International's expertise in raw materials trading and SK Enterm's storage assets to lower costs and mitigate market risks.

The combined entity expects an EBITDA boost of 500 billion won and expanded trading in battery metals such as lithium and nickel. SK On's assets are projected to increase to 40 trillion won after the three-way merger.

Shares of SK Inc. rose nearly 1% in recent trade on Tuesday.
