Hang Seng daily

Chinese stocks are on a roll, particularly tech stocks. That's helped the Hang Seng to the best levels since October, breaking the November and December highs today.

That's a nice looking chart that points to a re-test of the October highs.

That said, China stocks look to be inching towards a main-stream trade which is a red flag.
