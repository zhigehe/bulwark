* **Total Gross Revenues**: $358.5 million, reflecting an increase primarily due to an aggregate increase of $39.8 million in rental revenue.
* **Net Income**: $42.8 million, an increase of $14.2 million from the previous year, primarily due to increased rental revenue and gains on sales of properties.
* **Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders**: $37.9 million, reflecting the impact of preferred dividends and allocation to participating securities.
* **Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders - Per Common Share Basic**: $0.13, consistent with the diluted per share amount.
* **Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders - Per Common Share Diluted**: $0.13, reflecting the same value as the basic per share amount.

**Business Highlights**

* **Business Focus**: The company is a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on Class A warehouse and distribution real estate investments in the Sunbelt and lower Midwest regions. The portfolio is 100% industrial, following the disposal of remaining office properties.
* **Leasing Activity**: In 2024, the company entered into new leases and lease extensions covering 4.5 million square feet, with an average fixed rent increase from $4.22 to $5.89 per square foot.
* **Development Strategy**: The company focuses on build-to-suit projects and speculative development in target markets with strong growth prospects, such as expanding transportation networks and reshoring investments.
* **Tenant Base**: The company maintains a diversified tenant base, with the largest tenant representing 6.7% of annual base rent (ABR) and 46.9% of ABR from tenants with investment-grade credit ratings.
* **Institutional Fund Management**: The company co-invests with institutional investors in joint ventures, such as NNN Office JV L.P. and NNN MFG Cold JV L.P., to mitigate risks and earn management fees.
* **Geographical Performance**: The company targets markets in the Sunbelt and lower Midwest, focusing on areas with strong growth prospects, including population and employment growth.
* **New Production Launches**: In 2024, the company placed into service three fully-leased warehouse facilities in Phoenix, Arizona, Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Columbus, Ohio, totaling 1.4 million square feet.
* **Future Outlook**: The company plans to continue focusing on build-to-suit projects and limit speculative development to markets with sufficient tenant demand. It also aims to recycle capital from non-target markets to reduce indebtedness and invest in target markets.
* **Operational Efficiency**: The company maintains a net-lease structure for most properties, reducing exposure to operating cost increases, and focuses on re-leasing vacant properties at favorable rates.
* **ESG Initiatives**: The company achieved significant milestones in environmental, social, governance, and resilience (ESG+R) efforts, including installing smart meters and achieving green building certifications for over 33% of its portfolio.

**Strategic Initiatives**

* **Capital Recycling**: LXP Industrial Trust focused on capital recycling by disposing of non-target market properties and reinvesting in target markets, acquiring or completing $550.5 million in warehouse facilities. The company also emphasized build-to-suit projects over acquisitions due to higher yields and limited speculative development to markets with sufficient tenant demand.
* **Capital Management**: The company repaid $198.9 million of its 2024 Senior Notes and entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $250 million of term loans and $82.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities. LXP maintained an ATM program for potential equity issuance and did not repurchase shares under its share repurchase program. Dividends of $158.2 million were paid to shareholders, and the company maintained a $600 million revolving credit facility with no outstanding borrowings.
* **Future Outlook**: LXP plans to continue capital recycling to deleverage and support investment activities, focusing on build-to-suit projects and limiting speculative development. The company expects to access debt and equity markets opportunistically, despite potential volatility due to rising interest rates and inflation. LXP aims to maintain a strong liquidity position to fund development projects and meet debt obligations.

**Challenges and Risks**

* **Lease Defaults and Terminations**: The financial failure or default by a single tenant can significantly reduce operating cash flow and property value. Bankruptcy laws may limit the company's ability to recover damages.
* **Tenant Retention and Re-letting Risks**: Upon lease expiration, the company may struggle to re-let properties at favorable terms, impacting earnings and debt service capabilities.
* **Development Risks**: Real estate development activities are subject to risks such as cost overruns, delays, and the inability to lease completed projects, which could adversely affect cash flow and liquidity.
* **Market and Economic Risks**: Economic downturns, interest rate increases, and financial market disruptions could negatively impact property values and the company's ability to finance growth.
* **Environmental and Regulatory Risks**: Compliance with environmental laws and potential liabilities for hazardous substances could result in significant costs.
* **Cybersecurity Risks**: Cyber incidents could disrupt operations and damage relationships with tenants and investors.
* **Indebtedness**: The company's substantial debt could limit financial flexibility and increase vulnerability to economic conditions.
* **Management Strategies**: To address these risks, the company plans to recycle capital by selling non-target market properties and reinvesting in target markets, prioritize build-to-suit projects, emphasize long-term leases with escalating rents, and continuously monitor tenant credit to manage occupancy risks.
* **Market Risk Management**: The company is exposed to market risks, particularly interest rate fluctuations, which could increase borrowing costs and affect profitability. The use of interest rate swaps is a strategy to manage this risk, but it also introduces counterparty credit risk.
