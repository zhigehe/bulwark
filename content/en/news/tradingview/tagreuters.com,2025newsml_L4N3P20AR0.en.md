\*\* Eicher Motors' shares fall 6.1% to 5,013 rupees, set for biggest one-day drop in more than 1.5 years

\*\* Stock biggest loser on Nifty 50 and Nifty auto indexes, which are down 0.5% and 1.4% each

\*\* Royal Enfield motorcycle maker misses Q3 profit, margin estimates on higher costs and higher sales of low-margin models

\*\* Jefferies cuts FY25-27 EPS by 1%-5% on lower Royal Enfield margin at 24.9%, marketing initiatives to boost growth, and bunched up launch expenses; retains 'Buy'

\*\* "Believe Royal Enfield should be a key beneficiary of 2W premiumization, and the toughest phase of competition is behind" - Jefferies

\*\* Growth over margins is the right strategy, in our view - but with the stock pricing in high growth and high margins, achieving both will be tough - Morgan Stanley

\*\* Mean rating of stock is 'hold;' median PT is 5,437.50 rupees - LSEG

\*\* Peers Bajaj Auto , TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp 'buy'
