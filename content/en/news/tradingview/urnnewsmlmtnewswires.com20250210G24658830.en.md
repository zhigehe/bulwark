Exa Enterprise AI, a unit of ExaWizards , has started verifying AI agents that autonomously operate browsers to automate tasks such as scheduling, data entry, and report generation, according to a Monday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The technology, integrated into exaBase Generative AI, aims to enhance workplace productivity by reducing reliance on rigid RPA systems.

The company will pilot these AI agents with three partner firms and expand applications to general office workflows.
