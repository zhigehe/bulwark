BP (BP.L) said Tuesday that attributable profit and total revenues and other income for full-year 2024 declined year over year.

Profit attributable to shareholders for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was $381 million, compared with $15.24 billion earlier. EPS moved to $0.0232 from $0.8585.

The oil and gas giant's total revenues and other income was $194.63 billion, compared with $213.03 billion a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $155.3 billion in sales, and $0.45 in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board declared an interim dividend of $0.08 per share for the period, payable March 28 to shareholders on record Feb. 21. It paid $0.0727 per share a year ago. This takes the full-year dividend to $0.3054 per share, up from $0.2776 in the previous year.
