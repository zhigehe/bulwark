Shiseido reported a loss attributable to owners of the parent of 10.8 billion yen in the year ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, reversing the profit of 21.7 billion yen a year ago.

Loss per share was 27.06 yen compared with a profit of 54.43 yen a year ago.

The cosmetic company said the losses were attributed mainly to reduced core operating profit and structural reform expenses from the Early Retirement Incentive Plan in Japan.

Additionally, there was a 12.8 billion yen provision for finance costs from a seller note, according to its filing on Monday.

Net sales increased 1.8% to 990.6 billion yen from 973.0 billion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company said its results fell short of its forecasts due to a provision related to a seller note from the divestment of three makeup brands.

However, the provision, recognized as finance costs, did not affect cash flow, leading to a reduction in the year-end dividend to 10 yen per share, resulting in an annual dividend of 40 yen per share for 2024.

For 2025, it forecasted attributable profit to recover to 6.0 billion yen or 15.02 yen per share and net sales to grow 0.4% to 995.0 billion yen.

The company expects to pay interim and year-end dividends of 20 yen per share, each, for 2025.
