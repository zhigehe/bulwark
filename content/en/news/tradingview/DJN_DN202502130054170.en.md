AstraZeneca stands out among peers with its diversified pipeline of new experimental drugs and extensions for on-market assets, UBS analysts say in a note. "Clearly some studies will fail, but 2025 is a key catalyst year with data on seven high-value new drugs," they say. Its new small-cell lung and bladder indications for cancer drug Imfinzi and its late stage trials to broaden the label of pulmonary disease treatment Breztri are promising, they say. UBS analysts estimate that the British pharma company's late-stage pipeline has potential to add a further $17.6 billion sales in 2030. UBS upgrades its rating on the stock to buy from neutral. Shares are up 1.7% at 120.00 pounds. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)
