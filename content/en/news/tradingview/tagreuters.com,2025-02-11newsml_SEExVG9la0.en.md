LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), February 11 (SeeNews) - Slovenian consumer electronics retailer Big Bang said on Tuesday it targets annual sales of 250 million euro ($258 million) in five years in Croatia, its main market since the acquisition of local peer Sancta Domenica two years ago.

"By 2028, we want to increase sales on the Croatian market to a quarter of a billion euro, and generate more than 600 million euro in revenue at the level of the Big Bang Group," Big Bang CEO Uros Mesojedec said in a press release. Big Bang's revenue in Croatia has reached 165 million euro, he added.

In the beginning of the year, the company opened a new warehouse with more than 10,000 square metres of high-bay storage space opened in Sveti Nedelja near Zagreb.

It recently opened its tenth store on the Croatian market, in the Green Park shopping center in Varazdin, in the north of the country. Another store, in Zagreb's City Center One West shopping mall, will be be renovated and expanded this spring.

Big Bang also announced plans to rebrand the Sancta Domenica stores under the Big Bang brand.
