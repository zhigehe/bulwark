Nordnet

During Tuesday, Nordnet experienced a technical issue that caused its digital services to be unavailable between 11:20 and approximately 15:30 CET.

The first reports from customers regarding technical problems were received shortly after 11:00 CET. The issue resulted in some customers seeing incorrect account information. As a precautionary measure, Nordnet immediately decided to disable access to both the website and the app.

A rapid investigation was launched to identify and resolve the issue. The root cause was found to be a malfunctioning software component related to the login process. The disruption was not caused by any external interference. The faulty component was taken out of use, and by 15:30 CET, Nordnet's digital services were fully operational again. Throughout the incident, customers were able to place orders and manage their accounts via phone by contacting Nordnet's brokerage and customer service teams.

"Our top priority is the security of our customers and the availability of our platform. We take today's incident very seriously and fully understand the frustration this has caused. Our focus today has been on identifying and resolving the issue while keeping our customers informed. I sincerely apologize to our customers and want to assure them that we have taken steps to ensure this type of issue does not happen again," says Lars-Åke Norling, CEO of Nordnet.
