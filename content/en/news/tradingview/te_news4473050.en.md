Bulgaria’s trade deficit widened to BGN 1,674.5 million in December 2024 from BGN 1,485.9 million in the corresponding month of the previous year, preliminary estimates showed.

Exports fell 3.9% year-on-year to BGN 6,209.3 million, primarily attributed to lower sales to both EU (-3.6%) and non-EU (-4.4%) countries.

Meanwhile, imports grew 1.2% from a year earlier to BGN 7,883.8 million, mainly due to higher purchases from non-EU countries (12%).

However, purchases declined from EU countries (-5.5%).

Considering the whole period of 2024, the country’s trade shortfall went up to BGN 13,341.9 million from BGN 10,169.4 million in the same period last year.
