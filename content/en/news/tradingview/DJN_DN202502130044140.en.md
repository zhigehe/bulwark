Adyen shares jumped after the company reported a strong second half performance across all its key divisions.

On Thursday, the Dutch payments company posted a rise in revenue for the period to 1.08 billion euros, equivalent to $1.12 billion, up 22% on year. This was mainly driven by expanding business with existing customers and new business wins.

In early morning European trading, shares were up 218.60 euros, or 13.9%, at 1,798.40 euros. Over the past 12 months, shares have risen 24%.

EMEA and North America net revenue grew 27% and 21% on year, respectively. Revenue in Asia Pacific--a high-potential region for the company--climbed 12% on year. Meanwhile, Latin America showed positive momentum with a 12% growth on-year.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was 562.2 million euros, with the Ebitda margin at 53%, compared to 48% for the same period a year earlier.

Processed volumes were up 22% on year, to 666.4 billion euros, while digital volumes grew 21% on year.
