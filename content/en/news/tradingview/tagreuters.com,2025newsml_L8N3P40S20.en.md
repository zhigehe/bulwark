\*\* Kepler Cheuvreux cuts Cargotec's stock to "reduce" from "hold", citing a MacGregor sale shortfall for the Finnish engineering group and its target of flat earnings growth in 2025

\*\* In November, the firm said it sold MacGregor business to funds managed by Triton for 480 million euros ($499.92 million)

\*\* The sale shortfall stems from the buyer classifying Net Working Capital (NWC) as debt, a factor Cargotec hadn't reflected in its initial sale price, Kepler says

\*\* "Net, it leaves Cargotec with 376 million euros or 8.8 euros per share less cash versus our base-case valuation," the broker adds

\*\* Kepler also said it expects a potential rebound for the company's earnings only in 2026-2027

\*\* Shares of Cargotec are down 4.5% and among worst performers on pan-European STOXX 600 Index

($1 = 0.9602 euros)
