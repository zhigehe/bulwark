National Australia Bank will not close any branches in its rural and regional network until at least July 31,Â 2027, according to a Tuesday statement.

The bank has 437 branches across Australia with 210 in regional and rural areas. It invested AU$41 million across its branches over the last year.

"While digital banking continues to evolve, we firmly believe that face-to-face banking services remain essential for many Australians," said Group Executive for Personal Banking, Ana Marinkovic.

This comes after the bank introduced Saturday trading in November 2024, increasing the number of Saturday openings to 29 in February.

The bank has reached a new in-principle agreement with Australia Post to continue to support Bank@Post services, particularly in regional and rural Australia, the statement added.
