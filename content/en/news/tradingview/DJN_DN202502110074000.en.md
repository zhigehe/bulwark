EssilorLuxottica's earnings are accelerating on a steadily-growing optical market and a potential expansion of its smart glasses portfolio, Jefferies analysts say in a note. The Ray-Ban maker extended a partnership with Meta Platforms to develop smart-eyewear products with a new long-term agreement. Given Meta's ambitions in wearables, a broadened partnership or stakeholding seems possible, the analysts say. Jefferies analysts expect a third generation of smart glasses to be potentially ready for consumers in time for the 2025 holiday-shopping season. The broker upgrades its rating on the stock to buy from hold. Shares are up 1.8% at 277.20 euros. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)
