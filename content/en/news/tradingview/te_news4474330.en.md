The DAX was slightly higher to trade around 21,950 on Tuesday, setting new record highs, but investor caution lingered after President Donald Trump outlined the promised tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum.

At the same time, market participants are closely watching the ongoing earnings season and are particularly focused on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speeches to the Senate and House of Representatives, where more details on monetary policy could emerge.

Healthcare stocks were among the top gainers, with Fresenius and Beiersdorf rising 1.6% and 1%, respectively.
