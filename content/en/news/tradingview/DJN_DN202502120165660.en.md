The Aussie dollar-U.S. dollar pair is near 0.6280, after trading in a wide 70 point range in the U.S. trading session. The 0.6290 level is proving to be firm Fibonacci-related technical resistance for AUD/USD, says Krisitina Clifton, currency strategist at CBA. AUD/USD will likely follow the USD trend until the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate announcement on Tuesday, she adds. A 25 basis point cash rate cut, if delivered, will be the first since the Covid pandemic. Clifton says that if the RBA does not cut next week it would be a shock to the currency market and AUD/USD could lift by around 1 U.S. cent. (james.glynn@wsj.com ; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
