Giordano International expects a profit attributable to shareholders between HK$205 million and HK$225 million for 2024, lower than 2023, a Thursday bourse filing said.

The retail company attributed the expected decrease to a reduction in profit shares from its South Korean joint venture, a decrease in fair value gain, underperformance of its business in China, and certain one-off expenses resulting from the corporate requisition exercise during the reporting year.
