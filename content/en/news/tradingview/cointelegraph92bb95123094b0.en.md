Ether’s sentiment has likely hit rock bottom, which makes a near-term price reversal more likely, according to Ed Hindi, the co-founder of Swiss investment firm Tyr Capital.

“Ethereum has reached peak ‘bearishness’ and is now at a tipping point,” Hindi said in a Feb. 13 market report.

**Ether could retest $4,000 in coming months**

“Weak hands have been flushed out of the market,” Hindi said.

He added the current Ether market feels like Bitcoin did before spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the cryptocurrency launched in the US in January 2024.

Hindi said he expects that institutions holding Bitcoin will start to add ETH to their portfolios.

ETH is trading at $2,673 at the time of publication, down 0.64% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap.![Cryptocurrencies, Markets](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:92bb95123094b-50bd3242e1e181694ca76908630d2002-resized.jpeg)

Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said Ether’s weak sentiment is clear. She noted that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s comment to “make communism great again” has drawn more attention than the news that 21Shares is asking for staking to be added to its spot Ether ETF.

Ether jumped 3.5% to $2,776 an hour after 21Shares’ filing on Feb. 12, but it erased all those gains within 24 hours.

**ETF staking price pump “completely retraced”**

Crypto analyst Johnny told his 808,000 X followers that it is “honestly comical at this point that ETH has completely retraced its ETF staking pump.”

Meanwhile, Tyr Capital’s Hindi said he wouldn’t be surprised if Ether surged to $4,000 in the coming months and hit new all-time highs of $5,000 in 2025 — representing gains of 49% and 86% from its current price, respectively.

Several crypto commentators echoed Hindi’s sentiment, predicting ETH will see a price uptick soon.

Crypto trader Crypto Mister said in a Feb. 13 X post, “It’s only a matter of time before the ETH reversal.”

Crypto trader Poseidon said in a post on the same day that Ether’s price will be above $10,000 by March.
