Lattice Semiconductor said late Monday that Lorenzo Flores joined the company as its chief financial officer.

Flores has more than 30 years of technology industry and financial leadership experience, the company said. His track record includes working as the CFO at Intel Foundry, Xilinx, and UXComm.

Additionally, the company said Nicole Singer joined as the chief people officer, and Tonya Stevens, who served as interim CFO since October 2024, was named chief accounting officer.

Terese Kemble, chief people officer since 2019, is retiring but will remain with the company for the next few weeks to support transitions.

Late on Monday, Lattice also announced its Q4 results that showed non-GAAP earnings missed the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet, but revenue was a touch above consensus. The fiscal Q1 non-GAAP EPS and revenue outlook met the analysts' expectations.

Shares of the company were up 14% in premarket activity Tuesday.
