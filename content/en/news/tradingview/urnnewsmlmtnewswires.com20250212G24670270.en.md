Australian equities are poised to open higher on Thursday as investors remain optimistic after Insurance Australia posted higher profits in the fiscal first half.

The insurance firm reported Thursday that its cash earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.26, from AU$0.17 per diluted share a year earlier.

Meanwhile, Wall Street ended lower after January inflation data was hotter than expected.

The headline consumer price index in the US rose 0.5%, higher than the consensus estimates of 0.3% and 0.4% in December. The core CPI rose 0.4%, compared to a forecast of 0.3% and 0.2% a month earlier.

Nasdaq Composite was little changed at close, the S&P 500 closed down 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%.

In corporate news, Origin Energy reported Thursday that its earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.59 from AU$0.575 per diluted share a year earlier.

Domain Holdings Australia reported Thursday that its earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.0562, from AU$0.0398 per diluted share a year earlier.

Australia's benchmark index rose 0.6% to close at 8,535.30.
