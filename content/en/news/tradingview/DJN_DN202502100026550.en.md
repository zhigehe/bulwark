Germany's building-materials production could surprise further this year, Stifel analysts Tobias Woerner and Augustin Cendre say in a research note. The production of building materials in Germany was up 7.2% in December and is pointing to a nascent recovery, the analysts say. There is also now a clear volume divergence between Germany and the U.S., with Germany up high-single digits and the U.S down low-single digits in December, the analysts say. This divergence is expected to continue, they say. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)
