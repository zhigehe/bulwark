Gold futures rise to fresh highs as market concerns around President Trump's tariffs grow. Futures are up 1.5% at $2,931.20 a troy ounce, having risen as high as $2,934.10 an ounce earlier in the session. Safe-haven demand for gold is surging as anxiety mounts around the potential hit to global economic growth prospects from the new U.S. administration's protectionist drive, as well as its inflationary effect on U.S. domestic prices, says ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista. The risk-off sentiment was amplified by a new round of levies on steel and aluminum Trump announced over the weekend, as well as reiterated threats to match tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. exports, Evangelista says in a note. "Against this backdrop, gold risk remains tilted to the upside, with further price gains possible in the near term," he adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)
