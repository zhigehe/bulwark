Crocs isn't planning significant price increases in the short-term. While the clog and sandal company knows what it'll do for now, CEO Andrew Rees says "we don't necessarily know what's going to happen in the longer term." Rees on an earnings call says the company on a philosophical level considers factors including what the competition is doing as well as the strength of its own brands. He adds that past pricing efforts have helped its namesake brand's gross margin improve over the last few years. Rees also notes pricing is an important lever and the company feels well priced today but will remain nimble.(denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)
