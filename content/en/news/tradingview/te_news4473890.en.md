The BNP Paribas Real Estate Construction PMI in Ireland dropped to 48.2 in January 2025 from December’s 51.6.

It marked the fourth reduction in total construction activity in the past five months, as work was hampered by stormy weather during the month.

New orders fell for the first time in three months while purchasing activity shrank for the second consecutive month and to the steepest pace in two years.

Employment continued to rise, extending the current sequence of job creation to five months.

Meanwhile, delivery times lengthened further due to disruption from Strom Eowyn.
