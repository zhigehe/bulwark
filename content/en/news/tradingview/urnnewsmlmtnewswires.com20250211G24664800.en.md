Daiei Kankyo's profit attributable to owners of the parent rose 2.3% to 10.6 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024, from 10.3 billion yen a year ago.

The remediation services company said basic earnings per share rose to 106.89 yen from 103.40 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing on Monday.

Net sales grew 7.8% to 58.9 billion yen from 54.7 billion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company revised its earnings and dividend forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31 due to current performance.

The company raised its profit forecast due to ongoing cost reductions through insourcing, despite rising amortization of goodwill from newly consolidated subsidiaries by Dec. 31, 2024.

Further, it expect this positive trend to continue in the fourth quarter, bolstered by sales contributions from Kaisei, a new subsidiary from January 2025.

It forecasted attributable profit to grow 5.4% to 14.3 billion yen or 145.07 yen per share (from 13.7 billion yen or 138.53 yen per share) and net sales to gain 9.2% to 79.7 billion yen (from 78.5 billion yen previously).

It also raised its dividend forecast to include a year-end dividend of 25 yen per share (from 23 yen per share), bringing the total dividend for the fiscal year to 48 yen per share.

Shares of the company gained over 1% in recent trade.
