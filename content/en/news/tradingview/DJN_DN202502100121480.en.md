Gold is higher in the early Asian session, aided by prospects of demand for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation. U.S. President Trump on Monday announced global 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. Key commodities including gold have absorbed the latest round of inflation-inducing measures of the Trump administration, says Matt Simpson, market analyst at FOREX.com and City Index. Gold's daily chart shows a strong bullish trend which appears averse to any meaningful pullback greater than a day, Simpson adds. Spot gold is 0.3% higher at $2,916.41/oz. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
