Coca-Cola reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Tuesday amid volume and pricing gains, while the beverage giant projected annual growth in its earnings and organic revenue for 2025.

Adjusted earnings came in at $0.55 a share for the December quarter, up from $0.49 the year before and ahead of the FactSet-polled consensus of $0.52. Adjusted revenue climbed to $11.4 billion from $10.95 billion in the prior-year quarter, topping the Street's view for $10.68 billion. The stock inclined 4.1% in premarket activity.

"Our all-weather strategy is working, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to lead through dynamic external environments," Chief Executive James Quincey said in a statement. "Our global scale, coupled with local-market expertise and the unwavering dedication of our people and our system, uniquely position us to capture the vast opportunities ahead."

For the full year 2025, the maker of Fanta and Sprite anticipates adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 3%, including a foreign-exchange headwind of 6% to 7%. Organic revenue is pegged to advance by 5% to 6%. In the previous year, adjusted EPS rose 7% to $2.88 while organic sales jumped by 12%.

The Street's current estimate is for non-GAAP EPS of $2.95 and sales of $47.45 billion for the current year.

Coca-Cola recorded a 9% rise in consolidated price and mix for the fourth quarter, with roughly four points driven by pricing in markets experiencing "intense inflation," according to the company. Concentrate sales, which reflect the quantity of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders and minerals sold by the company, increased 5% on a yearly basis, boosted in part by the timing of concrete shipments. Foreign currency had a negative impact of 3% on revenue.

Consolidated unit case volume moved 2% higher in the quarter, led by China, Brazil and the US. Volume grew across all geographic segments, led by Asia Pacific with a 6% rise, except for the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, where it was flat.

Volume gained 2% each in the sparkling soft drinks and water, sports, coffee and tea divisions. In the juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages operation, volume ticked down 1% as growth in North America was offset by declines in Europe, Middle East and Africa, the company said.

For the ongoing quarter, Coca-Cola expects currency headwinds of 5% to 6% on adjusted EPS and 3% to 4% on adjusted revenue.
