Spot basis bids for corn and soybeans were mostly steady at elevators, river terminals and processors around the U.S. Midwest on Tuesday, a spot check showed, as futures ticked down.

\* In one exception, corn and soy basis bids rose at a river terminal in Davenport, Iowa.

\* In its monthly supply and demand report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported U.S. ending stocks of corn and soybeans were unchanged from January, contrary to trade expectations that the agency would cut ending stocks of both.

\* CBOT March corn (CH25) settled down 7-1/2 cents to $4.84 a bushel.

\* CBOT March soybeans (SH25) ended down 6 cents at $10.43-1/2 a bushel.
