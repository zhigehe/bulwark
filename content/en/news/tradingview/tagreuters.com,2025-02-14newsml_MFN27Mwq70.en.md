Nimbus Group's recently launched Aquador 400 HT has been named the Cabin Cruiser of the Show at the ongoing international boat show in Helsinki, Vene 25. The Aquador 400 HT premiered as recently as January this year and has received significant attention and appreciation since its launch. The boat is the last in a series of three new Aquador models that began being launched by Nimbus Group in the summer of 2023, marking the largest product renewal for the Aquador brand in 20 years.

"This award is yet another testament to Nimbus Group's ability to design and develop attractive boats within the premium segment. The Aquador brand has a large and dedicated customer base that has been looking forward to the rejuvenation of the models now being carried out, and what this award signifies is that they will not be disappointed," says Michael Bohm, Chief Marketing Officer of Nimbus Group.

Aquador turned 30 this year and the 400 HT, with an overall length of just over 12 meters and a width of nearly 4 meters, is the brand's largest model to date. The brand holds a strong position in the Nordic region, but Nimbus Group has begun introducing Aquador boats to selected markets in the rest of Europe and in North America.

"Aquador's new boat models fit very well into our product and brand portfolio within the premium segment, and we see good opportunities for a successful expansion in several markets outside the Nordic region," says Nimbus Group CEO Jan-Erik Lindstr√∂m.
