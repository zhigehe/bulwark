YIT Corporation Press Release February 10, 2025, at 2:00 p.m.

The Business and Competitiveness Subcommittee decided in its meeting on 10 February to grant YIT a planning reservation for the area north of the center of Leppävaara. YIT commits to designing the area on the basis of the Walk Around proposal, which won the idea competition and was developed by YIT, ARCO Architecture Company, and the design and consulting company Ramboll.

In the winning proposal, the area is designed to be recognizable and of high architectural quality. The goal is a vibrant center, where services, housing, jobs, events, and recreational opportunities create an urban city structure. The north and south sides of Leppävaara city center will be connected by a deck structure that crosses the train track and Turuntie, forming a central city block, which contains housing.

The purpose of the urban space is to serve as a living room that promotes a sense of community. The plan has pedestrian and cycling routes, stormwater management, and the strengthening of biodiversity at its heart.

"We are very excited about the opportunity to start developing Leppävaara's new urban center. YIT's urban development expertise, combined with the diverse expertise of our partners Arco and Ramboll, creates an excellent starting point for the planning of an attractive and sustainable urban environment,” says **Juha Kostiainen**, YIT’s Director of Urban Development, adding: “we invest in open and close cooperation with the City of Espoo in order to achieve the best possible outcome.”

Next, YIT is preparing to apply for a zoning change based on the winning design. As the zoning process progresses to the detailed plan proposal stage, the city may, if necessary, divide the reserved area into smaller parts and allocate reservations to other operators for those areas.

YIT develops and implements sustainable living environments and projects that promote the green transition. YIT is the first Finnish construction company to commit to science-based emission reduction targets (SBTi).
