LightPath Technologies, Inc., a leading provider of next-generation optics and imaging systems for both defense and commercial applications, has released its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on December 31,Â 2024. The company reported a slight increase in revenue but faced challenges in profitability and operating expenses.

**Financial Highlights**

For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, LightPath Technologies reported a revenue of $7.4 million, a 1.5% increase compared to $7.3 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. However, the company experienced a decrease in gross profit, which fell by 11% to $1.9 million, representing 26% of total revenues, down from 30% in the prior year. The net loss for the quarter was $2.6 million, a significant increase from the $1.7 million loss reported in the same period last year. EBITDA loss also widened to $1.5 million from $0.5 million in the previous year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

During the quarter, LightPath Technologies announced the acquisition of G5 Infrared, a high-end infrared camera systems manufacturer. This acquisition is part of LightPath's strategic vision to become a leading vertically integrated infrared imaging solutions provider. Additionally, the company began sustained delivery of infrared assemblies to a European defense customer for use in FPV drone applications and launched new optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras for industrial and oil & gas applications.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

LightPath Technologies highlighted several strategic initiatives, including the acquisition of G5 Infrared, which is expected to drive future growth with its higher average selling prices and high-margin cooled infrared camera offerings. The company also received Phase 2 funding from the U.S. Defense Department to qualify additional BlackDiamond glasses as substitutes for germanium, a critical material facing export restrictions from China.

**Management's Perspective**

Sam Rubin, President and CEO of LightPath, emphasized the significance of the G5 Infrared acquisition, noting its potential to enhance the company's product offerings and operational synergies. Rubin also highlighted the growing interest in LightPath's BlackDiamond materials as a substitute for germanium optics, particularly in light of recent geopolitical supply chain issues.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead, LightPath Technologies plans to integrate G5 Infrared into its operations and capitalize on new business opportunities in the government and defense sectors. The company is also progressing with key defense programs, including a bid to produce a design for a major missile program for the U.S. Army in collaboration with Lockheed Martin. Management expressed optimism about the company's growth prospects and its vision of becoming a vertically integrated optics and imaging solutions provider.
