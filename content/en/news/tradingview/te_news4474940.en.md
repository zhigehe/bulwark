The FTSE MIB gained ground to trade nearly 1% higher on Tuesday afternoon, hitting fresh December 2007 highs and outperforming its regional peers.

Traders focused on Fed Chair Powell's comments ahead of tomorrow's US inflation data release, while also keeping an eye on ongoing corporate earnings reports.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed Congress, noting that while the US economy remains strong and inflation is moving toward the 2% target, it is still high, and there is no urgency for rate cuts.

Meanwhile, they remained attentive to President Donald Trumpâ€™s next moves after he signed off on 25% tariffs for steel and aluminium imports, having warned of more measures to come.

Among single stocks, Prysmian led the gains, up 3.7%, followed by Ferrari (+3.2%) and Mediobanca (+2.7%) after releasing financial results that exceeded expectations.
