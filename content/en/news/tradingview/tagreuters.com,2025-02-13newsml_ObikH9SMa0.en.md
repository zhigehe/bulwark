Hydro Energi AS has announced its intention to enter into a contract with AFGruppen for the construction of the Valldalen dam and flood diversion project.The agreement has an estimated value of NOK 200 million excluding VAT.

Dam Valldalen is located in Ullensvang municipality and dams up the Valldalreservoir, the largest reservoir for the Røldal power plant. Hydro is nowupgrading Dam Valldalen to address climate change and increased flooding. AFGruppen will carry out the construction work.

At Dam Valldalen, the existing concrete spillway will be demolished. A newconcrete dam with a bottom outlet gate (new spillway with outlet gate) will bebuilt to replace the demolished concrete spillway. The side channel forfloodwater will be expanded by blasting, and a new flood tunnel will beestablished/blasted in addition to the existing flood shaft/tunnel. Toaccommodate the expansion of the side channel, the road passing the spillwaywill need to be relocated further into the terrain.

Work is scheduled to start in April 2025 and be completed in June 2026.

"AF Gruppen is pleased to have been chosen by Hydro to build the new flooddiversion. The project fits well with our capacity and expertise in tunnels,concrete, and hydropower. AF looks forward to strong cooperation with Hydro,"says Geir Flåta, EVP Civil Engineering at AF Gruppen.
