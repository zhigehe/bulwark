The Australian dollar strengthened past $0.63 on Wednesday, approaching its highest level in eight weeks as traders largely shrugged off the latest tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

Markets also adjusted their expectations regarding the impact of escalating tariffs on inflation, while awaiting the release of the latest US CPI report.

Domestically, investors continued to monitor the outlook for the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s monetary policy.

There is growing speculation that the RBA may begin cutting interest rates this month, as inflation eases and signs of slowing economic growth emerge.

However, recent data showed that Australian consumer confidence remained in pessimistic territory, weighed down by concerns over stretched household finances and persistent cost-of-living pressures.
