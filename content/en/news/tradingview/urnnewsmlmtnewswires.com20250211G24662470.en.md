Bio-Thera Solutions signed an agreement with Intas Pharmaceuticals subsidiary Accord Biopharma for the licensing and commercialization of the BAT2506 injection in the US, according to a Tuesday filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Under the agreement, Bio-Thera will be eligible to receive from Accord a $21 million down payment and milestone payments of not more than $143.5 million.

Bio-Thera will also receive a double-digit percentage of net sales from Accord, the filing said.

BAT2506 or gomulimab is an antibody that targets autoimmune disorders such as moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, or active ankylosing spondylitis, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.
