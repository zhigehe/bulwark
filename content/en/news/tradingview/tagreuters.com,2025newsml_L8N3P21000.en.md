MFE-MediaForEurope , the TV group controlled by Italy's Berlusconi family, is expected to drop out of the race for Polish broadcaster TVN, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.

One of the people said the Milan-listed company would likely focus on other potential M&A targets as Polish bidders are seen in pole position for a TVN deal.

A spokesperson for MFE declined to comment.

Polish representatives for Warner Bros Discovery , which owns TVN, did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.

Reuters reported last month that MFE had filed a preliminary bid for TVN's free-to-air business.

TVN has attracted non-binding bids also from Polish businessman Michal Solowow and media group WP Holding.
