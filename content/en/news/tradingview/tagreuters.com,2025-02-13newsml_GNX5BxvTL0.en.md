Southfield, Michigan, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **Credit Acceptance Corporation** (referred to as the “Company”, “Credit Acceptance”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) announced today that it plans to offer $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2030 (the “notes”). We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all of our $400.0 million outstanding 6.625% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”), in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 notes, and the payment of fees and expenses in connection therewith. Pending this application of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, the net proceeds may be invested in short-term investments or applied to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility without reducing the lenders’ commitments thereunder.

The notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The notes will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the 2026 notes or an obligation to issue any such notice of redemption.

Statements in this release that are not historical facts, such as those using terms like “may,” “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” or similar expressions, and those regarding our future results, plans, and objectives, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements, which include statements concerning the offering of the notes and use of the net proceeds therefrom, represent our outlook only as of the date of this release.
