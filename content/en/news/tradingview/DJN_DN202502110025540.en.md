The euro could fall to parity against the dollar by mid-year as President Trump's tariff plans will hurt the eurozone economy, Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley says in a note. The EU said Tuesday it would retaliate against new U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminium exports. Meanwhile, the WSJ reports that senior Trump administration officials are heading across the Atlantic to tackle points of tension. Europe is vulnerable to tariffs as it has a far more open economy than the U.S., Foley says. "While retaliatory tariffs could raise prices in the EU, the eurozone economy is currently weaker than that of the U.S." The euro is last up 0.1% at $1.0318. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
