The Swedish central bank's interest rate now appears consistent with inflation at target level in the short and long term, making monetary policy well positioned to manage future challenges, Riksbank Deputy Governor Anna Seim said on Tuesday.

"This is true regardless of whether domestic consumption and GDP growth turn out to be weaker than expected, or whether the tense global situation leads to supply shocks that create inflationary impulses in the Swedish economy," she said.

In a statement released ahead of a speech later on Tuesday, Seim said that the Riksbank was prepared to adjust monetary policy if the outlook for inflation and economic activity changed.
