Operating in the market for three decades, iFOREX announced today (Tuesday) that after a seven-year absence, Hemi Algranaty has returned to the company to serve as Head of Innovation. At the same time, the FX/CFD broker renewed its sponsorship agreement with PSV Eindhoven, the Dutch club competing in the Champions League.

**iFOREX Names New-Old Executive**

The company named Algranaty as Head of Innovation, returning to the firm where he previously served as Chief Technology Officer from 2006 to 2018. Algranaty, who most recently worked as CTO at Wiser Market, will oversee artificial intelligence implementation and product development initiatives.

Pavlos Antoniou also joins as EU Marketing Director after serving as Global Creative Operations Director at Dilagon. The appointment comes as the company increases resources dedicated to expanding its European operations.

“Welcoming Hemi and Pavlos to our team marks an exciting phase of our growth,” said iFOREX Chief Executive Officer Itai Sadeh. “Their extensive expertise and experience will be invaluable as we build upon our offering and access new markets, and I look forward to collaborating with them both.”

**PSV Eindhoven**

The company also renewed its marketing partnership with PSV Eindhoven, a Dutch football club that plays in the Champions League. The financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed.

"As we continue to thrive in a rapidly growing market, continuous investment is crucial to our goal of becoming a leader in the electronic trading industry," Sadeh added. “This focus ensures we remain at the forefront of innovation and excellence, delivering unparalleled value to our clients.”

iFOREX, founded in 1996, operates under Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission regulation and offers trading in over 870 contract-for-difference instruments through its proprietary platform.
