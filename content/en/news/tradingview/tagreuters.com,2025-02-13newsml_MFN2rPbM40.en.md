**CEO Fredrik Persson comments:**“The second half of 2024, just like the first half of the year, was characterized by continued progress in the U.S. market. We are now getting increasingly closer to the point where the company’s main challenges go from being regulatory and study related to being about how to scale up the U.S. sales to be able to reach breakeven and then generate profit in the most efficient way possible.”
