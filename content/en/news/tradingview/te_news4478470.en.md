The Baltic Exchange's dry bulk sea freight index, which tracks rates for ships carrying dry bulk commodities, snapped its three-day losing streak on Thursday, rising four points to 780 points, buoyed by the smaller vessels.

The supramax index advanced for the eighth straight session, rising 17 points to 741 points.

Meanwhile, the capesize index, reflecting rates for large vessels transporting cargoes like iron ore and coal, was unchanged at 711 points, holding near its lowest in nearly two years; and the panamax index, typically associated with ships carrying 60,000-70,000 tons of coal or grain, eased nine points to 974 points.
