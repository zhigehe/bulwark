China's lottery ticket sales rose 7.6% over the year to 623.49 billion yuan in 2024, Xinhua reported Friday, citing data from the Ministry of Finance.

Sales of lottery tickets supporting the country's welfare system reached about 208 billion yuan in 2024, a 7% increase from the prior year.

Sports industry-related lottery ticket sales rose 7.9% to 415.53 billion yuan, the ministry said.

In December last year, the country's lottery ticket sales were 57.57 billion yuan, an 8% yearly increase.
