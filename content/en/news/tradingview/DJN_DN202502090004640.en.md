By Suzanne Vranica

Super Bowl commercials have always been the most expensive real estate on TV, and this year is no different. A 30-second spot during the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdown has set a new record, with some brands paying as much as $8 million.

That's a far cry from the $42,000 brands paid for Super Bowl I in 1967-just shy of $400,000 in today's dollars. But advertisers are willing to pay top dollar for access to so many eyeballs-a record 123.4 million viewers tuned in last year, thanks in part to Taylor Swift's presence.

Not all advertisers pay the maximum amount. Those buying multiple ads or getting spots in the game as part of bigger packages with Fox often get a lower price. A last-minute spot can exceed the average price.

The Super Bowl is such a big draw in part because it continues to be the one event where people actually want to watch commercials. So while $8 million sounds outrageous, for many brands, it's a price worth paying for marketing immortality.
