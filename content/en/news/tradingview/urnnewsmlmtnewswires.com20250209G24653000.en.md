Smartgroup said that its unit, Smartsalary, was appointed the exclusive administrator of salary packaging and novated leasing services for Monash Health under an initial three-year agreement effective April. 1, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The contract, which can be extended for an additional two years, will cover services for approximately 25,000 employees at Victoria's largest public healthcare provider, the filing said.

The company does not expect the contract to significantly impact earnings in the first half of the fiscal year, the filing added.
