Sterling could rise against the euro if President Trump follows through on his threat for EU tariffs, ING's Chris Turner says in a note. The market expects the EU has more to lose than the U.K. on tariffs, he says. "We cannot rule out another drop in EUR/GBP to the 0.8250 area should tariffs hit Europe in the early part of this week." Against the dollar, however, sterling could fall towards the lower end of a 1.2250-1.2500 trading range. A speech from Bank of England official Catherine Mann on Tuesday and U.K. economic growth data Thursday could signal more interest-rate cuts. EUR/GBP trades flat at 0.8322 but GBP/USD rises 0.2% to 1.2397. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
