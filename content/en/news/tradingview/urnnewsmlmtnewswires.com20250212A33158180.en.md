The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday maintained its global oil demand projections for 2025 and 2026, while flagging uncertainty from the impact of potential tariffs.

The cartel continues to expect world oil demand to grow by 1.45 million barrels a day this year and by 1.43 million barrels in 2026, it said in its monthly report.

"Growth this year is expected to be driven by transportation fuels on the back of strong air travel demand and healthy road mobility," the OPEC said. "Capacity additions and petrochemical margins are expected to continue to contribute to oil demand growth."

The OPEC continues to project the world economic growth rate 3.1% for 2025 and 3.2% for next year, with the US projections left unchanged at 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.

"It remains to be seen how and to what extent potential tariffs and other policy measures will play out" for the global economy, the cartel said. "So far, they are not anticipated to materially impact the current underlying growth assumptions."

On Monday, US President Donald Trump signed proclamations raising tariffs on metal imports to 25%. The European Union on Tuesday vowed to retaliate. Mexico and Canada also condemned Trump's move, Reuters reported.

Last week, Trump delayed plans for 25% general import tariffs on Canada, which ING recently said was the biggest supplier of aluminum to the US in 2023. China has set out a series of retaliatory tariffs against the US, while the Trump administration paused the announced general tariffs on Mexico.

For the US, the OEPC expects the overall effect of tariffs to remain "minimal, provided there is no major escalation in trade tensions." The cartel expects inflation in the world's largest economy to gradually drop this year, though its trajectory "could be influenced" by the Trump administration's economic policies and labor market dynamics, according to the report.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil was down 2.2% at $71.69 a barrel in Wednesday afternoon trade, while Brent fell 2% to $75.43. Both were on track to snap three-day winning streaks.

Liquid supply from countries not participating in the Declaration of Cooperation, or DoC, is now expected to grow by 1.01 million barrels a day this year, down from the prior outlook of 1.11 million barrels. The cartel lowered its 2026 supply growth outlook to 1 million barrels a day from 1.10 million barrels. The DoC is the name for OPEC+, which comprises OPEC and non-OPEC members.
