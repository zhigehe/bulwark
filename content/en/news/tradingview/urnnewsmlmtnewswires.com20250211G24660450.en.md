Fitch Ratings placed Holcim's long-term issuer default rating of BBB on rating watch positive on Monday.

The rating agency expects the building materials company's credit profile to support an upgrade to BBB+ even after the planned spinoff of its North American business. It noted that Holcim's consolidated profile is strong for its current rating thanks to its strong operating performance, profitability, and diversification.

Fitch said it will resolve the Rating Watch Positive after the full details of the planned business split are disclosed and its rating case is updated. It noted that the process may take longer than six months.
