Public Bank's 4Q 2024 profit may decline by mid-to-high single digits sequentially, amid net interest margin pressure and lower pre-emptive provisions reversals, RHB IB analysts David Chong and Nabil Thoo say in a note. Operating income could hold steady, supported by stable loan growth despite deposit competition, they reckon. However, 4Q results may be volatile due to a MYR350 million-MYR520 million goodwill impairment, credit losses in Hong Kong's unit, and LPI Capital's maiden contribution after its stake acquisition, none of which are factored into RHB's forecasts, they say. Still, the market may focus on Public bank's outlook and updates on major shareholder's stake holdings instead of the earnings result, they add. RHB stays neutral on Public Bank and keeps the target price at MYR4.80. Shares are 0.2% lower at MYR4.49.(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
