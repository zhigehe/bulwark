ArcelorMittal has proposed moving some of its business-support activities outside of Europe to save costs, according to media reports Tuesday.

The company reportedly floated the idea of moving activities to India during a meeting with its European works council, a body representing employees, according to the reports.

The proposal comes at the heels of challenges that ArcelorMittal previously said threatened the competitiveness and sustainability of European steelmaking.

ArcelorMittal did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.
