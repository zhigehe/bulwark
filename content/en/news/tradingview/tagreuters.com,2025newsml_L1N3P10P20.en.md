GBP/USD tested the lower end of its recent range on Monday, supported, for now, by the 21-DMA at 1.2369, but the risks are skewed to the downside if upcoming data come out in line with forecasts.

With UK-U.S. rate spreads diverging in the dollar's favor, a steady U.S. headline inflation reading on Wednesday, as analysts expect, and UK GDP and output data on Thursday that matches economists' projections for weakness would leave the risks for GBP/USD skewed to the downside. UK inflation is due next week.

Adding to the dollar's strength are expectations of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum that could disrupt global trade, though the U.S. and UK inflation figures will probably hold more sway.

Last week's dovish BoE rate cut, alongside the Fed's steady policy, has led STIR futures to price UK rates below U.S. rates by December, dismantling long-held sterling support from monetary policy.

If upcoming CPI reports support the current rate outlooks, sterling's Feb. 3 tariff-related flash low at 1.2249 and 2025 fiscal-related low on Jan. 13 will likely come into sharper focus.
