Baidu will make its artificial intelligence chatbot Ernie Bot available for free on both desktop and mobile platforms starting April 1, multiple media outlets reported Thursday.

Baidu will also roll out a free advanced search function that would provide enhanced reasoning capability and tool integration, according to the reports.

Baidu had said its Ernie 4.0 chatbot is comparable to OpenAI's GPT-4.

Baidu did not immediately respond to requests for comment from MT Newswires.

The company's shares were up over 2% in recent premarket activity.
