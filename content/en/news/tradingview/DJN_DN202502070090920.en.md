Investors are mostly betting the Fed will cut interest rates at least once this year, but BNP Paribas' James Egelhof and Andrew Husby see no easing in 2025. The FOMC will likely "remain on hold through mid-2026," they write in comments about today's jobs report. They highlight that "the trend rate of hiring rose, the unemployment rate dropped despite higher participation, and wage growth picked up." Egelhof and Husby see the potential for even more tightening: "if strong labor demand continues, we think this would significantly increase the risk of the FOMC needing to hike rates this year."
