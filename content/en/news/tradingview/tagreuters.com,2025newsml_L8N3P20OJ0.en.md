\*\* Shares in Italy's UniCredit fall 3.5%, despite better-than-expected Q4 results, a Milan-based trader pointing out a "sell-on news dynamic"

\*\* The trader adds the media report on Del Vecchio family's holding Delfin exploring a sale of its stake in the lender can also impact the shares

\*\* Analysts at J.P.Morgan say that the bank recorded a "solid Q4 driven by NII, with FY25 guidance too conservative"

\*\* Tuesday's fall reduces the bank's YTD gains to about 18.1%
