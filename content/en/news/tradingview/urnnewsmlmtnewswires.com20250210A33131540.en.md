Patriot Battery Metals said overnight Sunday that it commenced a winter drill program at its Shaakichiuwaanaan property in Quebec.

The company said the campaign began in late January and will continue through mid-April for an estimated total of 15,000 meters.

The drill program will focus on extending the high-grade Vega zone, testing the highly prospective CV5 to CV13 pegmatite corridor, and completing condemnation drilling at two proposed waste rock pile locations in support of the ongoing feasibility study at the CV5 pegmatite.

"2025 will be a less drill intensive year compared to 2024; however, exploration drilling along the CV Trend remains a key component of the company's flowthrough spend strategy as the CV5 pegmatite advances through development," said Darren Smith, Patrioti's executive vice president of exploration.

Patriot said it is on track to release a feasibility study and maiden ore reserve estimate in the third quarter.
