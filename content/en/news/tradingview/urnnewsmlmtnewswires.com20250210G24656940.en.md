Haydale Graphene Industries filed the necessary court documents to begin the corporate insolvency process for its wholly owned Haydale Ceramic Technologies in the US.

The British graphene nanomaterials group said Monday it intends to sell the unit's assets through a public auction. The court hearing for the insolvency process is expected to take place soon and the unit is expected to remain in Chapter 11 under the US Bankruptcy Code for up to 90 days.

The decision to sell the loss-making business was made after the Haydale board said it expects losses to continue in fiscal 2025 and the divestment would be in the best interest of shareholders.
