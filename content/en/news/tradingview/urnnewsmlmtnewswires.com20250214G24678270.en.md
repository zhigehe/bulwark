Australian shares closed the week flat with a positive bias, having earlier hit an all-time high as investors cheered signs that US President Trump's tariffs may be delayed for weeks.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed to close at 8555.8.

Trump signed a measure directing the US Trade Representative and Commerce Secretary to propose new tariffs on a country-by-country basis, with studies expected by April 1 and potential action shortly after, Bloomberg reported.

A Bloomberg survey found 92% of respondents expect US tariffs within six months, with over half predicting tariffs on some economies and a third expecting broad levies, the report said.

In company news, HealthCo Healthcare and Wellness REIT said it has been approached by a consortium led by HMC Capital's private equity division to potentially lease 11 hospitals owned by the company and an unlisted healthcare fund.

Cochlear reported Friday that its six-month earnings per diluted share rose to AU$3.125 from AU$2.913 per diluted share a year earlier. Shares fell 14% at market close and earlier hit an all-time low.

Lastly, AMP reported Friday that its earnings per diluted share in 2024 fell to AU$0.056 from AU$0.091 per diluted share a year earlier. Shares fell 15% at market close.
