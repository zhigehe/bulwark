South Korea's economy grew 2.2% in 2024, rebounding from the previous year's sharp slowdown, the International Monetary Fund said in report released Friday.

Strong exports and easing inflation, down 1.9% in December, drove the recovery, while financial stability risks somewhat subsided. However, downside risks persist due to geopolitical tensions, semiconductor demand uncertainty, and political unrest following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment in December.

The assessment followed the IMF team's November visit to Seoul for talks with South Korea's finance ministry, Bank of Korea, and other institutions, the report said.
