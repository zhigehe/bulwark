South Korea's top five banks have seen a surge in gold bar sales amid US President Donald Trump's new policies and waning hopes for an early US rate cut, Yonhap News reported Wednesday, citing industry data.

The country's top five banks — KB Financial Group's KB Kookmin, Shinhan Financial Group's Shinhan Bank, Hana Financial Group's Hana Bank, Woori Financial Group's Woori Bank, and NH Nonghyup — sold 24.2 billion won worth of gold bars so far in February, a sharp increase from 7.96 billion won a year ago, the report said.

On Tuesday, Feb. 11, gold bar prices hit their highest level since the gold exchange was launched, reaching 156,230 won per gram, while daily gold trading volume surpassed 100 billion won for the first time, the report said.
