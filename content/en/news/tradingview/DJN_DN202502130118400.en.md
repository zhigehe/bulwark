The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.

1135 ET - MGM Resorts International's outlook on growth for its Las Vegas Strip Resorts unit this year is catching investors' and analysts' attention as shares of the hotel and casino operator reach their largest percent increase since November 2020. The company is targeting growth in Vegas despite the tough Super Bowl comparatives of the first quarter of 2024, UBS and Truist Securities analysts say in separate research notes. MGM says it identified $200M of incremental Ebitda opportunities: 35% of those from revenue initiatives and 65% from cost reduction initiatives, with $150M to be achieved in 2025. Overall, the company is the best performer in the S&P 500 today, according to FactSet. Shares rise 14%, to $39.16. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)

1134 ET — Tariffs won't be a problem for Corsair Gaming, executives say on a call with analysts. The gaming technology company moved the production of most of its U.S.-bound products out of China five years ago during President Trump's first round of tariffs, at which time the company also "planned further actions in case more or expanded tariffs were announced," CFO Michael Potter says. It doesn't have any factory locations in Canada or Mexico. Corsair guides for better-than-expected revenue in 2025, including the effect of tariffs. "Depending on the news coming up next, that might change the picture," COO Thi La says, "but at the moment, we feel pretty good about our supply chain." Shares rise 17%. (connor.hart@wsj.com)

1105 ET - Hewlett Packard Enterprise has shipped its first Nvidia Blackwell family-based technology, the GB200 NVL72, a rack-scale system aimed at service providers and large enterprises for deploying AI clusters. This system uses advanced direct liquid cooling for efficiency and performance, featuring shared-memory, low-latency architecture for AI models over a trillion parameters. It blends Nvidia CPUs, GPUs, networking, and software for handling parallel workloads like GenAI. The GB200 NVL72 includes 72 GPUs, 36 CPUs, and up to 13.5 TB of HBM3e memory with 576 TB/sec bandwidth. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

1054 ET - Fortis's premium valuation is justified by the utility's strong position and incremental capex opportunities, but there looks to be little room for multiple expansionfrom here, Jefferies reckons. It initiates coverage with a hold call and C$67 target price. Jefferies' analysts forecast about 5% compound annual EPS growth for Fortis through 2029, assuming flat foreign exchange rates. Still, they also see limited balance sheet flexibility, which could be exacerbated by forex swings and/or tax reform. Fortis now up 0.7% at C$63.12. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

1039 ET - Living alone comes with a hefty "singles tax," according to Zillow. Solo renters pay an extra $7,562 for a one-bedroom compared to sharing. This tax has increased by over $450 from last year due to rising rents. Couples or roommates save $15,123 annually, making cohabitation financially rewarding. New York City tops the list with a $20,100 annual premium for solo living. The top cities for this tax have remained stable, but Boston jumped from fifth to fourth place, overtaking Washington, D.C., reflecting its escalating rental costs, with average rent at $3,002 in December 2024, 53% above the national average. While solo living offers autonomy, the financial burden is significant, urging renters to weigh their lifestyle against the cost. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

1017 ET - Keyera logged a strong 4Q, with the performance of its liquids infrastructure segment likely to have been the biggest positive surprise for investors, Raymond James' Michael Barth says. Adjusted Ebitda came in at C$313 million, 11% ahead of the analyst's forecast and 8% above the consensus projection. Barth expects the market to react positively, despite distributable cash flow being in line with expectations and no significant incremental news on growth. Raymond James has an outperform call on the shares, which are now up 2.7% at C$42.96.(robb.stewart@wsj.com)

1010 ET - There is a five-month supply of homes for sale in the U.S., up from 4.4 months last year, the highest since early 2019, according to Redfin. Inventory is growing because more sellers are listing homes--new listings increased by 7.4% year over year--while buyer interest wanes, with pending sales down 6%. High housing costs, with median monthly payments nearly at record highs, and a 4.3% rise in home prices, are major deterrents. Mortgage rates are currently at 6.89%, down slightly, but still high compared to pre-and early-pandemic rates. Redfin says there may be an uptick in house hunters soon if mortgage rates start dropping again. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

0959 ET - U.S. housing supply is increasing due to multiple factors, according to Redfin. The fading "mortgage rate lock-in effect" is a key reason. Homeowners with low rates from the pandemic are less reluctant to move despite higher rates now. Homes are staying on the market longer, with January sales taking 56 days on average, the longest since 2020. Demand is cooling as existing home sales dropped 1.7% in January, influenced by a 4.1% rise in median home prices to $418,581, which is 45% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Economic uncertainties like tariffs, federal workforce reductions, and return-to-office policies are also dampening buyer and seller enthusiasm. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

0950 ET - Homebuyers have the most options since 2020, but few are biting because rising housing costs have made monthly payments tough to swallow, Redfin says. Pending home sales in January fell to the lowest level on record aside from the start of the pandemic. They dropped 4.2% month-over- month--the largest decline on a seasonally adjusted basis since August 2023--and 6.3% year-over- year. Meanwhile, active listings of homes for sale rose to the highest level since early in the pandemic. They climbed 0.3% month-over-month on a seasonally adjusted basis in January and 12.9% year-over-year. New listings hit the highest level since July 2022, increasing 1.9% month-over- month and 4.7% year-over-year. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

0945 ET - Unilever's 2025 outlook is probably in line with consensus, but RBC Capital Markets wouldn't be surprised to see first and second quarter consensus coming down. The outlook emphasizes a slow start to 2025, with organic sales growth for the year within the 3%-5% mid-term range versus company compiled consensus at 4.3%. A modest EBIT margin improvement is also seen, with consensus looking for a 30 basis point increase. Analyst James Edwardes Jones says the results were solid, and there was a 1.5 billion euro share buyback thrown in, which is expected to be completed before the ice cream demerger in late 2025. RBC rates Unilever at underperform with a 40 pound price target. Shares fall 6.5% to 44.42 pounds. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

0927 ET - Consumer traffic to fast-food restaurants is expected to remain challenged this year, with orders at burger players flat to down 1%. Wendy's says it expects its 1Q sales to be the low point of the year, and its business to build through the rest of 2025. The chain says it will focus on its value offerings, which executives say are of a higher quality than competitors' options. Wendy's 4Q adjusted earnings per share and sales beat expectations, with promotions such as its Krabby Patty meal boosting orders. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)

0905 ET - Canadian Tire says it is hedged for the majority of its U.S.-sourced goods, but 2026 is the wild card. The retailer's executives say on a call that they purchase about 15% of their goods from the U.S., but for 2025, they have already hedged forward over 80% of their US goods, but warned that there is "margin risk in 2026." The tariff threat introduces a "new zone of uncertainty." The biggest danger for Canadian Tire, however, is the indirect impacts on employment levels and spending habits. The company has been reassessing its product assortment in preparation. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)
