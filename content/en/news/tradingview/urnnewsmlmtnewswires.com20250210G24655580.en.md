Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences has received a patent invalidation request from China's National Intellectual Property Administration, according to a Friday filing with the Shanghai bourse.

The request, filed by Nanjing Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical, targets a patent related to drug compositions based on Chipscreen's Chidamide.

While the request has been accepted by CNIPA, the patent in question remains valid and has not yet been formally reviewed.

Chipscreen Biosciences emphasized that MicroCore, a subsidiary, holds multiple related patents covering Chidamide-based drug compositions, with protection extending until 2042.
