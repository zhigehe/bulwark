(OTC PINK:BHAC) ("**Focus Impact BH3**"), a special purpose acquisition company, and XCF Global Capital, Inc. ("**XCF**"), today announced that on February 5, 2025 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("**SEC**") declared effective the registration statement on Form S-4, as amended (the "**Registration Statement**"), filed with the SEC by Focus Impact BH3 NewCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Focus Impact BH3 ("**NewCo**") and XCF in connection with the previously announced proposed business combination of Focus Impact BH3 and XCF.

This milestone paves the way for Focus Impact BH3 and XCF to complete the business combination, which will result in NewCo becoming a publicly traded company after Focus Impact BH3 and XCF combine in a series of transactions, reinforcing its position as a key player in the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

"XCF represents the future of sustainable aviation fuel, and today's announcement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Focus Impact and XCF," said Carl Stanton, CEO of Focus Impact BH3. "With strong leadership and a clear path to growth, we believe XCF is well-positioned to deliver meaningful impact in both the renewable energy sector and the capital markets."

"We are one step closer to delivering a scalable solution that helps airlines meet their sustainability commitments while delivering long-term value for our investors," said Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF. "With a well-defined growth strategy, XCF is positioned to lead the aviation industry's transition to a more sustainable future."

Upon completion of the business combination, assuming satisfaction of the conditions to the closing of the business combination, including approval of the business combination by Focus Impact BH3's stockholders, the combined company will be renamed "XCF Global, Inc." and its shares of common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols "SAFX" and "SAFXW," respectively, subject to final listing approval.
