McDonald's says consumers across its markets remained pressured in 2024, particularly low-income diners and families, but believes the picture will improve this year. The company says in a 4Q investor call that its financial expectations this year reflect a "gradual stabilization of the macroeconomic and consumer environment." Its financial growth targets don't include any impact from potential new tariffs from the Trump administration, however. McDonald's is up 2.6% premarket. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)
