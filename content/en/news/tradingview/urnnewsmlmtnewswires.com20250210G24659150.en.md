Argosy Property signed lease agreements with two new tenants, according to a Tuesday filing with the New Zealand bourse.

The first agreement is for a 12-year lease with Bascik Transport for Argosy's 6,557-square-meter asset at 224 Neilson Street in Auckland. The lease will begin in mid-April with an annual rental of nearly NZ$1.8 million, subject to a mid-term market review.

The other lease is for 10 years with healthcare company Viatris for the Mt Richmond asset. It will begin in the first quarter of 2026, with an annual rent of nearly NZ$1.9 million, subject to fixed rent increases and a mid-term market review.

The property company also disclosed that its 15,300 square meter warehouse at 224A Neilson Street is on track for completion in August.
