Asker, 12 February 2025. Argeo ASA ("Argeo" or the "Company") has engagedParetoSecurities AS and SpareBank 1 Markets AS as joint global coordinators andjointbookrunners (the "Managers") to advise on and effect a contemplated privateplacement of new shares (the "Offer Shares") in the Company (the "PrivatePlacement") to raise gross proceeds of approx. NOK 150 million (the "OfferSize").

The subscription price per Offer Share in the Private Placement (the "OfferPrice") and the final number of Offer Shares will be determined by theCompany'sboard of directors (the "Board") on the basis of an accelerated bookbuildingprocess to be conducted by the Managers.

Use of proceeds:

The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement will be used tofinance (i) acquisition of long-lead equipment for vessel positioned as #1bidder for a 4-year contract, (ii) geotechnical equipment to enable Argeo'sservice offering on long-term frame agreements, and (iii) general corporatepurposes:

i) Argeo is positioned for a 4-year IMR contract in South America and theCompany will purchase long-lead items for this likely contract.ii) 80% of Argeo's integrated site investigation projects includesgeotechnicalservices which typically consists of 15% of the total contract value. Theseservices are currently subcontracted out and build-up of inhouse capabilitywillgive long-term competitive advantage as well as short payback time asgeotechnical services are important parts of our long-term frame agreements.

Company update:

- Argeo Venture is currently on a 10-month contract with Total EnergiesinNamibia scheduled to be completed mid-march 2025. The vessel had a 60-day yardstay in Q4 2024 for installation of equipment. - Argeo Searcher worked multiclient in Suriname where revenues are onlyrecognized once the data has been processed and sold. - Q4 2024 revenues will be USD 5 million, down from USD 23 million in Q32024,and EBITDA will be negative USD 5.7 million, down from positive USD 5.4million.

The Company has since been awarded a 5-year site investigation frame agreementwith Total Energies, and an 8-year multiclient agreement with Staatolie ofSuriname, in addition to being positioned for 4-year contract in Brazil, finalaward expected Q1 2025.

Per 31 December 2024, firm backlog was USD 14 million for execution in Q12025.

Argeo currently has a total expected backlog of USD ~190 million, includingcontracts in final negotiation stage. The Company estimates 30% EBITDA-marginimplying an estimated EBITDA backlog of USD 57 million, exceeding net debt &leases of USD 44.6 million. Argeo believes its Q2 and Q3 2024 EBITDA are morerepresentative for 2025 than Q4 2024, which implies an annualized run-rate ofUSD ~20 million.See further information in the attached investor presentation dated 12February2025.

The Board may, at its sole discretion, rejectand/or reduce any applications. There is no guarantee that any applicant willbeallocated Offer Shares.

Applicants will receive a pro rata portion of Offer Shares in Tranche 1 andTranche 2 based on their overall allocation in the Private Placement exceptforKistefos AS which will receive its entire allocation in Tranche 2. The Companywill seek to accommodate applicants who request to be allocated Offer SharesinTranche 2 (implying that other investors may receive a larger portion of theirallocation in Tranche 1).

Notification of allocations are expected to be issued by the Manager to theapplicants on or about 13 February 2025 before 09:00 CET (before opening ofmarkets).

Settlement:

The delivery vs. payment (DVP) settlement structure in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2is expected to be facilitated through the delivery of existing andunencumberedshares in the Company, already admitted to trading on Oslo Børs, pursuant to ashare lending agreement between the Company, the Managers, and certainexistingshareholders (the "Share Lending Agreement"). The Offer Shares in Tranche 1willthus become tradable on Oslo Børs directly after the notification ofallocationexpected on or about 13 February 2025 before 09:00 CET (T), and the OfferSharesin Tranche 2 will become tradable after a resolution by the EGM expected on orabout 6 March 2025 (T + 3 weeks = X). The allocation to Kistefos AS in Tranche2may if necessary be treated separately in connection with the settlementprocess.

The date for settlement for Tranche 1 is expected to be on or about 17February2025 (DVP T+2) and settlement for Tranche 2 is expected to be on or about 10March 2025 (DVP X+2), subject to any shortening or extensions of theBookbuilding Period.

The Share Lending Agreement for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 will be settledthroughthe redelivery of (i) new shares in the Company to be resolved issued by theBoard pursuant to the Board Authorization (Tranche 1), and (ii) new shares inthe Company to be issued after a resolution by the EGM (Tranche 2).

The settlement of Offer Shares underTranche 1 will remain final and binding and cannot be revoked, cancelled orterminated by the respective applicants if Tranche 2 is not completed.

Potential subsequent repair offering:

The Board of Directors has considered the Private Placement in light of theequal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act section5-14, section 2.1 of Euronext Oslo Rule Book II and Oslo Børs' Circular no.2/2014, and is of the opinion that the proposed Private Placement is incompliance with these requirements. The equity issuance will be carried out asaprivate placement in order to complete a transaction in an efficient manner tostrengthen the Company's balance sheet. On this basis, and based on anassessment of the current equity markets, the Company's need for equityfunding,deal execution risk and possible alternatives, the Board of Directors hasconsidered the Private Placement to be in the common interest of the Companyandits shareholders. As a consequence of the overall transaction structure, theshareholders' preferential rights will be deviated from.
