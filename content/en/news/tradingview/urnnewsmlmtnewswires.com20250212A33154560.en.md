Computer Modelling Group Ltd. was downgraded to Neutral from Outperformer at CIBC Capital Markets.

Analyst Scott Fletcher lowered his price target on shares of the Calgary-based software company serving the oil and gas industry to $11 from $14.50.

"Despite adjusted EBITDA coming in 8% ahead of consensus, CMG's Q3 results raised some near-term concerns," Fletcher said in a note to clients. "Flat revenue growth (inclusive of a ~2% FX tailwind) and modest margin compression in the core CMG segment (renamed Reservoir & Production), coupled with management commentary suggesting that customers have become increasingly price sensitive and are extending their decision-making timelines, put near-term growth prospects at risk."

"While CMG does appear to have a clear strategy to re-accelerate recurring revenue growth, we are less confident that the company will hit double-digit growth targets in the core business in F2026," the analyst said.

"We remain constructive on the long-term opportunity as CMG expands its presence through both organic and inorganic strategies, but given the uncertain near-term demand outlook, we are downgrading the stock."
