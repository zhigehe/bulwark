France issued 8 billion euros ($8.29 billion) in a new 30-year, May 2056-dated government bond, or OAT, via a bank syndicate on Wednesday, one of the joint lead manager banks said.

Order books for the transaction closed above 115 billion euros, including 2.84 billion in joint lead-manager interest, the same bank said.

The spread on the new 2056-dated OAT was set at 4 basis points above the May 2055 OAT, the same bank said.

Joint lead managers of the transaction were BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Societe Generale.
