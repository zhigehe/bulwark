SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Dairy Council of California is proud to announce the release of its highly anticipated “2025 Trends: Food and Nutrition Trends for Education and Health Professionals,” providing key insights on the evolving landscape of nutrition, public health and food policy.

For over 30 years, Dairy Council of California’s Trends reports have served as a trusted resource for monitoring shifts in food and nutrition, offering valuable insights to help professionals navigate changes in the years ahead. Each edition is carefully reviewed by a committee of third-party experts from leading universities, research institutions, community-based and industry organizations, ensuring the report is evidence-based, relevant, and reflective of diverse communities.

This year’s report highlights four major trends shaping the future of food and nutrition:

* Culture and Equity Are Prioritized in Health Interventions: Exploring the increased focus on culturally relevant nutrition strategies and health equity.
* **Women’s Healthy Aging Is in the Spotlight:** Addressing nutrition and lifestyle factors critical to supporting women’s health across the life span.
* **Food and Nutrition Policy Landscape Evolves:** Examining regulatory shifts, sustainability efforts and the impact of new dietary guidelines on public health.

“As an organization committed to advancing public health through nutrition education and advocacy, we believe these insights are essential for professionals striving to improve community well-being,” said Amy DeLisio, CEO of Dairy Council of California. “The 2025 Trends Report underscores the need for collaborative, evidence-based solutions to create a healthier and more equitable future.”
