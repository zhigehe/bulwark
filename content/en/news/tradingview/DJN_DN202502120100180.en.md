U.S. credit spreads are expected to widen as investors expect fewer interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve after Wednesday's stronger-than-expected inflation data, CreditSights analysts say in a note. The strong inflation data and last week's above-forecast jobs data are expected to shift market expectations "toward rate hikes and away from future rate cuts," CreditSights says. Markets now fully price in the first rate cut of 2025 in December, after the U.S. inflation data, from fully pricing in a cut in September beforehand, LSEG Refinitiv data show. The shift in Fed rate expectations is likely to push U.S. credit spreads wider "as the tailwind of easing monetary policy expectations fades," CreditSights says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
