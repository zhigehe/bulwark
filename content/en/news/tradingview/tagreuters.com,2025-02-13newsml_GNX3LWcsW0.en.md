CORNELIUS, N.C., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Alpha Modus Holdings, Inc. through its subsidiary Alpha Modus, Corp., (“Alpha Modus” or the “Company”), a leading innovator in AI-driven retail and fintech solutions, forecasts substantial growth as its partner, CashX, begins the large-scale deployment of its financial kiosks across a vast network of supermarkets beginning in California and Colorado. With a contracted deployment expected in approximately 10,000 locations, this initiative represents a transformational moment for Alpha Modus and its investors.

"This is a defining moment for Alpha Modus. We see our AI technology revolutionizing the self-service financial kiosk industry, creating an entirely new revenue stream while providing critical services to millions of consumers," said William Alessi, CEO of Alpha Modus. "With projected advertising revenue alone reaching $75 million annually, we plan on delivering scalable, high-margin revenue growth for our investors during the deployment period. This deployment is intended to solidify our market leadership and position Alpha Modus as the backbone of AI-driven financial automation in retail."

**Massive Market Opportunity & Revenue Potential**

Each **AI-powered CashX kiosk** is expected to serve **1,250 unique visitors per month**, reaching **150 million unique visits per year** in the aggregate once all of the kiosks are fully deployed. This high engagement is projected to generate **$75 million in annual ad revenue for Alpha Modus**, significantly boosting Alpha Modus’s financial outlook.

* **Rollout Timeline:** The first kiosks are already operational and being deployed, with full deployment in up to 10,000 locations set for **the end of 2026**.
* **AI Activation:** The integration of **Alpha Modus AI technology** into these kiosks should begin **in the second half of 2025**.
* **Additional Revenue Streams:** Kiosks will offer **GlobeTopper’s** digital services, including prepaid cards, event tickets, cryptocurrency transactions, and remittance solutions—which should expand Alpha Modus’s revenue channels.

Disrupting Retail Finance with AI-Powered Innovation

Alpha Modus’s AI-driven technology enhances CashX AI, an intelligent automation platform designed to power self-service financial kiosks. These kiosks provide essential services such as:

* Prepaid top-ups
* Cryptocurrency purchases
* Remittances & money transfers
* Fraud-resistant, AI-powered transactions

By embedding GlobeTopper’s financial solutions into the CashX ecosystem, Alpha Modus will be expanding its footprint in high-traffic retail environments—offering a data-driven approach to consumer engagement and profitability optimization.

Strategic Market Penetration & Exclusive Industry Rights

Alpha Modus’s expansion is further strengthened by CashX’s partnership with **OPMX**, a premier distributor specializing in the **Hispanic consumer market**, which accounts for **19% of the U.S. population (63+ million people)**. This collaboration should provide Alpha Modus direct access to one of the **fastest-growing retail demographics**, ensuring broad adoption and sustained usage of the kiosks.

Furthermore, **CashX holds an exclusive licensing agreement** with Alpha Modus, with the sole right to use Alpha Modus’s **patented AI technology** within self-service financial kiosks targeting **unbanked and underbanked consumers** in retail food, drug, and convenience stores.

"This partnership uniquely positions Alpha Modus at the intersection of AI, fintech, and retail. By leveraging our exclusive IP, we will be creating a frictionless, data-driven financial experience while capturing significant advertising and service-based reoccurring revenue," added Alessi.
