By Rhiannon Hoyle

Pharmaceuticals company CSL on Tuesday reported a 3% rise in first-half profit, benefiting from further growth in its main blood-plasma business.

Australia-based CSL, which runs a network of plasma-collection centers in the U.S., said its net profit totaled US$2.07 billion in the six months ended Dec. 31. That compared to a US$2.02 billion profit in the year-prior period and market expectations of US$2.09 billion, according to Visible Alpha.

The company declared an interim dividend of US$1.30 per share, compared to US$1.19 a year ago.

When foreign-exchange movements were stripped out, CSL's profit rose by 5% to US$2.11 billion.

It reaffirmed guidance for annual net profit of US$3.2 billion-US$3.3 billion at constant exchange rates. If achieved, that would represent growth of 10-13% on the 2024 fiscal year.
