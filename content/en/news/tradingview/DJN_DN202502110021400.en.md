Kuehne + Nagel will likely tone down its ambitious 2026 targets at its upcoming capital markets day, AlphaValue analyst Kulwinder Rajpal writes. In 2023, the company unveiled plans to grow group EBIT at a compound annual growth rate of 17%-19% between 2019 and 2026, and achieve a conversion rate (EBIT to Gross Profit) of 25%-30% by 2026. Rajpal says consensus never bought into the targets then and doesn't expect the company's fortunes to brighten over the next two years. AlphaValue expects volume growth to remain in the quagmire, and sees marginal headwinds from the abatement of the Red Sea crisis and trade wars. "These factors put the original target well out of sight." Shares rise 0.6% to 205 Swiss francs. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
