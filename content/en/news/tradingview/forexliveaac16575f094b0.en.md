Via Politico:

* The ruling effectively halts a central component of one of Trump’s Day One executive orders commanding his administration to freeze foreign aid for 90 days.

Report is here.

Question continue about how long some of Trump's policies will remain in place. Trump is trying to improve government finances but his team seem ill-prepared to know how to go about it.

His tariff moves, for example, are aimed at raising a trillion USD. This is not going to happen.
