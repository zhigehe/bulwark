Shareholders of the Company can exercise their right to vote also by voting in advance. Instructions for voting in advance can be found in this notice to the Annual General Meeting in section “C. Instructions for the participants of the Annual General Meeting”.

Shareholders, who are registered in the shareholders’ register of the Company held by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date of the Annual General Meeting, have the possibility to follow the Annual General Meeting via a webcast. Shareholders must register for the webcast in advance in accordance with the instructions in section “C. Instructions for the participants of the Annual General Meeting”.

10. Consideration of the remuneration report for the governing bodies

The remuneration report for the governing bodies will be available on the Company’s website at www.outokumpu.com/en/agm2025 on week 10.

11. Resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors

The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the annual remuneration of the Board of Directors would be increased as follows:

* the annual remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors to EUR 186,000 (2024: EUR 180,000),
* the annual remuneration of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors to EUR 100,000 (2024: EUR 96,500),
* the annual remuneration of the Chairman of the Audit Committee or Remuneration Committee to EUR 100,000 (2024: EUR 96,500) if not simultaneously acting as the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and
* the annual remuneration of the other members of the Board of Directors to EUR 77,000 (2024: EUR 75,000).

40% of the annual remuneration would be paid in the Company’s own shares using treasury shares or shares to be purchased from the market at a price formed in public trading and in accordance with the applicable insider regulations. If a Board member, on the date of the Annual General Meeting, owns shares of the Company, which based on the closing price of that day represent a value exceeding the annual remuneration, he or she can opt to receive the remuneration in cash.

The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes that the meeting fees which would be paid also for the Board Committee meetings, will remain unchanged at EUR 800 per meeting for each member of the Board of Directors and at EUR 1,600 when travelling to a meeting held outside the Board member’s country of residence. The meeting fees are paid in cash.

The Shareholders’ Nomination Board comprises Reima Rytsölä, CEO of Solidium Oy, Pekka Pajamo, CFO of Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Jouko Pölönen, President and CEO of Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Outi Antila, Director General of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, and Kari Jordan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Outokumpu.

12. Resolution on the number of the members of the Board of Directors

The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes that the Board of Directors would consist of eight (8) members.

For the sake of organization, if one or more of the persons proposed by the Shareholders’ Nomination Board are not available for election to the Board of Directors for any reason on the date of the meeting, the number of proposed members of the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly.

13. Election of the members of the Board of Directors

The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes that the current members of the Board of Directors, Heinz Jörg Fuhrmann, Kari Jordan, Päivi Luostarinen, Jyrki Mäki-Kala, Petter Söderström and Julia Woodhouse would be re-elected, and that Hilde Merete Aasheim and Olavi Huhtala would be elected as new members, all for the term of office ending at the end of the next Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Board also proposes that Kari Jordan would be re-elected as the Chairman and Jyrki Mäki-Kala would be elected as the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Each of the proposed Board members has consented to their respective appointment and confirmed that they are independent of the Company and its major shareholders excluding Petter Söderström, who is independent of the Company but not of one of its major shareholders, Solidium Oy. Further information on the proposed Board members is available at Outokumpu’s website at www.outokumpu.com and www.outokumpu.com/en/agm2025.

The Nomination Board has considered the composition of the Board of Directors as to its overall structure as well as the individual members’ versatile and mutually complementary professional expertise and experience. The Nomination Board therefore proposes that the Board of Directors is elected as a whole, not each Board member individually.

**14. Resolution on the remuneration of the auditor**

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, that the elected auditor be reimbursed in accordance with the respective invoice approved by the Company.

**15. Election of the auditor**

The auditor’s assignment also includes giving the auditor’s statement on the discharge of the members of the Board of Directors and the CEO from liability and on the proposal of the Board of Directors for distribution of profit.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has informed the Company that Samuli Perälä, APA, will act as the responsible auditor.

The Audit Committee has prepared its recommendation in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014). The Audit Committee hereby confirms that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party and that no clause of the kind referred to in paragraph 6 of Article 16 of the EU Audit Regulation, which would restrict the choice by the Annual General Meeting as regards the appointment of the auditor, has been imposed upon it.

16. Election of the sustainability reporting assurance provider

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, that the sustainability audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy be elected as the sustainability reporting assurance provider for the term of office ending at the end of the next Annual General Meeting.
