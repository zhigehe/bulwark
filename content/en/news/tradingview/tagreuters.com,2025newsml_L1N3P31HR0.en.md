Spot basis bids for corn were steady to up at elevators and river terminals around the U.S. Midwest on Wednesday, a spot check showed, as futures climbed. Soy basis bids were unchanged.

\* The corn basis rose by a cent at an elevator in Council Bluffs, Iowa and by 2 cents at a river terminal in Morris, Illinois.

\* In its monthly report on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed world corn ending stocks below trade expectations, which supported futures, according to analysts.

\* The USDA projected U.S. soybean end-of-season supplies above market expectations.

\* CBOT March corn (CH25) settled up 6-1/4 cents at $4.90-1/4 a bushel.

\* CBOT March soybeans (SH25) settled down 15-3/4 cents to $10.27-3/4 per bushel.
