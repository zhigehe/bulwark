Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybean and wheat futures weakened on Friday on renewed concerns over the risk for potential trade disputes to hurt demand for U.S. farm products, analysts said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. Grain traders worry the duties may spark retaliation from importers that would dent U.S. crop sales.

"Any type of moves like this may have a little pushback in some ways against the U.S.," said Rich Nelson, chief strategist at commodity brokerage Allendale. "Certainly, from a psychological basis, any evolving tariff is a question."

Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. U.S. levies against China drew a measured response from Beijing that did not include tariffs on crops in a relief for grain traders.

Most-active CBOT corn futures were down 9 cents at $4.86-1/4 a bushel by 12 p.m. CST (1800 GMT) but remained close to a 15-month peak of $4.98-1/2 reached on Wednesday.

Soybean futures fell 11 cents to $10.49-1/2 a bushel, after rising on Wednesday to a six-month peak of $10.79-3/4. Wheat slid 7 cents to $5.80-3/4 a bushel, down from a 3-1/2 month high of $5.92-1/2.

Improved rains in Argentina helped drag down the markets after hot, dry weather in January, traders said. Showers this week delivered the country's soy crop "from the inferno," the Rosario grains exchange said.

Argentina is the world's biggest exporter of soymeal and soyoil and No. 3 corn exporter.

Traders are also keeping an eye on cold weather in Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter, due to concerns about potential damage to its crop. A wheat export quota set by Moscow implied that its shipments will fall sharply next year.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is slated to update its global supply and demand estimates in a monthly report.
