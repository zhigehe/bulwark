Liaoning Chengda's controlling shareholder will change amid the election of its board of directors, according to a Shanghai Stock Exchange filing on Thursday.

Shaoguan Gaoteng Enterprise Management will become the Chinese biotechnology company's controlling shareholder as it owns 15.3% of the company. Shaoguan Gaoteng will also elect a majority of directors as it takes controlling rights in the company.

Liaoning State-Owned Assets Management is currently the company's controlling shareholder and actual shareholder. None will take over as actual controller when the state-owned organization relinquishes its controlling stake in the company.

The company's shares slumped over 4% in recent trade.
