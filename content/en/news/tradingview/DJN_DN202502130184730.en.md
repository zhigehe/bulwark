Kakao may post weak 1Q earnings due to its apparent lack of competitiveness in display advertising and its saturated online-gifting business, Nomura analysts Angela Hong and Won Kang write in a note. The South Korean mobile internet company's profit margins may also deteriorate in 1Q due to expected weak revenue from its paid-content business and the burden of fixed costs, they say. Kakao aims to enhance its advertising and e-commerce competitiveness with generative AI-based search tools, but its 2025 advertising business outlook remains uncertain, they add. Nomura raises its target price for Kakao by 5.4% to KRW39,000 but maintains a neutral rating. Shares are 3.0% lower at KRW39,000. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)
