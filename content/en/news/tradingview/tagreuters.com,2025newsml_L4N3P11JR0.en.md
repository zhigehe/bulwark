\*\* Shares of credit card giant American Express fall as much as 3.4%; last down 2.3% at $309.64

\*\* Q1 expectations are "too high", says AXP CFO Christophe Le Caillec at UBS Financial Services conference

\*\* Investors and analysts expect Q1 revenue growth to be pretty flat sequentially, but it cannot be flat - Le Caillec

\*\* AXP expects Q1 revenue growth to be down sequentially due to one less day in the quarter and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar

\*\* Brokerage BTIG says it was a "surprising negative guidance" to Q1 revenue, adding that it is now inclined to look at the low end of AXP's 2025 revenue growth forecast of 8% to 10%

\*\* Underperformance in Q1 is also "particularly surprising" versus the strength in Q4 - brokerage

\*\* AXP stock jumped 58.4% in 2024
