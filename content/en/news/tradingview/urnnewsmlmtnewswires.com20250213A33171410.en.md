US industrial production is expected to rise by 0.3% in January, based on a survey compiled by Bloomberg, after a 0.9% gain in the previous month.

The data are scheduled to be released at 9:15 a.m. ET Friday.

Manufacturing production is expected to increase by 0.1%, after a 0.6% gain in December. The Institute for Supply Management reading for manufacturing production rose to 52.2 in January from 49.9 in December, now indicating modest expansion, while the new orders reading rose to 55.1 from 52.1.

The average factory workweek slipped to 40.0 hours in January from 40.1 hours in the previous month, while manufacturing payrolls rose by only 3,000 jobs. As a result, the aggregate hours index for manufacturing, a combination of hours and employment, fell by 0.2% in January.

Utilities production is expected to post another weather-related gain after rising by 2.1% in December, while the mining component is forecast to slow its pace of growth after a 1.8% gain.

Capacity utilization is expected to tick up slightly to 77.7%, after rising to 77.6% in the previous month.
