The benchmark KOSPI rose 0.3% to close at 2,591 points on Friday, extending gains for the fourth straight session and hitting its highest level since late October 2024.

For the week, the benchmark index also advanced 2.7%, its biggest weekly gain since early January.

Markets appeared relieved after US President Donald Trump signed a memo on reciprocal tariffs, signaling no immediate tariff imposition.

However, the US continues to investigate unfair trade practices, with South Korea, among its key targets, adding to market uncertainty.

In response, South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok stated that the government would review non-tariff barriers and vulnerabilities to address the plans.

In economic news, the jobless rate in South Korea fell to 2.9% in January, down from Decemberâ€™s three-year high of 3.7%.

Among key stocks, SK Hynix (0.7%), Celltrion (1.6%), Hanwha Aerospace (3.3%), and Hyundai Mobis (2.7%) were the top performers.
