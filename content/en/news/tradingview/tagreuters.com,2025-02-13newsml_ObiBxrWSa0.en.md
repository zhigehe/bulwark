SpareBank 1 Østlandet achieved a consolidated profit after tax of NOK 3 356million (NOK 2 222 million) in 2024. The return on equity was 15.8 % (11.3 %).This is the highest return for the group in 30 years. A solid development inthebank's core business is behind the good result, in addition to accountingeffects from the merger between Fremtind Forsikring and Eika Forsikring.

In addition to good results, the group also experienced significant eventsduring the past year. The year began with the news on 3 January of a signedletter of intent for a merger with Totens Sparebank. Extensive work on themerger plans was carried out throughout the year, leading to the legal mergerbeing completed as intended on 1 November 2024.

Last autumn, the bank signed a new agreement to be the preferred bank fordelivering LOfavør products to LO members. On 1 October, the market area wasexpanded southwestward by crossing the county borders to Buskerud andestablishing an office in Drammen. The group has also decided to merge ourthreereal estate agencies during the first half of 2025 to create a unified effortunder the EiendomsMegler 1 Østlandet brand. On 1 April, Klara-Lise Aasen tookover as the new Group CEO, succeeding Richard Heiberg.

The group met all its financial targets in 2024. The return on equity exceededthe revised target of 13 %. The bank's CET-1 capital ratio at the end of 2024was 16.8 %, compared to a solidity target of 16.1 %. The bank's Board ofDirectors proposes a cash dividend of NOK 10.30 (NOK 7.80) per equity capitalcertificate, which is about 60 % of the owners' share of the profit - comparedto a targeted dividend share of at least 50%.

Furthermore, the Board of Directors is proposing to the Supervisory Board topaya customer dividend of NOK 470 million (NOK 381 million) and to allocate NOK42million (NOK 6 million) for gifts. The bank places great emphasis ondistributing significant funds to the local community. Customer dividends areaneffective way to give back to the community we are part of, along with giftallocations and the activities of the savings bank foundations.

SpareBank 1 Østlandet's group profit after tax for the fourth quarter of 2024was NOK 701 million (NOK 574 million). The return on equity was 11.5 % (11.3%).The underlying development in the bank's results was very solid, with goodgrowth in both net interest income and commission income.

The bank experienced solid housing mortgage loan growth during the quarter.Underlying growth in the mortgage portfolio was just below 2 %. The gooddevelopment seems to have continued into 2025, with a large number of mortgageapplications submitted in January. The volume development in the corporatemarket was weaker in the fourth quarter, reflecting low market growth.However,there are signs of stronger growth in the coming quarters.

The fourth quarter was another quarter with high commission income. Turnoverforthe real estate agents was helped by good market growth, but also increasedmarket shares. Insurance commissions are at their highest ever, driven byincreased insurance premiums, good sales, and lower claims payments.

Loss costs were NOK 122 million (NOK 39 million) in the fourth quarter. As inthe previous quarter, a known engagement with previous provisions was thereasonfor unusually high individual loss provisions.

The group's operating costs in the fourth quarter were NOK 764 million (NOK594million). The increase in operating costs in the parent bank by NOK 100millionfrom the same quarter in 2023 was mainly due to the inclusion of TotensSparebank's cost base and integration costs. There was also high growth inpersonnel costs outside Totens Sparebank related to increased investments incustomer-facing positions primarily made at the beginning of 2024, as well asincreased resources related to compliance. In addition, IT costs increased,especially via the alliance. In the subsidiaries, the quarter wascharacterizedby large extraordinary costs, in the form of write-downs and provisions justbelow NOK 40 million.

"The activity level in our core business has been high also through the lastquarter of the year. Commission income from savings, insurance, and realestatebrokerage is strong, and at the end of the year, we have volume growth in bothdeposits and loans that is higher than market growth. We had the pleasure ofwelcoming 82 new colleagues from Totens Sparebank from 1 November, and we arewell underway with the important integration work, which will furtherstrengthenour customer relationships in the Lake Mjøsa-region. In October, we opened anewoffice in Drammen to strengthen our presence in this growth region. Thereception in a city with strong bank competition has exceeded all expectationsand yielded good results so far. I am grateful that customers continue to showus trust, also through a good start to 2025," says CEO Klara-Lise Aasen
