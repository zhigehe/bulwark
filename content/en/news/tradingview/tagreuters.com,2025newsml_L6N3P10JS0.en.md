(The Insurer) - MS Amlin has launched a credit and political risk insurance (CPRI) offering in Dubai as part of its expansion in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

The new offering will be led by Osama Elshiekh as senior underwriter for CPRI. He will report to Vipul Gupta, senior executive officer for MS Amlin MENA.

Elshiekh most recently spent three years as a senior underwriter for CPRI at The Hartford.

This followed an eight-year stint at the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit, where he held roles including UAE country manager, business development manager and insurance underwriter.

Gupta said that demand for CPRI cover in the region is primarily being driven by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

“We see exciting opportunities in India, and on the African continent, which are both experiencing a significant influx of foreign investment. We believe this will create growing demand across a number of speciality lines, most notably CPRI,” said Gupta.

The CPRI offering builds on MS Amlin’s existing presence in Dubai, where it underwrites hull, cargo, political violence and political risk insurance. It also offers financial lines cover, which was launched in 2024 with Tom Horswill as lead.
