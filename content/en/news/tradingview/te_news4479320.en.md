Malaysia's economy grew 5.1% in 2024, exceeding the government's 4%–5% target and accelerating from a downwardly revised 3.6% in 2023.

According to the central bank, growth was driven by stronger household spending, supported by favorable labor market conditions, policy measures, and healthy household balance sheets.

Investment growth also picked up, fueled by strong investment approvals and progress on multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors.

Externally, economic expansion was supported by recovering exports amid steady global growth, the ongoing tech upcycle, and increased tourist arrivals and spending.
