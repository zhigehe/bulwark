European natural gas futures fell toward €57 per megawatt-hour, pulling back from two-year highs, but concerns over storage levels and colder weather provided support.

Europe's gas storage is 48.48% full, the lowest for this time of year since 2022, raising worries about refilling for next winter.

With more windless days, colder temperatures, and reduced Russian gas transit via Ukraine, countries have relied heavily on reserves.

Gas consumption is expected to rise 17% this month, driven by heating demand, and freezing weather in Northwest Europe could strain stockpiles further.

Traders are also watching US tariffs, potential LNG cost increases, and ongoing discussions on restoring Russian gas flows.
