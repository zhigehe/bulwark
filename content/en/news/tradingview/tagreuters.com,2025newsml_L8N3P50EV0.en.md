\*\* Bernstein upgrades Randstad to "outperform" from "underperform", saying the world's biggest staffing firm can benefit from the improving yet weak labour markets

\*\* The brokerage says North America (about 25% of Randstad's gross profit) and temps (about 70% of gross profit) should lead any market recovery, with gross margins to follow

\*\* It notes that PMIs are improving in the U.S. since October and in Europe since January, and points to stabilising job postings in the U.S., France, Germany and Britain

\*\* It says U.S. temp numbers appear to have troughed in October, with the ratio of U.S. job openings to unemployment claims rising since then

\*\* Randstad's number of temps at work has also troughed, Bernstein adds

\*\* It also notes the stock's valuation is close to all-time lows, with risk now skewed to the upside; raises PT by 35% to 50 euros

($1 = 0.9552 euros)
