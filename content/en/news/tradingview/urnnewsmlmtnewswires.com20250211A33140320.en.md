Charles Schwab Corp said Tuesday it priced a secondary offering by TD Group US Holdings of about 165.4 million shares of the company's common stock at $79.25 per share for expected gross proceeds of about $13.1 billion.

The offering is expected to close this Wednesday, subject to customary closing conditions. Following the completion of the secondary offering and the previously announced $1.5 billion share repurchase by the company from TD, TD will have disposed of all its shares in Charles Schwab.

The company said it will not receive any proceeds from the offering.
