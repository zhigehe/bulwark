DoorDash late Tuesday swung to a smaller-than-expected profit in the fourth quarter, while the food delivery company beat Wall Street's expectations for revenue.

The company reported earnings per share of $0.33, compared with a $0.39 loss a year earlier. The bottom line fell short of the consensus on FactSet for $0.34 in EPS. Revenue advanced 25% to $2.87 billion, higher than the Street's $2.84 billion view.

Shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trade.

Marketplace gross order value — the total value of all orders completed on its marketplaces, including taxes, tips and membership fees — increased 21% annually to $21.28 billion, above consensus for $20.93 billion.

Orders grew 19% to 685 million, topping the market view for 674.8 million, the company said.

DoorDash forecasts first-quarter marketplace gross order value at $22.6 billion to $23 billion, higher than market expectations of $22.41 billion.
