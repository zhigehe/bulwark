Kering's results should reassure investors that trends are modestly improving, RBC Capital Markets analysts Piral Dadhania and Richard Chamberlain say in a note. The French luxury group reported 4Q revenue of 4.39 billion euros, down 12% on year. Gucci reported a 24% decline in revenue, but retail sales improved compared with 3Q. Revenue acceleration at Gucci was less pronounced compared with peers, which suggests the relative performance gap hasn't yet closed, the analysts say. However, with the new brand CEO Stefano Cantino apparently willing to make bold changes, including changing creative director, the worst could be left behind, they say. "The timing for a potential reset remains unclear at this stage." Shares are down nearly 41% over the past 12 months. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)
