By David Winning

SYDNEY--AGL Energy said its half-year underlying profit fell by 6.5%, prompting the electricity generator and retailer to pare its dividend payout to shareholders.

AGL reported a net profit of 97 million Australian dollars (US$60.9 million) in the six months through December, compared to A$576 million a year ago. Revenue rose by 15% to A$7.13 billion.

Underlying profit, which strips out one-off items, totaled A$373 million in the six-month period, down from A$399 million a year ago. Directors of AGL declared an interim dividend of 23 cents a share, down from 26 cents a year ago. AGL's dividend policy is to pay out 50-75% of underlying profit after tax.
