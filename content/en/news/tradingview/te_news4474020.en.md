The New Zealand dollar fell to around $0.563 on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive session of losses as the U.S. dollar strengthened following the latest tariff developments.

President Donald Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect on March 4, fueling concerns over a potential global trade war.

Market participants are also closely watching Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for insights into the central bank’s policy outlook.

Additionally, growing expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will implement a third consecutive supersized rate cut next week continue to weigh on the currency.
