Nordic markets are seen opening slightly lower, with IG calling the OMXS30 down 0.2% at around 2653. Stock markets defied new steel tariffs yesterday as European equity markets rose to new all-time highs, while U.S. stocks also moved higher, SEB analysts say in a note. President Trump's planned 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum will cover all trading partners, include processed steel products, and will enter into force on March 4. Chinese stock markets are under moderate pressure today and both U.S. and European stock market futures are pointing slightly down. The highlight of the day is testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in Congress. The OMXS30 closed at 2658.29, OMXN40 at 2608.05 and OBX at 1401.79. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
