Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira this week indicated that the selection panel for the new Bank of Thailand governor will be set up by March, noted Nomura.

If so, this would be well ahead of the normal schedule — which is by end-June — and could catch the attention of markets earlier, said the bank. In 2020, the selection process wasn't finalized until late July, owing to an extension of the application period.

At that time, the decision was made relatively quickly — within two weeks after the extension.

According to the BoT Act, the seven-member selection committee, which will be appointed by the finance minister, will shortlist no less than two candidates for the final selection at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term on Sept. 30.
