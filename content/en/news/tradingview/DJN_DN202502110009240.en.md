By Najat Kantouar

Entain said Chief Executive Officer Gavin Isaacs agreed to step down from his role with immediate effect after five months in the role.

The sports-betting and gambling group said Tuesday that current non-executive chair, Stella David, would replace Isaacs on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is found.

David was previously interim CEO from December 2023 until September, when Isaacs took on the CEO role.

Meanwhile, the London-listed group said it expects to report 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization at the top of the 1.04 billion-1.10 billion pound ($1.29 billion-$1.35 billion) guidance range.
