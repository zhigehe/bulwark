Meiji Yasuda Life's purchase of Legal & General America will help reinforce the Japan-based life insurer's credit profile through diversification and expansion to the US market, Fitch Ratings said in a Monday release.

The inclusion of Banner Life Insurance in the purchase will help Maiji Yasuda Life gain footing in the US individual life insurance market and pension risk transfer segment, Fitch said.

The acquisition will also boost the life insurer's consolidated core profit by about 9 billion yen yearly and modestly raise overseas core profit to about 18% of the group total.

The purchase should have a low and manageable impact on the life insurer's capitalization and leverage, with a moderate decline in its economic solvency ratio, Fitch said.

The group's solid franchise in Japan should help support its overall creditworthiness, according to the rating agency.

Favorable conditions stemming from a positive investment spread, healthy life insurance underwriting amid a modestly growing profitable third sector, and lower interest rate risk also support the group's credit profile, Fitch said.
