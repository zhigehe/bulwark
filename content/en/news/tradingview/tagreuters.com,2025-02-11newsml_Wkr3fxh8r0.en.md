Phase Holographic

Recent technical progress has led the Board of Directors of Phase Holographic Imaging (PHI) to decide to focus resources on the company's clinical product development program. In relation to this, the Board of Directors has, in discussion with CEO Anders Månsson, decided to initiate the search for a new CEO to lead the ambitious development that lies ahead.

Anders will step down immediately and assist with the transition. Ivan Jurkovic, PHI board member and Altium group CFO, will serve as the acting CEO of PHI during the recruitment process. In his current technology developer role, PHI's founding board member and former CEO, Peter Egelberg, will assist in product development and technical matters.

"I was recruited for the CEO position in PHI as an interim assignment. Now, it will be shorter than originally anticipated. Still, I understand the desire of our largest shareholder, Alitum, for a more direct level of involvement now that their stake in the company is even larger following the recent rights issue. I wish both Altium and PHI the best of luck going forward", says Anders Månsson.

"We appreciate what Anders has accomplished in this short but transforming period for PHI. With the new capital from the share issue, we will now set a new direction for the company", says Chairman Goran Dubravcic.
