Urals crude differentials were unchanged on Friday, while Azeri BTC daily oil loadings from Ceyhan were set to decline 6% in March.

Azeri BTC crude oil exports from Turkey's Ceyhan port have been set at 16.99 million barrels in March, up from 16.33 million in February, a schedule seen by Reuters showed on Friday.

On a daily basis oil loadings of the grade from Ceyhan will decline 6% in March from the February plan, Reuters calculations showed, as the next month is three days longer.

Chevron is speeding up its expansion of Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield, two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters, raising its output to around 1% of global crude supply.
