Brent crude oil futures fell over 1.5% to below $76 per barrel, ending a three-day rally, as rising US crude stockpiles and hotter-than-expected inflation reduced hopes for rate cuts.

US crude inventories grew by 4.1 million barrels last week, exceeding forecasts for a 3 million-barrel rise.

Also, the latest US inflation data raised doubts about the Fedâ€™s ability to cut rates soon, with Jerome Powell signaling no rush to ease policy.

Higher rates slow economic activity, potentially weakening oil demand.

Meanwhile, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude output estimate to 13.59 million bpd, up from 13.55 million bpd.
