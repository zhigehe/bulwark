Producer prices in Norway surged by 18.1% year-on-year in January 2025, marking the sharpest increase since December 2022 and accelerating from a 9.3% rise in the previous month.

The broad uptick was mainly driven by a solid increase in prices for oil and natural gas extraction (37.5% vs. 17% in December) and energy goods (29.1% vs. 11%).

Meanwhile, costs declined at a slower pace for electricity, gas, and steam (-8.4% vs. -22.2%), while price growth for manufacturing eased (5.6% vs. 6.1%).

Excluding energy goods, producer prices rose 6.2% year-on-year in January, down from a 6.9% increase in December.

On a monthly basis, the PPI jumped 4.7%, the highest since October 2023, following a 1.1% gain in the previous period.
