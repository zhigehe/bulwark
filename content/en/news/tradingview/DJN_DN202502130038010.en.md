Siemens first-quarter results are stronger than expected, Berenberg analysts Philip Buller and Scott Humphreys say in a research note. Siemens posted a 7% and 2% beat in orders in its digital industries and smart infrastructure divisions, respectively. There is plenty to like in the German conglomerate's results, with the only modest disappointment being the mobility segment, the analysts say. "We expect these results to be received well in today's trading, noting that the company's fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged." (nina.kienle@wsj.com)
