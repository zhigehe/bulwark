The benchmark KOSPI climbed 1.4% to close at 2,583 points on Thursday, hitting a three-month high and extending its winning streak to three consecutive sessions, driven by strong performances across key sectors.

Market sentiment was lifted as possible exemptions for the auto and pharmaceutical sectors were considered in U.S. President Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs on countries taxing U.S. imports.

Additionally, U.S. and Russian presidents agreed to talks to end the Ukraine war, boosting reconstruction stocks despite concerns over hotter-than-expected US inflation data.

Among major stock indexes, chipmaker SK Hynix soared 4.8%, while battery giant LG Energy Solutions jumped 5.8%.

Additionally, automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp surged 5.3% and 2.8%, respectively.

Other notable increases were seen from excavator maker HD Hyundai Construction Equipment, which climbed 9.5%, and steelmaker Posco Holdings, which rose 6.9%.
