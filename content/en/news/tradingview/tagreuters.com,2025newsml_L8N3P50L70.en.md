\*\* Berenberg sees good growth in 2025 for food manufacturing, with all flavours and fragrances companies outperforming an expected 3% growth on average in end markets

\*\* According to the broker, volume growth in end markets will be supported by increasing promotional activity on the back of an acceleration in innovation launches

\*\* "This scenario seems to be most positive for categories such as beauty, personal care, and ready-to-drink beverages," the broker says

\*\* It upgrades Givaudan to "buy" from "hold", seeing a new era of profitability for the Swiss fragrance and flavour maker

\*\* It says Givaudan is best placed to benefit from growth this year, given its over 50% exposure to the above categories

\*\* "With consistently higher FCF conversion (16% sales) and ROIC than peers (14%), we argue that Givaudan deserves a valuation premium," the broker says

\*\* It flags that Symrise's self-help journey will take time, as required investments in IT and changes in the company's culture could limit margin expansion over the next two years

\*\* It sees International Flavors & Fragrances on-track to reduce its debt ratio to 2.5x by the end of 2025, expecting management to be now able to focus entirely on improving its execution in the remaining business
