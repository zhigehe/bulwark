US benchmark equity indexes were lower ahead of Friday's close after data showed the economy added fewer jobs than projected in January, while a survey pointed to surging inflation expectations among consumers.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3% at 19,526, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 fell 0.9% each to 44,332.3 and 6,028.2, respectively. Energy was the sole gainer, while all other sectors declined, with consumer discretionary seeing the biggest drop.

Total nonfarm payrolls in the US rose by 143,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The consensus was for a 175,000 increase, according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg.

US consumer sentiment reached its lowest level since last July, while year-ahead inflation expectations hit the highest since November 2023, preliminary February results from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed.

The US two-year yield was up 7.9 basis points at 4.29%, while the 10-year rate added 5.5 basis points to 4.49%.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 0.6% at $71.01 a barrel.
