Wihlborgs Fastigheter AB

Wihlborgs is acquiring seven property companies with eight properties from Granitor with a transfer of ownership on 1 April 2025. The portfolio consists of the Perrongen 1 (Clarion Hotel SeaU) and Regula 1 (including Scandic hotels) investment properties in Helsingborg, the Kajutan 1, Sjömannen 1 and Sjömannen 2 investment properties in Malmö and the Jöns Petter Borg 16 investment property in Lund as well as the Brysselkålen 1 and Jöns Petter Borg 15 development properties in Lund. The goal is to strengthen Wihlborgs' existing clusters in the Swedish areas and to offer new opportunities to tenants.

The six investment properties were built between 2007 and 2022 and comprise a total of approximately 51,000 square metres. Around half of the lettable area at the investment properties are offices and the other half is hotels. The two development properties comprise 82,000 square metres of land for businesses and 12,000 square metres GFA for offices.

Six modern investment properties in strategic locations

Clarion Hotel SeaU (the Strawberry Group) is the sole tenant at the Perrongen 1 leasehold of 17,100 square metres, with an agreement that extends until 2040. The hotel is Helsingborg’s largest, with 250 rooms and a conference hall that holds 1,250 people.

Regula 1, located in Oceanhamnen in central Helsingborg with a view over SeaU and the water, comprises 10,800 square metres across 14 floors. The hotel portion (7,200 square metres) is leased by Scandic Hotels under a lease extending until 2042. The office portion (3,600 square metres) is fully let.

Wihlborgs already has a portfolio of approximately 180,000 square metres in central Helsingborg, including Helsingborg C and the landmark Prisma building (Ursula 1) in Oceanhamnen.

Kajutan 1 is an office property of 3,700 square metres in Västra hamnen, close to Dockan in Malmö, where Wihlborgs currently has a portfolio of 150,000 square metres. Malmö Central Station is just a few minutes away by public transport. In addition to offices, the property includes conference facilities and restaurants/cafés. Right nearby is Sjömannen 1 and 2, two modern office properties totalling 13,200 square metres.

Jöns Petter Borg 16 in southern Lund is an office property of 6,600 square metres with good transportation links close to Gastelyckan.

The total rental value for 2025 amounts to SEK 171 million and rental income to SEK 163 million. The occupancy rate for the investment properties is 95 percent and the surplus ratio is 80 percent. The estimated net operating income for 2025 amounts to SEK 130 million. All of the properties are certified Miljöbyggnad Guld, with the exception of Perrongen 1, which is certified Miljöbyggnad Silver. World Trade Center (WTC) business centres, with co-working spaces and office hotels, are located at Regula 1, Sjömannen 1 and 2 as well as Jöns Petter Borg 16.

Development properties in Lund for industry and offices

Brysselkålen 1 is an undeveloped property of approximately 82,000 square metres in Hasslanda in southern Lund, with an expected site coverage ratio of 50 to 60 percent. This is a unique opportunity to develop one of Lund’s largest undeveloped properties within a development plan, with facilities for industrial operations similar to those built and being constructed by Wihlborgs in the same area for Inpac, BPC and NOTE Lund. The acquisition of Brysselkålen 1 means that Wihlborgs will be able to achieve a critical mass in terms of management volume in the industrial/logistics segment in Lund, just as Wihlborgs has in the corresponding business areas in Malmö and Helsingborg.

In front of Jöns Petter Borg 16 is the undeveloped Jöns Petter Borg 15 property with development rights comprising 12,000 square metres GFA for offices, with retail on the ground floor.

**The transactions**

The underlying property value is SEK 2,425 million. A deduction of 25 percent for deferred tax on the investment properties totals approximately SEK 38 million. Seven property owning companies are being acquired.

The purchase is being financed with available funds under existing credit agreements.

“Wihlborgs is passionate about the Öresund region, and this acquisition allows us to make interesting additions in all three Swedish cities. Good locations, good content in the portfolio under management and development properties in Lund, just where some of our most recent successful projects have been completed. This creates space for additional establishments, which is important for the growth of the city,” says **Ulrika Hallengren, CEO of Wihlborgs.**
