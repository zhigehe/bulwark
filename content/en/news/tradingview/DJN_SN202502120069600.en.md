OPEC leaves forecasts for demand growth unchanged

Oil futures looked to post a loss Wednesday, their first in four sessions, after official U.S. data revealed a third straight weekly climb in U.S. crude supplies.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, has indicated that the central bank will hold interest rates steady "for longer," despite President Donald Trump's calls for lower rates in order to boost the economy.

Price moves

* West Texas Intermediate crude CL00 for March delivery CL.1 CLH25 fell $1.07, or 1.5%, to $72.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Market drivers

Crude's weakness on Wednesday stems from the Federal Reserve keeping a hawkish outlook in place, despite Trump's request for the Fed to cut rates in order to spur investment, Alex Hodes, director of energy-market strategy for StoneX, said in Wednesday's newsletter.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the economy is in a good place and that the central bank will not cut interest rates further, but he said the Fed is prepared to do so if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation falls more quickly than anticipated.

Meanwhile, separate U.S. government data showing a sharp rise in consumer prices in January and a third straight weekly climb in domestic crude supplies contributed to oil's price decline.

The oil futures market "almost immediately took on a heavier tone in the wake of the CPI release, with WTI turning lower in sympathy with stocks and other risk assets," said Tyler Richey, co-editor at Sevens Report Research.

"The hawkish market reaction underscored that higher-for-longer Fed policy is becoming increasingly likely in 2025," he told MarketWatch. "And that ultimately raises the risk that restrictive rates choke off growth and tip the economy over a fragile edge into a recession, a historically demand-crippling phase of the economic cycle for oil and refined products."

A report from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, meanwhile, showed that commercial crude inventories climbed for a third week in a row, up 4.1 million barrels for the week that ended Feb. 7.

The data were expected to show a rise of 4.5 million barrels on average, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a crude inventory increase of 9.04 million barrels, according to a source citing the data.

The EIA also reported a weekly supply decline of 3 million barrels for gasoline, while distillate inventories edged up by 100,000 barrels. The survey forecast an inventory increase of 1.3 million barrels for gasoline and a supply decline of 1.6 million barrels for distillates.

U.S. oil production edged up by 16,000 barrels to 13.494 million barrels per day in the latest week, the EIA said, while crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., Nymex delivery hub rose by 900,000 barrels to 21.8 million barrels.

Demand for gasoline climbed, with total finished motor gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, at 8.576 million barrels per day in the latest week, versus 8.328 million bpd from a week earlier.

Traders also looked to a monthly report released Wednesday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The group said it expects global crude demand to grow by 1.4 million barrels a day in 2025 and 2026, unchanged from its January forecast. It forecast total world demand at 105.20 million barrels per day for 2025 and at 106.63 million barrels per day for 2026.
