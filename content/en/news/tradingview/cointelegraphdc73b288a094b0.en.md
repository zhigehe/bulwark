**What is Tether (USDt)?** 

*Tether’s USDt is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a real-world asset.*

Unlike many cryptocurrencies known for their price swings, Tether’s USDt is designed to maintain a consistent price tied to the US dollar. This price stability makes Tether an appealing option for investors who want to avoid market volatility while exploring the crypto space.

By enabling trading on exchanges and acting as a store of value, Tether has played a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. It was also a pioneer in popularizing stablecoins, offering a feasible way of using conventional currencies in digital format.

***Did you know?** Tether’s story began in 2014 as a startup called “Realcoin.” Just a few months later, it was rebranded as Tether. The company behind it also changed its name to Tether Limited to reflect its mission of tethering digital assets to fiat currencies.*

 **How does Tether maintain its peg?** 

*USDt is not, by definition, an appreciating or depreciating asset, so it can act as a liquidity tool and hedge against market volatility. Tether’s value is entirely dependent on its reserves.*

Tether maintains its stable value by being pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. This means each USDt token is backed by reserves equivalent to its circulating supply. These reserves include traditional currency, cash equivalents and other assets.

USDt tokens are issued by Tether Limited when equivalent fiat reserves are deposited into their accounts, and they can be redeemed for fiat by businesses integrated with the system. Tether minimizes the price fluctuations that characterize most cryptocurrencies by maintaining full backing.

However, the company has faced criticism over the years for a perceived lack of transparency in proving its reserves, which has raised questions about whether all USDt tokens are fully backed at all times.

***Did you know?** In August 2024, Tether announced the launch of a stablecoin pegged to the United Arab Emirates dirham. Like other Gulf currencies, the dirham is pegged to the US dollar. Tether also issues tokens pegged to the euro, the Mexican peso, the offshore Chinese yuan and gold.*

 **The technology behind Tether: How does Tether work?** 

*USDt operates as a second-layer token on established blockchains, meaning that it doesn’t have its own blockchain but relies on other blockchains to facilitate its transactions.*

Initially, Tether was issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer protocol but is now available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron and Algorand, among others. This multichain support makes Tether versatile and easily accessible across different blockchain ecosystems.

Tether’s transparency is another important aspect. Through a system known as proof-of-reserves, Tether emphasizes that the reserves backing its stablecoin are always equal to or greater than the total amount of USDt in circulation. However, the company has faced ongoing scrutiny and controversy regarding the thoroughness and reliability of its audits.

One of the most valuable features of Tether is its liquidity. It allows traders and investors to quickly exchange one cryptocurrency for another without the need to first convert their funds to fiat currencies like the US dollar or euro. What’s more, Tether can be used for global payments by eliminating the need for complex currency conversions.

 **Tether vs. other stablecoins** 

*Tether (USDt), USD Coin (USDC), Dai (DAI) and Binance USD (BUSD) are some of the commonly used stablecoins, where each serves slightly different needs and differs in their priorities.*

Tether had a head start in adoption and remains the most widely used stablecoin globally. However, USDC, DAI and BUSD have been catching up, particularly among institutions, thanks to their focus on transparency and compliance.

While all three alternatives are fiat-backed and maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, USDt and USDC lead in multichain support, offering flexibility on networks like Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. BUSD, in comparison, is limited to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain.

USDC and BUSD stand out for their robust auditing practices and backing by regulated financial institutions. In contrast, Tether has faced criticism for its reserve transparency, leading some users to prefer the assurance of USDC’s monthly reports.

For everyday users, redemption processes also vary. USDC and BUSD offer straightforward options with low minimum withdrawal amounts, making them more accessible. In contrast, Tether requires users to meet higher minimum thresholds and pay additional fees, which may not be ideal for smaller transactions.

 **Key use cases of Tether in crypto trading and beyond** 

*Apart from being a stablecoin, Tether can be viewed as a versatile tool that bridges traditional finance and blockchain technology.*

Here’s how USDt is used in the crypto world:

Hedging against volatility: For many, USDt may act as a haven during market turbulence. Investors often convert volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) into USDt to lock in their value without leaving the crypto ecosystem.

Efficient cross-border transfers: Sending money internationally using USDt can be much faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers. It also eliminates intermediary fees and offers near-instant transactions, making it a suitable option for businesses and individuals alike.

Decentralized finance (DeFi): USDt plays a major role in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling lending, borrowing and yield farming. Users can earn rewards by providing liquidity or staking USDt while benefiting from its stability.

Trading and asset diversification: USDt can simplify trading by acting as a bridge currency. It’s part of many core trading pairs on many exchanges for many cryptocurrencies, allowing users to easily buy, sell or hold assets without worrying about fiat currency conversion delays.

Payments and settlements: Businesses can use USDt for fast and cost-effective payments. Whether settling invoices or conducting cross-border e-commerce, USDt could offer efficiency while avoiding currency fluctuations.

 **How to buy, store and use Tether (USDt) safely** 

*Although ​​Tether is one of the most well-known stablecoins in the crypto world, like anything involving your money, handling it with care is important.*

Let’s break down how you can buy, store and use USDt safely without running into trouble.

**How to buy Tether (USDt)**

The easiest way to buy Tether is through a crypto exchange. On cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Binance, Coinbase or Kraken, you can trade fiat currencies like the USD or euros for USDt. Generally, you’ll need to sign up, verify your identity, and then fund your wallet with a bank transfer, credit card or even another cryptocurrency. Those funds can be used then to directly trade for USDt.

For those who prefer decentralized options, you can use a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. However, DEXs require you to already own some cryptocurrency for trading and gas (transfer) fees, so they might not be ideal for beginners.

**Storing USDt**

Once you have purchased USDt, you’ll want a safe place to store it. Although most exchanges offer internal wallets directly in your account, it’s safer to move your USDt into a personal wallet where you’re in full control. Moving your money away from a crypto exchange wallet is safer, as personal wallets can provide full control over the private keys, reducing the risk of losing funds to exchange hacks or freezes.

There are two major types of wallets:

* **Hot wallets:** Hot wallets, like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, offer easy access and convenience for frequent transactions. However, their constant internet connection makes them more susceptible to hacking attempts.
* **Cold wallets:** These are offline wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor hardware wallets. They can be the safest option for long-term storage since they are not connected to the internet and give users full custody of their private keys, ensuring complete control over their assets.

Enabling two-factor authorization (2FA), backing up a wallet’s private keys or recovery phrases and storing them safely can prove secure for long-term holdings.

**Using USDt safely**

To safely use USDt, verify a wallet address before each transaction and do not share your private keys with anybody.

In cases where you connect your wallet to an app or website, make sure they are legitimate and not phishing websites.

***Did you know?** In some cities, such as Milan and Poznan, crypto ATMs allow you to buy or sell USDt using cash. These machines work similarly to traditional ATMs but are connected to a crypto network instead of a bank.*

 **Risks and controversies surrounding Tether (USDt)** 

*Although the cryptocurrency ecosystem is highly dependent on Tether, several debates and investigations have questioned its stability and transparency.*

**Questions about reserve backing**

A primary concern surrounding Tether is whether each USDt is indeed backed 1:1 by US dollars or equivalent assets. According to the New York Attorney General, investigations have shown that Tether’s reserves are not always fully backed by cash but include a combination of cash equivalents, loans and investments connected with its sister company, Bitfinex.

While Tether has begun to disclose that its reserves include US Treasurys, Bitcoin and other assets, the lack of a full, independent audit has kept many skeptical. Critics say it’s hard to gauge the true stability of USDt without comprehensive transparency.

**Concerns about market manipulation**

Tether’s reserve structure also includes Bitcoin, creating a dependency between USDt and Bitcoin’s price. This, in turn, has led some to wonder if new issuances of USDt could artificially inflate Bitcoin prices, forming a feedback loop. Critics compare this to a Ponzi scheme where Tether is reliant on high Bitcoin prices rather than sound dollar backing. In the case of a bear market, for instance, a falling Bitcoin price will seriously weaken Tether’s backing and heighten insolvency risks.

**Transparency issues**

Tether has faced criticism for its lack of regular, independent audits, leading to doubts about its claims of full backing. Although it publishes reserve attestations, these reports often don’t meet financial auditing standards. While firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald have verified the assets held by Tether, the crypto community remains divided on whether such attestations are fair.

 **The future of Tether (USDt)** 

*Tether’s future hinges on its ability to navigate evolving regulations both in Europe and globally; providing full compliance with MiCA and similar frameworks will be essential to securing its position in the stablecoin market.*

**Challenges in Europe**

The new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations create a complex path for Tether’s USDt in Europe. Since Dec. 30, 2024, MiCA has been in full swing, and its provisions raise uncertainty over USDt compliance. While introducing such regulatory requirements has already spurred some exchanges like Coinbase and Crypto.com to delist USDt, others like Binance have adopted a “wait-and-see” attitude as of Jan. 31.

**Implications in the US**

The United States is showing characteristics of a crypto renaissance with Trump’s pro-crypto stance. But initiatives like the Payment Stablecoin Act push for increased transparency, full reserve backing and periodic audits will instill more confidence in the stablecoin market. However, it could be challenging for issuers like Tether if the stricter rules extend to offshore companies.

**Outlook on Tether**

If Tether were to struggle, the consequences for the crypto market could be severe. USDt is one of the major sources of liquidity and a key bridge between traditional and digital assets. A loss of confidence in Tether could thus trigger sell-offs, price falls and liquidity crunches on exchanges, destabilizing the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.
