Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 10, 2025) - Canada's premier Bitcoin-backed strategy LQWD Technologies Corp. (OTCQX: LQWDF) ("LQWD" or the "Company"), a leading provider of enterprise-grade transaction infrastructure and liquidity-on-demand for the Lightning Network announces that development efforts are focused on integration of stablecoin capabilities into the Company's Lightning Network infrastructure. This development is targeted to be completed by month end or shortly thereafter.

A transformative catalyst for LQWD and the Lightning Network, Tether, the world's largest stablecoin serving over 350 million users globally, recently announced bringing US dollar-denominated stablecoin ($USD₮) on the Lightning Network. Furthermore, David Sacks, the Whitehouse's newly named crypto czar said that laying out a "clear regulatory framework" for stablecoins is his first order of business. He believes stablecoins could ensure US dollar dominance globally, increase the use of US dollars as the global reserve currency, and create trillions of dollars in demand for US treasuries. Additionally, Stablecoin issuers are already collectively a top 20 holder of US treasuries. With this trend accelerating, stablecoin issuers are poised to become a top 10 holder of treasuries in the future.

"This is a game-changer for rapid Lightning adoption," said Shone Anstey, CEO of LQWD Technologies. "Tether on Lightning not only enhances the network's utility but has the potential to onboard hundreds of millions of users and facilitate trillions of transactions."

As an example, in 2024, Tether, processed over $10 trillion USD in transactions, approaching Visa's annual volume of $16 trillion USD. The integration of USD₮ with the Lightning Network is expected to drive significant transaction growth as users benefit from Tether's stability combined with Lightning's speed and low fees.

"This milestone marks a major leap forward for scalability, cost-efficiency, and the mass adoption of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network." Mr. Anstey further commented. "Stablecoins play a critical role in digital transactions, and this move strengthens Bitcoin's case as a viable medium of exchange-perfectly aligning with our vision of making internet-powered payments faster, lower cost, and more accessible worldwide."

LQWD's development team has been expanding the Company's Lightning infrastructure to efficiently handle USD₮ stablecoin payments, ensuring seamless, instant, and low-cost transactions for users globally. This strategic expansion strengthens LQWD's position as a key player in the growing Lightning ecosystem, capitalizing on the rising demand for stablecoin transactions.
