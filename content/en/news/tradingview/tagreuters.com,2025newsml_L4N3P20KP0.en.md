Chicago corn and soybeans futures gained on Wednesday, recouping some overnight losses after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projected end-of-season supplies above market expectations.

Wheat futures also edged higher as traders shifted focus to unfavourable weather conditions in Europe and the Black Sea region.
