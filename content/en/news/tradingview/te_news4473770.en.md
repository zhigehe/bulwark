The Ibovespa climbed 0.8% above 125,652 on Monday, driven by broad-based gains, particularly mega-cap commodity producers.

State-owned oil giant Petrobras and iron ore miner Vale added 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, supported by higher oil and iron ore prices.

Other top-performing equities, including heavyweights Ambev, JBS, Eletrobras, Rede D'Or, and B3, rose between 1.1% and 1.9%.

On the economic front, the Central Bank’s latest Focus Bulletin showed inflation expectations rising for the 17th consecutive week to 5.58% for year-end, well above the bank’s upper target.

Investors now await tomorrow's inflation data while assessing global trade uncertainties.
