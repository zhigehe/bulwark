\*\* Sleep apnea device maker Inspire Medical Systems' shares fall 2.9% to $175.72 in morning trade

\*\* Co late on Monday reported Q4 adj EPS of $1.15, above Wall Street est of 73 cents - data compiled by LSEG

\*\* INSP said they have "made steady progress" toward the full launch of sleep apnea device Inspire V during Q4

\*\* Wells Fargo says the launch is slower than expected due to hurdles at its U.S and Mexico manufacturing plants

\*\* Scaling up production on a new U.S. line takes time, as management aims to minimize disruption to production of the older device Inspire IV while producing Inspire V, brokerage says

\*\* Brokerage says a civil investigation by the U.S. justice department related to allegations of false information about co's devices submitted to the agency might hurt the stock

\*\* Brokerages Truist, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo cut their PTs on INSP

\*\* Stock was down 1.3% in 2024
