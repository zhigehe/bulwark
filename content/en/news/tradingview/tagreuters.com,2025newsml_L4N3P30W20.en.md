Biogen forecast 2025 profit below last year's levels and Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, hurt by a strong dollar and fierce competition for its drugs to treat multiple sclerosis.

Its shares fell 3.7% in premarket trading after losing more than 40% of their value last year. The company had a market capitalization of about $20 billion as of its last closing price.

Investors fled the company's stock in 2024 as a slow US launch of Leqembi, the Alzheimer's disease drug it sells with Japan's Eisai , exacerbated worries of declining sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs.

The company in 2022 hired as its top boss former Sanofi CEO Christopher Viehbacher, who launched a $1 billion cost-savings plan and entered deals such as its $6.5 billion acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals in 2023.

Biogen expects 2025 revenue to decline by a mid-single digit percentage, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, from 2024 levels.

"Our financial discipline has enabled a restructuring of our operating expenses with a reallocation of resources toward potential future growth drivers," CEO Viehbacher said.

On an adjusted basis, Biogen expects 2025 profit between $15.25 and $16.25 per share. It earned $16.47 in 2024 and analysts had forecast 2025 profit of $16.34 per share.

The company, however, beat profit expectations for the fourth quarter, benefiting from a better-than-expected demand for its spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza.

Excluding certain items, Biogen earned $3.44 per share in the fourth quarter ended December 31, compared with estimates of $3.35.

Total revenue rose about 3% to $2.46 billion. Analysts had expected fourth-quarter sales of $2.41 billion. Overall sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs, which includes treatments such as Tecfidera and Tysabri, fell 8% to $1.07 billion.
