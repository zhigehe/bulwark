WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday signed a memo on reciprocal trade, directing federal agencies to study how to adjust U.S. tariff rates to match the duties and certain economic barriers enforced by other nations.

The order stops short of actually imposing the tariffs immediately, as many foreign capitals feared, and instead directs the Commerce Department and U.S. trade representative to deliver reports on the steps to be taken to achieve reciprocal trading status.
