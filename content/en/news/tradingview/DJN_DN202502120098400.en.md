The board of World Acceptance has authorized a $25 million share-repurchase program.

The small-loan consumer-finance company said Wednesday that the authorization includes any amount that remains left available under previous buyback programs.

The timing of buybacks will depend on price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available funds and other conditions. The program can be suspended at any time.
