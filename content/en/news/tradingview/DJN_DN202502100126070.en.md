Wilmar International's 4Q earnings are projected to recover sequentially, UOB Kay Hian analysts write in a note. The agribusiness company's 4Q core net profit could range between US$330 million and US$340 million, up from 3Q's US$208 million, they say. The plantation and sugar milling segment is expected to see an on-quarter recovery, mainly due to palm oil plantations, they say. Profit margin from palm upstream likely improved, amid higher palm kernel prices and declining fertilizer costs, they add. UOB Kay Hian maintains a hold rating, while raising its target price to S$3.18 from S$3.00. Shares are 0.6% higher at S$3.26.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)
