MSA Safety Incorporated, a global leader in safety equipment and solutions, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31,Â 2024. The company reported steady performance amidst a dynamic operating environment, highlighting key financial metrics and strategic initiatives.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, MSA Safety achieved net sales of $500 million, marking a 1% increase on a GAAP basis and a 2% organic increase year-over-year. The company reported a GAAP operating income of $118 million, representing 23.5% of sales, and an adjusted operating income of $120 million, or 24.0% of sales. GAAP net income for the quarter was $88 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, with adjusted earnings of $89 million, or $2.25 per diluted share.

For the full year 2024, net sales reached $1.8 billion, reflecting a 1% GAAP increase and a 2% organic increase year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $389 million, or 21.5% of sales, while adjusted operating income was $414 million, or 22.9% of sales. The company recorded GAAP earnings of $285 million, or $7.21 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings of $305 million, or $7.70 per diluted share.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

MSA Safety's performance was bolstered by effective SG&A management, despite facing challenges such as industrial end market weakness, softer U.S. fire service demand, and foreign exchange headwinds. The company invested $14 million in capital expenditures, repaid $43 million of debt, returned $20 million to shareholders through dividends, and repurchased $10 million of common stock in the fourth quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $54 million, with $94 million of debt repaid, $79 million returned to shareholders via dividends, and $30 million in share repurchases.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

MSA Safety continued to strengthen its financial position, ending the year with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x and ample liquidity. The company balanced capital allocation priorities by returning $79 million to shareholders through dividends, executing $30 million in share repurchases, and repaying $94 million in debt. The company's healthy balance sheet and strong financial profile provide flexibility for executing strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions.

**Management's Perspective**

Steve Blanco, MSA Safety President and CEO, commented on the company's resilient performance, highlighting double-digit EPS growth and solid operating margin expansion. He noted the challenges faced in 2024, including industrial end market weakness and foreign exchange headwinds, but expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the dynamic operating environment and achieve its 2028 targets through the Accelerate corporate strategy.

Lee McChesney, Senior Vice President and CFO, emphasized the company's strong operational execution, margin enhancement, and double-digit EPS growth. He acknowledged the volatility of the fourth quarter and full year but expressed cautious optimism for 2025, given the generally healthy operating conditions, solid order pace, and capital deployment flexibility.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, MSA Safety expects low-single digit full-year organic sales growth. The company anticipates diverse end market demand, growing global demand for safety products, stable funding for fire services, and supportive market dynamics in detection and connected worker technology. However, challenges such as the non-recurrence of a U.S. Air Force order, mixed industrial end market demand, and macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are expected to persist.
