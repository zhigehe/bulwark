Tech stocks were mixed Wednesday afternoon, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) decreasing 0.4% and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) adding 0.1%.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index shed 0.2%.

In corporate news, Confluent shares jumped past 23% after several analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the company's forecast-beating Q4 results.

OneStream shares sank more than 20% after JPMorgan downgraded the company's stock to neutral from overweight and cut its price target to $26 from $30, likely driven by the company's downbeat Q1 guidance.

Radware shares rose 3% after it reported higher Q4 adjusted earnings and revenue.
