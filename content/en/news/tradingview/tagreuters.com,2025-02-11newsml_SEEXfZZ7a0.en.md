TIRANA (Albania), February 11 (SeeNews) - The net profit of Albanian banks rose to 37.4 billion leks ($385.1 million/373.2 million euro) in 2024, from 32.5 billion leks in the previous year, the Albanian Association of Banks (AAB) said on Tuesday.

The outstanding loan portfolio of banks in the country totalled 834.2 billion leks at the end of 2024, an increase from 739.5 billion leks a year earlier, AAB said in a monthly report, quoting Albanian central bank data.

Deposits in Albanian banks increased to 1.68 trillion leks as at the end of 2024, from 1.61 trillion leks a year earlier.

The total assets of the country's banking system grew 6.4% on the year to 2.09 trillion leks in 2024.

The figures comprise the financial results of eleven Albanian banks. Banka Kombetare Tregtare (BKT) was the largest among them in terms of assets at the end of the third quarter.
