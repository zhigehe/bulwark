AlphaValue/Baader Europe sees Carrefour's move to fully acquire its Brazilian unit Atacad達o as a strategic step to improve the French supermarket operator's valuation but remains cautious about any significant re-rating.

While Atacad達o's stock has recently seen a modest rise, analysts highlighted that the company's valuation remains weak, with shares down roughly 70% over the past 22 months. Carrefour Brasil has shown a gradual recovery, benefiting from same-store sales growth and restructuring efforts, but improving big-box store performance remains key to further improving profitability.

"[The] acquisition of the remaining stake in Brazil might not be enough to nudge the group's valuation beyond a certain extent. The company will need to address the domestic pain-points (especially the performance of big box stores) to catalyze any upward re-rating," analysts said.

The research firm rates Carrefour at buy, with a target price of 22.5 euros.
