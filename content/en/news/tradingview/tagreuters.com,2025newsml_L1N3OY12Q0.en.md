Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures closed lower on Friday under pressure from improved weather in dry growing areas of Argentina, analysts said.

* Rainfall this week provided much-needed relief over 60% of Argentina's current planted soybean crop, the Rosario grains exchange said.
* Rains will increase in central Argentina starting late next week, weather forecaster Maxar said, adding that this week's rain boosted soil moisture in a fairly narrow area.
* The [United States](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/) faces competition for global sales from Argentina, the No. 1 exporter of soymeal and soyoil, and [Brazil](https://www.reuters.com/world/brazil/), the world's biggest soybean supplier.
* Brazilian farmers are expected to produce 174.88 million metric tons of soy for 2024-25, consultancy Safras & Mercado said, raising its estimate from 173.71 million.
* Traders also monitored the risk for U.S. trade tariff disputes and awaited a monthly U.S. Department of Agriculture supply/demand report due next week.
* CBOT March soybeans (SH25) closed 11 cents lower at $10.49-1/2 a bushel.
* CBOT March soymeal (SMH25) finished down $5 at $301.40 per short ton, while March soyoil (BOH25) rose 0.58 cents to end at 45.98 cents per pound.
