Comstock said Thursday its Comstock Fuels unit has entered into a definitive master licensing agreement with Pakistan-based Gresham's Eastern.

Financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.

The deal allows Gresham's, a sustainable energy engineering, equipment and construction company, to use Comstock Fuels' proprietary Bioleum refining technologies in Pakistan to develop and operate its own facilities.

Gresham's will also have exclusive marketing rights for projects based on those technologies, Comstock said.

Comstock shares were edging 0.5% higher in recent Thursday trading.
