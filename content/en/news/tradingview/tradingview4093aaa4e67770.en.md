Roivant, a biopharmaceutical company, has released its financial results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024. The company also provided a comprehensive business update, highlighting significant developments and future plans.

**Financial Highlights**

Roivant reported consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of approximately $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. The company noted a significant increase in research and development (R&D) expenses, which rose by $33.4 million to $141.6 million compared to the same period in the previous year. This increase was primarily driven by program-specific costs and personnel-related expenses.

General and administrative (G&A) expenses also saw an increase, rising by $13.4 million to $141.5 million. This was largely due to an increase in share-based compensation expense. Roivant reported a net income of $118.1 million for the quarter, a significant decrease from the $5.1 billion reported in the same period last year, which included a substantial gain from the sale of Telavant net assets.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Roivant has made notable progress in its clinical pipeline. The company announced the development of brepocitinib for cutaneous sarcoidosis, an orphan indication with high unmet need. Additionally, the development of IMVT-1402 is rapidly progressing, with six Investigational New Drug (IND) applications cleared and pivotal studies in Graves’ disease and difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis initiated.

Topline results from the pivotal trial of batoclimab in myasthenia gravis and initial results from the trial in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are expected by March 31, 2025. The company also reported progress in ongoing litigation, with significant developments expected in the Moderna case throughout 2025.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In January 2025, Immunovant, a subsidiary of Roivant, announced a $450 million private placement, increasing Roivant’s ownership to approximately 57%. The company also highlighted the initiation of potentially registrational trials for IMVT-1402 in Graves’ disease and difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis.

Roivant reported a one-time regulatory milestone of $75 million received in January for the approval of VTAMA in atopic dermatitis and $113 million of external capital raised in Immunovant’s January private placement. However, the company also announced the discontinuation of further development of namilumab for the treatment of sarcoidosis following a failed Phase 2 study.

**Management's Perspective**

Matt Gline, CEO of Roivant, expressed optimism about the company's expanded clinical pipeline and the potential of brepocitinib in cutaneous sarcoidosis. He emphasized the significance of the upcoming study outcomes for batoclimab and brepocitinib, stating that 2025 is expected to be a pivotal year for Roivant.

**Future Outlook**

Roivant provided guidance for several upcoming milestones. The company anticipates initiating clinical trials evaluating IMVT-1402 in a total of ten indications by March 31, 2026. Topline results from the pivotal trial of batoclimab in myasthenia gravis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are expected by March 31, 2025. Additionally, the company plans to report topline data from ongoing trials of brepocitinib and mosliciguat in the second half of 2025 and 2026, respectively.
