MDA Space (TSX: MDA) on Monday signed a $1.1 billion contract with Globalstar to be the prime contractor for the U.S.-listed satellite operator's next-generation low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation.

As part of the contract, MDA Space will manufacture more than 50 MDA AURORA software-defined digital satellites for Globalstar.

The contract is a follow-on to an initial Authorization to Proceed contract with an undisclosed customer in November 2023.

A contract value of about $750 million will be added to the company's backlog in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This is in addition to the ATP value of about $350 million previously added to the backlog.
