TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Clairvest Group Inc. today reported results for the fiscal 2025 third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2024. (All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Highlights**

* December 31, 2024 book value was $1,234.3 million or $86.78 per share compared with $1,196.9 million or $84.06 per share as at September 30, 2024
* Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was $38.5 million or $2.70 per share
* Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2024 was $101.3 million of $7.00 per share
* Clairvest and Clairvest Equity Partners VII (“CEP VII”) invested in Redstone Food Group
* Clairvest and Clairvest Equity Partners III (“CEP III”) sold its investment in Chilean Gaming Holdings

Clairvest’s book value was $1,234.3 million or $86.78 per share as at December 31, 2024, compared with $1,196.9 million or $84.06 per share as at September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, Clairvest recorded net income of $38.5 million, or $2.70 per share, which was driven by the realization of its investment in Chilean Gaming Holdings, a net increase in the valuation of Clairvest’s private equity investment portfolio and net foreign exchange gains due to material weakness in the Canadian dollar as the Company has various assets in foreign currencies which are not hedged against the Canadian dollar.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, the net income was $101.3 million, or $7.00 per share.

In November 2024, and as previously announced, Clairvest together with CEP VII made a $42.1 million minority preferred equity investment in Redstone Food Group, a leading commercial bakery of bread and bakery products, focused on the in-store bakery segment. Clairvest’s portion of the investment was $10.5 million. Redstone Food Group is the first investment of CEP VII’s US$1.2 billion investment program, which commenced on April 1, 2024.

In November 2024, Chilean Gaming Holdings, an acquisition entity for Clairvest, CEP III and other co-investors, sold its ownership interests in various casino properties in Chile. Proceeds on the sale totalled $41 million for Clairvest, compared with a cost of $28 million. There may be additional cash proceeds on this realization which are subject to certain conditions and are not expected to be material. Clairvest made its initial investment in Chilean Gaming Holdings in January 2008, and its realization represents the sale of the last investment of CEP III.

“This past quarter was a productive one for Clairvest, highlighted by a new investment and a portfolio realization. We are pleased to partner with Rob Wheeler, an entrepreneur who shares our vision for growth, and we look forward to supporting Redstone Food Group in its next chapter. Additionally, we completed the sale of a legacy portfolio company, enabling our team to focus on value creation within our existing investments and on the strategic deployment of capital in CEP VII. This sale also concluded the CEP III investment program which generated a net return of 2.5x and a 17% IRR for our third-party investors, making this another top quartile fund for Clairvest,” said Ken Rotman, CEO of Clairvest.
