Action Against Hunger is Doing Everything it Can to Continue Our Life-Saving Work

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / February 10,Â 2025 / On January 20th, the new U.S. administration ordered an immediate freeze on U.S. international aid. While it may not have been the intention, the announcement has resulted in confusion and may put lives at risk.

Since approximately 30% of Action Against Hunger's global programs rely on U.S. government support, we are preparing for potential impacts. Uninterrupted funding is essential for us to deliver efficient, well-run programs and continuity of care for malnourished children, pregnant women, and families living in war zones, among others.

"We have extremely malnourished children who cannot have the treatment that they need. If the funding uncertainty continues, then many of these people will actually die," said Dr. Charles E. Owubah, CEO of Action Against Hunger.

Any decrease in U.S. funding could cost lives, while taking a stand against global hunger has bipartisan support from most Americans across every region, income and education level, gender, race, and marital status. They may know that it is in America's best interest to fund impactful and independent nonprofit hunger programs, helping to create a more secure and prosperous world.
