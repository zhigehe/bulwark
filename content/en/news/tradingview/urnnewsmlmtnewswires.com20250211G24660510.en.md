Black Sesame International Holding said electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is one of the manufacturers it is in partnership with, which is a response to unusual movements in its shares, according to a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing on Monday.

However, Black Sesame did not mention any connection to BYD's new automated driving system.

There was speculation that the Chinese chipmaker would be providing chips to BYD's self-driving cars, which will be embedded with the God's Eye self-driving system, according to a same-dated report on Yicai Global.

Black Sesame previously said on Feb. 7 that BYD is using its chips, Yicai said.

Black Sesame's shares rose more than 1% in recent trade.
