Hanwha Aerospace completed acceptance tests for its 1,000-horsepower diesel engine for the K9 self-propelled howitzer, the aerospace company said Wednesday.

The year-long trials, carried out in South Korea, Egypt, and other regions, covered over 10,000 km in diverse environments, including deserts.

Hanwha plans to equip Egypt's K9A1EGY units with the new engine, with deliveries set for the first quarter of 2026, the release said.

K9 is touted as a popular artillery system adopted by countries, including six NATO members. It can deliver consistent, accurate, rapid effects at ranges of over 40km with high rates and volumes of fire.

Shares of Hanwha Aerospace rose more than 2% at market close on Friday.
