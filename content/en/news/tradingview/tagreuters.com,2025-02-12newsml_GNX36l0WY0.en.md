LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Barfresh Food Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Barfresh”) , a provider of frozen, ready-to-blend and ready-to-drink beverages, today announced multiple new customer wins in the education channel in the Southern United States. The Company plans to expand its school service footprint by more than 800 new schools in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, serving a total student population of approximately 560,000 students. Some of these schools have already integrated Barfresh’s smoothie products into their breakfast menus, with complete implementation expected across all locations through the start of the 2025-26 academic year. Additionally, several of these new schools are planning to add the Company’s new Pop & Go™ 100% Juice Freeze Pops to their lunch menus for the 2025-26 school year.

Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “These new customer wins in the Southern United States, following our recent expansions in other regions, demonstrate the strong momentum our sales network has built. With our expanding production capacity and broader product portfolio, including our Twist & Go™ smoothies and new Pop & Go™ 100% Juice Freeze Pops, we’re well-positioned to meet the growing demand in the K-12 segment. Student participation rates consistently increase when our smoothies are added to breakfast menus, validating both the appeal of our products and their alignment with school nutrition requirements. The Southern United States, with its year-round warm climate, presents unique opportunities for our frozen beverage offerings, particularly as we prepare to introduce our Pop & Go™ product line to the lunch period, where we typically see significantly higher volume compared to breakfast service.”
