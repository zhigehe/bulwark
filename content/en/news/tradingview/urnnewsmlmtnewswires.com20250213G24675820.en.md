Investors shrugged off Britain's better-than-expected gross domestic product data to focus on mixed corporate earnings, sending the blue-chip FTSE 100 index down 0.49% on Thursday's close.

The UK economy expanded 0.1% quarterly in the final three months of 2024, beating expectations of a 0.1% fall after flatlining in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, the monthly GDP was up 0.4% in December 2024, against the previous and projected rate of 0.1%.

"The UK economy grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024, though only because of a surge in inventories. These are a notoriously volatile accounting fixture which, unlike other parts of the GDP breakdown, don't tell us much about the underlying health of the economy," ING said. "It's not all bad. December's monthly figures were better, helped by certain consumer-facing services."

The market came under pressure as consumer goods giants British American Tobacco and Unilever and lender Barclays slumped 8.81%, 5.64%, and 4.71%, respectively, after their earnings releases. While the tobacco products maker delivered 2024 results in line with its guidance, it warned about the impact of significant regulatory and fiscal headwinds in Bangladesh and Australia in 2025.

RBC Capital Markets took a negative stance on Unilever's full-year report, which showed that the company sees a slower start to 2025 with subdued near-term market growth. "While we think the outlook is in line with consensus for 2025, we would not be surprised to see Q1/Q2 consensus coming down," according to the research firm.

Meanwhile, Barclays reported strong 2024 earnings and a share buyback.
