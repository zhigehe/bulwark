NH3 Clean Energy joined forces with the Pilbara Ports Authority in Western Australia to explore options for the loading and export of ammonia from its WAH2 low-emissions ammonia project, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

It signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding outlining cooperation over 12 months to establish operational arrangements and binding agreements supporting clean ammonia export, the filing said.

The phase one production of 600,000 tonnes per annum of clean ammonia will be shipped via the port of Dampier Bulk Liquids Berth, and transported to the port via a pipeline located in the existing infrastructure corridor, per the filing.

The ammonia is expected to be used as fuel for bulk carriers used to export iron ore from the Pilbara region.
