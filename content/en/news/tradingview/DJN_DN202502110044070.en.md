SGS's 2027 strategy implementation is showing promising results, Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth says in a research note. The Swiss testing, inspection and certification company's strategy 2027 execution led to solid profitability improvement and strong free cash flow generation, the analyst says. This allowed for balance sheet deleveraging and an increased option for investors to receive more shares instead of a cash dividend, he says. Shares trade 6.5% higher at 97.08 Swiss francs.
