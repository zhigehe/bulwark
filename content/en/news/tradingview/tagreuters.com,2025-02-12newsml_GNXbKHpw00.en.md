New York, NY, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — FrankSpeech Network, Inc (“FSBN”),OTC: PINK which is currently being rebranded as Mike Lindell Media Corp., today announced the addition of Rudy Giuliani to the Board of Directors.

FrankSpeech Network, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, is referred to herein as “us”, “we”, “our” or

the “Company”.

**Appointment of Rudolph “Rudy” Giuliani**

On February 7, 2025, Rudolph “Rudy” Giuliani, age 80, was appointed as a member of the

Company’s Board of Directors to serve for the earlier of a term of one year or until his death, resignation

or removal.

From February 1981 to June 1983, Rudy Giuliani served as the associate attorney general for the

Reagan administration, the third-highest position in the Department of Justice. From June 1983 to

January 1989, Rudy Giuliani was appointed by Ronald Reagan as the United States Attorney for the

Southern District of New York, where he spearheaded successful efforts against organized crime, white-

collar criminals, drug dealers and corrupt elected officials.

In 1993, Rudy Giuliani was elected as the Mayor of the city of New York, serving from January 1994 to December 2001, during which time he

focused on reducing crime, reforming welfare, and improving the quality of life.

On September 11, 2001, America suffered the worst attack in its history when terrorists crashed planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Thousands of New Yorkers were killed, including hundreds of members of the city's uniformed services, who rushed to the scene to lead the heroic rescue of tens of thousands of people. Having narrowly missed being crushed when the Towers fell, Mayor Giuliani immediately began leading the recovery of the city as it faced its darkest hour. Mayor Giuliani was widely lauded for his steady hand during challenging times.

Since leaving office as Mayor, Rudy Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for

political offices at all levels. In mid-April 2018, Rudy Giuliani joined Donald Trump's legal team, which

dealt with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S.

elections.

In November 2020, Donald Trump placed Rudy Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged

voter irregularities in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In 1965, Rudy Giuliani graduated from Manhattan College with a Bachelor’s degree in political

science. In 1968, Rudy Giuliani graduated cum laude from New York School of Law in Manhattan with a

Juris Doctor degree.
