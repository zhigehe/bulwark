US gasoline futures fell to $2.12 per gallon, following lower oil prices as rising crude stockpiles and strong inflation data dampened hopes for rate cuts.

The latest EIA data showed crude inventories increased by 4.1 million barrels, surpassing forecasts, while gasoline stocks unexpectedly fell by 3 million barrels.

Also, hotter-than-expected inflation raised doubts about the Fedâ€™s ability to lower rates soon, with Jerome Powell signaling no urgency for cuts.

On top of that, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude output estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.55 bdp.
