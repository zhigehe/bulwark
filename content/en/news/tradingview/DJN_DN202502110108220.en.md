Live cattle trading on the CME finish lower after the USDA said in its latest WASDE report that the slaughter rate for beef cows is expected to increase in 2025. This comes as other reports show that the supply of cattle in the U.S. is not quite as low as previously believed by the livestock industry, allowing the USDA to raise its beef production outlook by 775 million pounds in2025. Cattle finish down 1% to $1.967 a pound. Lean hogs settle up 1.3% to 92.3 cents a pound, this despite the USDA saying in today's WASDE that higher pig weights are more than offsetting a slower pace of slaughter in the first quarter of 2025.
