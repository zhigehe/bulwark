Disney is scrapping a diversity and inclusion performance metric that factored into its executive compensation and adding a new "talent strategy" category, according to a staff memo seen by The Wall Street Journal.

The new performance metric will assess how leaders "uphold our company values" and "incorporate different perspectives to drive business success," Sonia Coleman, Disney's chief human resources officer, said in the memo.

President Trump is cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion practices inside the federal government. Many private corporations including Alphabet's Google and Target are rethinking - and in some cases eliminating - DEI-focused programs and goals.

Disney is replacing language online related to its "Reimagine Tomorrow" initiative, which prioritized accurate and diverse representation from diverse and underrepresented communities, with an updated set of business goals.

The entertainment company is also softening content warnings before older movies such on its Disney+ streaming service such as "Peter Pan" and "The Aristocats."

Disney's Coleman said in her memo that its latest moves are part of an "evolution of our strategic framework for advancing our commitment to being welcoming, respectful, and inclusive in how we operate so we are the best place to work."
