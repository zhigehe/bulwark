$4.0 million upfront with up to an additional $6.0 million of gross proceeds upon the exercise in full for cash of warrants

TAREN POINT, Australia, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Fitell Corporation (“Fitell” or the “Company”), an online retailer of gym and fitness equipment in Australia, today announced that it has revised certain terms of its previously announced registered direct offering. Pursuant to the revised terms, the Company has agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 796,813 ordinary shares and an additional investment right to purchase up to 1,195,220 ordinary shares in the form of warrants, at a purchase price of $5.02 per ordinary share and associated warrant. The warrants will have an exercise price of $5.02 per share, will be exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire three years following the issaunce date. The offering is still expected to close on or about February 10, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Rodman & Renshaw LLC is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering are expected to be approximately $4.0 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The potential gross proceeds from the warrants, if fully exercised on a cash basis, will be approximately $6.0 million. No assurance can be given that any of the warrants will be exercised. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for the development and commercial launch of smart fitness equipment and for general corporate purposes and working capital. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, or other intellectual property, although the Company has no present commitments or agreements to do so.

The securities described above are being offered and sold by the Company in a registered direct offering pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-284232), including a base prospectus, that was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 10, 2025, and declared effective by the SEC on February 5, 2025. The offering of such securities in the registered direct offering is being made only by means of a prospectus supplement that forms a part of such effective registration statement. The prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus relating to the registered direct offering will be filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC’s website located at www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus may also be obtained, when available, from Rodman & Renshaw LLC at 600 Lexington Avenue, 32nd Floor, New York, NY 10022, by telephone at (212) 540-4414, or by email at info@rodm.com.
