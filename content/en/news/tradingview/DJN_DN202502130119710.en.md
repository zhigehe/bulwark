By Andrea Figueras

Italy's Moncler reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, aided by improving trends in China at a time when some sector rivals point to a potential rebound in demand for luxury goods.

The maker of high-end puffer jackets said Thursday that it made revenue of 1.24 billion euros ($1.29 billion) for the final quarter of 2024, up 8% from the prior-year period. The result surpassed a company-provided consensus of 1.16 billion euros.

For the year as a whole, the company made earnings before interest and taxes of 916.3 million euros, higher than 893.8 million euros it booked in the prior year and ahead of analysts' projections of 878.1 million euros.

Net profit jumped 5% on year to 639.6 million euros.

"As we move into 2025, while the global macroeconomic context remains uncertain, we are confident in our ability to navigate evolving market dynamics," Chairman and Chief Executive Remo Ruffini said.
