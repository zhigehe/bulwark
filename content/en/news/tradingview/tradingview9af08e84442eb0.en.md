Watts Water Technologies, Inc., a global leader in plumbing, heating, and water quality products, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company reported a slight decline in sales but achieved record operating income and earnings per share.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 21% to $2.02, while adjusted diluted EPS rose by 4% to $2.05.

For the full year 2024, the company achieved sales of $2.25 billion, a 10% increase on a reported basis but a 1% decline organically.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

In the fourth quarter, the company completed the acquisition of I-CON Systems, Inc., which is expected to enhance its digital offerings and provide growth opportunities in the correctional facility niche of the institutional market. The integration of I-CON Systems is progressing well.

Regionally, sales in the Americas increased by 3% on a reported basis but declined by 3% organically. In Europe, sales decreased by 15% on both a reported and organic basis, primarily due to fewer shipping days and declines in the OEM channel. In the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (APMEA) region, sales increased by 4% on a reported basis and 3% organically, driven by growth in China and the Middle East.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Watts Water Technologies repurchased approximately 20,000 shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $4 million during the fourth quarter of 2024. For the full year, the company repurchased approximately 85,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $17 million. Approximately $145 million remains available under the stock repurchase program authorized in 2023.

**Management's Perspective**

CEO Robert J. Pagano Jr. commended the Watts team for their dedication throughout 2024, highlighting record results for the quarter and full year. He emphasized the successful completion of the I-CON Systems acquisition and the company's strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, which support strategic investments and capital returns to shareholders.

Pagano also noted the company's proactive measures to adjust its cost structure in response to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and mixed global markets. He expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate current market conditions and capitalize on growth opportunities aligned with favorable secular trends.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, Watts Water Technologies anticipates full-year sales growth to range from a 3% decline to a 2% increase on both a reported and organic basis. The company expects its operating margin to be between 16.7% and 17.3%, with an adjusted operating margin between 17.7% and 18.3%.
