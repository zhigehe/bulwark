Japan Display will end production at its Mobara Fab by March 2026 and convert the site into an AI data center, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Production will be consolidated at its Ishikawa facility, which will be transformed into a "MULTI/FAB" capable of handling G4.5 and G6 substrate displays, sensors, and semiconductor packaging.

The restructuring is part of JDI's "Beyond Display" strategy, aimed at shifting toward high-growth markets like advanced semiconductor packaging and sensors.

The company expects to cut annual fixed costs by about 25 billion yen and may record extraordinary losses and gains related to the transition.
