HKFoods Plc, Financial Statements Bulletin 14 February 2025, at 8.30 am. EET

HKFoods’ Financial Statements Bulletin 1 January–31 December 2024

**October–December 2024**

* HKFoods’ net sales from continuing operations increased by 6.9 per cent to EUR 266.9 (249.7) million. HKFoods increased its sales in all other sales channels except industrial sales, where sales declined as planned. Consumer demand in Finland remained at the comparison period’s level but was particularly focused on lower-priced products. HKFoods was able to meet demand with its comprehensive product portfolio, which increased sales in the retail sector. Sales in the food service channel developed strongly, enabling HKFoods to strengthen its position in the market.
* The Group’s EBIT from continuing operations totalled EUR 6.5 (3.1) million.
* The Group’s comparable EBIT from continuing operations was EUR 10.3 (3.0) million. The improved performance was driven by a better sales mix, production efficiency measures and cost savings. Especially Christmas season sales were successful. Sales to the retail sector increased, especially to the food service channel. In addition, the structure of export sales was strengthened by growth focused on added-value products.
* Cost levels remained high in October–December. In addition to the cost increases in energy and external services, wage costs were pushed up by previously agreed general pay rises. HKFoods was able to cover the impact of the cost increase through production efficiency measures and cost savings. Particularly the investment in the Rauma poultry cutting department increased production efficiency.

* The comparable EBIT of the Business Unit Finland was EUR 14.5 (6.3) million.
* Cash flow from business operations including discontinued operations was EUR 38.4 (33.1) million.
* The company’s extensive restructuring was completed on 31 October 2024 when HKFoods sold its Danish business to Plukon Food Group B.V. from the Netherlands.

**January–December 2024**

* HKFoods’ net sales from continuing operations increased by 7.4 per cent to EUR 1,001.8 (933.0) million.
* Sales increased due to good consumer demand and successful commercial activities. Sales increased especially in the Finnish retail channel in the early part of the review period, with the food service channel showing more pronounced sales growth towards the end of the period. Exports from Finland remained at the previous year’s level; exports of red meat fell while exports of poultry meat and meat products increased significantly.

* The Group’s EBIT from continuing operations totalled EUR 22.4 (14.3) million.

* The Group’s comparable EBIT from continuing operations was EUR 27.7 (11.6) million. An improved sales mix, increased production efficiency and cost savings improved EBIT during the review period.
* HKFoods strengthened its position in the Finnish consumer market, which reduced the need for less profitable meat exports. Growth in exports of meat products also strengthened the structure of export sales.
* Cost levels remained high, with the cost of external services in particular rising from the comparison period. Profitability of red meat, especially beef, continued to be challenging in Finland, but improved towards the end of the review period. Increased production volumes, investments in production and efficiency measures enhanced operational efficiency and improved the company's profitability.
* The comparable EBIT of the Business Unit Finland was EUR 37.7 (20.5) million.
* Cash flow from operating activities including discontinued operations was EUR 60.8 (50.6) million. Cash flow improved because of better working capital development performance and lower financing costs than in the comparison period.
* Interest-bearing net debt was EUR 149.8 (287.9) million and net gearing 69.5 (121.0) per cent.
* Interest-bearing net debt excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities was EUR 62.2 (184.3) million.
* The sale of the Swedish business was completed on 27 March 2024.
* The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that no dividend is to be paid for the financial year 2024. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to distribute EUR 0.09 per share from the company's reserve for invested unrestricted equity for 2024. The Board of Directors further proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the distribution of the funds recorded in the reserve for invested unrestricted equity, at its discretion, up to a maximum of EUR 0.05 per share. Under the authorisation, the Board of Directors could decide to distribute funds in one or more instalments.

The figures in parentheses refer to the same period in the previous year, unless otherwise mentioned. The figures are unaudited.

**HKFoods’ CEO Juha Ruohola**

HKFoods’ continuing operations developed strongly in 2024, with both net sales and comparable EBIT growing significantly. The company’s net sales from continuing operations in 2024 increased by 7.4 per cent to EUR 1,001.8 (933.0) million. In the fourth quarter the comparable EBIT was 3.9 (1.2) per cent of net sales. The comparable EBIT margin for the whole year was 2.8 (2.2) per cent. The company’s EBIT target is 4 per cent.

HKFoods increased its profitability also in the fourth quarter through successful commercial measures, production efficiency measures and cost savings. Retail sales developed positively with a comprehensive product range and successful Christmas season, which improved the sales mix and profitability. Our food service sector has managed to grow its share in a declining market. The structure of export sales has improved due to increased sales of ready-to-use products.

The company's investment capacity has improved. We have focused our investments on strategic and efficiency investments. The investments in the Rauma and Forssa units have been completed, and our investment in the manufacture of ready-to-eat products in our Eura unit is progressing as well as the investment in the ready meal production of our Vantaa unit. With this investment, we will increase our meal preparation capacity and develop new high-quality meals for consumers' various food moments.

Over the past two and a half years, we have been assessing the position of our businesses within the Group in order to increase our financial flexibility. We have improved HKFoods’ profitability and strengthened our balance sheet through the sale of the Baltic business, which was completed in August 2023. The sale of the Swedish business was closed at the end of March 2024. Our major restructuring was completed at the end of October 2024, when the sale of the Danish subsidiary ROSE Poultry A/S to the Dutch Plukon Food Group was closed.

The divestments have strengthened HKFoods’ balance sheet as planned and the proceeds have been used to repay the company's loans. The company’s net debt decreased by EUR 138.1 million to EUR 149.8 (287.9) million from a year ago. Our net gearing ratio has decreased to 69.5 per cent. As a result of this reduction, our net financing costs have fallen by EUR 7.5 million during 2024. In the financing negotiations in summer 2024, we secured financial continuity until early 2027.

According to HKFoods' vision, updated at the end of 2024, we want to be the most valued partner of food moments. This means working together with all our employees to meet the changing needs of consumers and customers by creating sustainable, tasty and nutritious solutions for all meaningful food moments. It is a collaborative effort with customers, consumers, contract farmers and other company partners.

The company’s strategy affects all sustainability topics identified as material to HKFoods; the most important ones in the medium to long term are climate change, consumer health and safety and animal welfare. These will be pursued with even greater determination. During 2025, we will update our responsibility programme to better address the sustainability topics that we have identified as material to our stakeholders. The wellbeing and safety of our employees will remain at the heart of our responsibility programme. Our key target is to be a safe and healthy workplace for our own employees and the partners working in our units. Improving safety at work is something that will continue to require our continued commitment and action together with all our employees. We are running a quality culture project to improve the quality of our operations and products.

Following the completion of our major restructuring, we are now focusing on implementing our long-term strategy by improving the competitiveness of our core business and the profitability of our operations in Finland. Our efficiency programme, launched at the end of 2024, aims to significantly improve our performance. The programme involves improving production efficiency and strengthening commercial measures.

The measures taken in 2024 have taken the company to the right direction. The hard work has paid off and our future is now on firmer ground than it has been for many years. I would like to thank our own people, our customers, our contractors and our other partners. We are well-positioned to move forward inspired by our new vision.
