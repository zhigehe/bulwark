The Fed has "zero reason to cut interest rates right now," writes Paul Stanley, of Granite Bay Wealth Management, in comments about January PPI inflation. The 0.4% print was higher than expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, while decelerating from a 0.5% pace in December--a figure that was revised from 0.2%. The increase follows a hotter-than-expected CPI reading yesterday. "The resurgence of inflation comes at a unique time, as the economy braces for tariffs, which if sustained, could add yet another inflationary pressure," Stanley says. He adds that fixed-income investors may see an opportunity to lock in higher yields at this time. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
