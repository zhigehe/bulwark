Nevada has confirmed the state's first human case of bird flu in a farm worker who was exposed to infected dairy cattle, the Central Nevada Health District said on Monday.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture for the first time last week confirmed a second strain of bird flu in dairy cattle in Nevada, a discovery that ramped up concerns about the U.S. outbreak.
