CAR Group keeps its bull at Citi despite the hit to revenue from delayed price rises at its U.S. business. Analyst Siraj Ahmed tells clients in a note that he expects revenue growth at the Australian vehicle advertiser's Trader Interactive unit to pick up in fiscal 2026. He expects this U.S. growth, combined with strong growth in Brazil and South Korea, to drive roughly 15% Ebitda growth in each of the next two fiscal years. Less positively, he does say there is some risk of higher operating-expense growth over the same period. Citi lifts its target price by 2.4% to A$43.40 and maintains a buy rating. Shares are up 0.2% at A$37.39. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
