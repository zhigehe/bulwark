CT REIT Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2024 Results

Canada NewsWire

TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2025

TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2025 /CNW/ - CT Real Estate Investment Trust ("CT REIT" or "the REIT") today reported its consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.

"CT REIT delivered another strong financial performance in 2024, despite heightened uncertainty and sustained headwinds in the macroeconomic landscape, and we are proud of our accomplishments last year," said Kevin Salsberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of CT REIT. "As we look to the future, we will continue to deliver on our robust development pipeline and know that the strength of our balance sheet provides us with great flexibility to continue to capitalize on new opportunities and surface value for our unitholders."

New Investment Activity

CT REIT announced three new investments which will require an estimated $59 million to complete. The investments are, in aggregate, expected to earn a going-in yield of 8.11% and represent approximately 284,000 square feet of incremental gross leasable area ("GLA").

The table below summarizes the new investments and their anticipated completion dates:

Financial Highlights

Net Income — Net income was $135.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $97.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in the fair value adjustment on investment properties and higher revenues from the Property portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Net Operating Income (NOI)\* — Total property revenue for the quarter was $145.4 million, which was $5.5 million or 3.9% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, NOI was $115.6 million, which was $4.0 million or 3.6% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to the acquisition, intensification and development of income-producing properties completed in 2023 and 2024, which added $2.7 million, rent escalations from Canadian Tire leases, which contributed $1.4 million and an increase in property operating recoveries, which added $0.4 million.

Same store NOI was $112.1 million and same property NOI was $113.2 million for the quarter, which were $1.6 million or 1.5%, and $2.3 million or 2.0%, respectively, higher when compared to the prior year. Same store NOI increased primarily due to the increased revenue derived from contractual rent escalations and higher property operating recoveries. Same property NOI increased primarily due to the increase in same store NOI noted, as well as from the intensifications completed in 2023 and 2024.

Funds from Operations (FFO)\* — FFO for the quarter was $79.0 million, which was $1.3 million or 1.7% higher than the same period in 2023, primarily due to the impact of NOI variances discussed earlier, partially offset by higher interest expense. FFO per unit - diluted (non-GAAP) for the quarter was $0.334, which was $0.004 or 1.2% higher, compared to the same period in 2023, due to the growth of FFO exceeding the growth in weighted average units outstanding - diluted (non-GAAP).

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\* — AFFO for the quarter was $73.0 million, which was $1.5 million or 2.1% higher than the same period in 2023, primarily due to the impact of NOI variances discussed earlier, partially offset by higher interest expense. AFFO per unit - diluted (non-GAAP) for the quarter was $0.308, which was $0.005 or 1.7% higher, compared to the same period in 2023, due to the growth of AFFO exceeding the growth in weighted average units outstanding - diluted (non-GAAP).

Distributions — Distributions per Unit paid in the quarter amounted to $0.231, which was 3.0% higher than the same period in 2023 due to an increase in the rate of distributions which became effective with the monthly distributions paid in July 2024.

Operating Results

Leasing — CTC is CT REIT's most significant tenant. As at December 31, 2024, CTC represented 92.8% of total GLA and 91.7% of annualized base minimum rent.

Occupancy — As at December 31, 2024, CT REIT's portfolio occupancy rate, on a committed basis, was 99.4%.

\*NOI, FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for additional information.

Specified Financial Measures

CT REIT uses specified financial measures as defined by National Instrument 52-112 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("NI 52-112"). CT REIT believes these specified financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring the financial performance of CT REIT and its ability to meet its principal objective of creating unitholder value over the long term by generating reliable, durable and growing monthly cash distributions on a tax-efficient basis.

These specified financial measures used in this document include non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, within the meaning of NI 52-112. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards, also referred to as generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and therefore they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures and ratios presented by other publicly traded entities and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

See below for further information on specified financial measures used by management in this document and, where applicable, for reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures.

Net Operating Income

NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as property revenue less property expense, adjusted for straight-line rent. The most directly comparable primary financial statement measure is property revenue. Management believes that NOI is a useful key indicator of performance as it represents a measure of property operations over which management has control. NOI is also a key input in determining the fair value of the Property portfolio. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to property revenue or net income and comprehensive income, both of which are determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations

Certain non-GAAP financial measures for the real estate industry have been defined by the Real Property Association of Canada under its publications, "REALPAC Funds From Operations & Adjusted Funds From Operations for IFRS" and "REALPAC Adjusted Cashflow from Operations for IFRS". CT REIT calculates Fund From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Cashflow from Operations in accordance with these publications.

Funds From Operations

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by the real estate industry, particularly by those publicly traded entities that own and operate income-producing properties. The most directly comparable primary financial statement measure is net income and comprehensive income. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The use of FFO, together with the required IFRS Accounting Standards presentations, has been included for the purpose of improving the understanding of the operating results of CT REIT.

Management believes that FFO is a useful measure of operating performance that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact on operations of trends in occupancy levels, rental rates, operating costs and property taxes, acquisition activities and interest costs, and provides a perspective of the financial performance that is not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

FFO adds back to net income items that do not arise from operating activities, such as fair value adjustments. FFO, however, still includes non-cash revenues related to accounting for straight-line rent and makes no deduction for the recurring capital expenditures necessary to sustain the existing earnings stream.

Adjusted Funds From Operations

AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of recurring economic earnings used in the real estate industry to assess an entity's distribution capacity. The most directly comparable primary financial statement measure is net income and comprehensive income. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

CT REIT calculates AFFO by adjusting FFO for non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of straight-line rents. AFFO is also adjusted for a reserve for maintaining the productive capacity required for sustaining property infrastructure and revenue from real estate properties and direct leasing costs. As property capital expenditures do not occur evenly during the fiscal year or from year to year, the capital expenditure reserve in the AFFO calculation, which is used as an input in assessing the REIT's distribution payout ratio, is intended to reflect an average annual spending level. The reserve is primarily based on average expenditures as determined by building condition reports prepared by independent consultants.

Management believes that AFFO is a useful measure of operating performance similar to FFO as described above, adjusted for the impact of non-cash income and expense items.

Capital Expenditure Reserve

following table compares and reconciles recoverable capital expenditures since 2013 to the capital expenditure reserve used in the calculation of AFFO during that period:

The capital expenditure reserve is a non-GAAP financial measure and management believes the reserve is a useful measure to understand the normalized capital expenditures required to maintain property infrastructure. Recoverable capital expenditures are the most directly comparable measure disclosed in the REIT's primary financial statements. The capital expenditure reserve should not be considered as an alternative to recoverable capital expenditures, which is determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

The capital expenditure reserve varies from the capital expenditures incurred due to the seasonal nature of the expenditures. As such, CT REIT views the capital expenditure reserve as a meaningful measure.

FFO per unit - Basic, FFO per unit - Diluted (non-GAAP), AFFO per unit - Basic and AFFO per unit - Diluted (non-GAAP) FFO per unit - basic, FFO per unit - diluted (non-GAAP), AFFO per unit - basic and AFFO per unit - diluted (non-GAAP) are non-GAAP ratios and reflect FFO and AFFO on a weighted average per unit basis. Management believes these non-GAAP ratios are useful measures to investors since the measures indicate the impact of FFO and AFFO, respectively, in relation to an individual per unit investment in the REIT. When calculating diluted per unit amounts, diluted units include restricted and deferred units issued under various plans and exclude the effects of settling the Class C LP Units with Class B LP Units.

Management believes that FFO per unit ratios are useful measures of operating performance that, when compared period-over-period, reflect the impact on operations of trends in occupancy levels, rental rates, operating costs and property taxes, acquisition activities and interest costs, and provides a perspective of the financial performance that is not immediately apparent from net income per unit determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management believes that AFFO per unit ratios are useful measures of operating performance similar to FFO as described above, adjusted for the impact of non-cash income and expense items. The FFO per unit and AFFO per unit ratios are not standardized financial measures under IFRS Accounting Standards and should not be considered as an alternative to other ratios determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The component of the FFO per unit ratios, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is FFO, and the component of AFFO per unit ratios, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is AFFO.

Management calculates the weighted average units outstanding - diluted (non-GAAP) by excluding the full conversion of the Class C LP Units to Class B LP Units, which is not considered a likely scenario. As such, the REIT's fully diluted per unit FFO and AFFO amounts are calculated, excluding the effects of settling the Class C LP Units with Class B LP Units, which management considers a more meaningful measure.

AFFO Payout Ratio

The AFFO payout ratio is a non-GAAP ratio which measures the sustainability of the REIT's distribution payout. Management believes this is a useful measure to investors since this metric provides transparency on performance. Management considers the AFFO payout ratio to be the best measure of the REIT's distribution capacity. The AFFO payout ratio is not a standardized financial measure under IFRS Accounting Standards and should not be considered as an alternative to other ratios determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The component of the AFFO payout ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is AFFO, and the composition of the AFFO payout ratio is as follows:

Same Store NOI

Same store NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which reports the period-over-period performance of the same asset base having consistent GLA in both periods. CT REIT management believes same store NOI is a useful measure to gauge the change in asset productivity and asset value. The most directly comparable primary financial statement measure is property revenue. Same store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to property revenue or net income and comprehensive income, both of which are determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

Same Property NOI

Same property NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is consistent with the definition of same store NOI above, except that same property includes the NOI impact of intensifications. Management believes same property NOI is a useful measure to gauge the change in asset productivity and asset value, as well as measure the additional return earned by incremental capital investments in existing assets. The most directly comparable primary financial statement measure is property revenue. Same property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to property revenue or net income and comprehensive income, both of which are determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

The following table summarizes the same store and same property components of NOI:
