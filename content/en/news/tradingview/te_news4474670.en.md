The yield on France’s 10-year OAT climbed to 3.14%, extending its rebound from a recent seven-week low of 3.055% as investors turned their attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony later on Tuesday and the upcoming US inflation report on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, concerns over a global trade war intensified after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged to take “firm and proportionate” action in response to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain its easing stance, given sluggish economic data from the Eurozone and inflation remaining within projected levels.
