Sterling could take a hit if Britain's monthly gross domestic product number comes in weaker than expected for a fourth consecutive month.

UK GDP for December, due on Thursday at 0700 GMT, is forecast to be up 0.1% on the month.

Another monthly GDP miss would be a boost for doves advocating another Bank of England interest rate cut as early as next month.

At least two Monetary Policy Committee members, Catherine Mann and Swati Dhingra, are expected to vote for a rate reduction on March 20, having wanted the BoE to lower rates by 50 basis points last week.

The consensus expectation is that the BoE will keep rates unchanged in March, before a 25 bps cut to 4.25% in May.

Britain's fourth-quarter GDP print will also be revealed on Thursday; minus 0.1% is forecast, to follow zero growth in the third quarter.

CFTC data on FX positioning showed the net GBP short nearly halved to 11,323 contracts in the week ended Feb. 4.
