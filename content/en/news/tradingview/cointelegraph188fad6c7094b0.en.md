The University of Austin is launching a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin investment fund, showcasing the growing Bitcoin adoption among United States institutions.

The University of Austin will raise a Bitcoin fund worth over $5 million, as part of the institution’s $200 million endowment fund.

“We don’t want to be left behind when their [cryptocurrency’s] potential materializes dramatically,” Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, told FT, according to a Feb. 9 report.

The news of the fund comes over three months after a regulatory filing revealed that Emory University accumulated over $15 million worth of Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 28.

Emory University’s move marked the first US university endowment to report holding Bitcoin ETFs.![Cryptocurrencies, Education, Funding, Bitcoin Price, Investments, Bitcoin Regulation, United States, Universities, Cryptocurrency Investment, Bitcoin Adoption, Bitcoin ETF](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:188fad6c7094b-05d74a901e8585f6f0b0da965b9b1ddc-resized.jpeg)

Continued institutional ETF adoption may significantly bolster Bitcoin’s price since institutions hold large amounts of capital that can move crypto markets. Bitcoin needs continued institutional adoption to reach new all-time highs.

**University of Austin targets 5-year Bitcoin holding strategy**

Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds are targeting multi-year holding strategies.

The University of Austin will aim for a minimum five-year Bitcoin holding strategy, according to Chad Thevenot, senior vice president for advancement at the University of Austin, who said:

“We think there is long-term value there, just the same way that we might think there is long-term value in stocks or real estate.” 

**Crypto adoption may hit retirement funds next**

Beyond just financial institutions, cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction among retirement funds, showcasing a shift in perception among younger generations.

Up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency, according to a Jan. 16 Bitget Research report shared with Cointelegraph.

Moreover, 78% of the respondents expressed greater trust in “alternative retirement savings options” over traditional pension funds, highlighting a major shift towards “decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions.”

The survey’s findings are a “wake-up call for the financial industry,” according to Gracy Chen, the CEO of Bitget, who stated in the report:

“Younger generations are no longer content with one-size-fits-all pension systems. They’re looking for modern solutions that give them more control, flexibility and transparency.”

The report noted that 40% of individuals in these age groups had already invested in cryptocurrency as of January 2025.
