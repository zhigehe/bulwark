Arika Resources said a targeted diamond drilling program is underway at it Yundamindra Gold Project in Western Australia, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The drilling followed the high-grade gold result recently reported from a maiden drilling program including 14 meters at 15.48 grams per tonne of gold from 46 meters, per the filing.

The current drill program will initially focus on three holes of about 500 meters in depth and it followed the completion of a phase two, 5,000-meter expansion program with results expected shortly, the company added.

Company shares rose 3% in recent trade.
