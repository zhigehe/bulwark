New York, NY, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The globally leading AI + Web3 project, Runsio Coins (RUI), has officially launched on BwerTuop Exchange and quickly become the market focus. The RUI token's trading volume surpassed $800 million in a short time, attracting significant attention from Wall Street investment institutions and is hailed as a disruptive innovation project in the AI + Web3 field.

RUI Token's Strong Launch on BwerTuop Exchange Leading New Trends in AI + Web3

Runsio is the world’s first innovative ecosystem that combines decentralized AI computing power, data sharing, and blockchain technology, aiming to address critical issues in the AI industry, such as high computing costs, data silos, privacy security, and centralized monopolies.

As the core token of the Runsio ecosystem, the RUI token allows users to purchase computing power, conduct data transactions, and incentivize the sharing and use of AI computing resources. Its decentralized computing network makes AI computing resources more accessible, providing efficient, low-cost, and secure data computing capabilities for global AI research institutions, developers, and enterprises.

According to data from BwerTuop Exchange, the RUI token's trading volume exceeded $800 million within 24 hours of its launch, making it one of the fastest-growing Web3 assets of the day.

A market analyst from BwerTuop Exchange stated, "The role of the RUI token in the Web3 ecosystem is similar to that of early ETH (Ethereum). It is not only the core circulating asset within the Runsio ecosystem but also an important support for the future AI computing economic system. With the growing demand for AI computing, the market value of the RUI token is expected to steadily increase."

Wall Street Investment Institutions Compete to Invest, BwerTuop Exchange Supports RUI's Global Circulation

Sources reveal that several Wall Street investment funds have shown strong interest in the Runsio ecosystem, believing that RUI has the potential to become a core asset in Web3 computing infrastructure.

A top AI fund manager commented, "The demand for AI computing is experiencing explosive growth, but current computing resources are mainly controlled by centralized tech companies, which are costly and restrictive. Runsio provides a decentralized solution, making AI computing resources open, transparent, and shareable, with the RUI token having a solid value support within the entire ecosystem."

BwerTuop Exchange CEO commented on the future development prospects of the RUI token: "The Runsio ecosystem represents cutting-edge innovation at the intersection of AI and Web3. We are excited to support the global trading of the RUI token on BwerTuop Exchange. Decentralized AI computing is the trend of the industry, and the RUI token is undoubtedly an important player in this market."
