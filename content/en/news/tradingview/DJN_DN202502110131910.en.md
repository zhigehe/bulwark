Oil falls in early Asian trade after rising overnight. The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, while also introducing new tariffs on Chinese goods and led to retaliatory actions from Beijing, says Tickmill's Joseph Dahrieh. These moves increase trade war risks, which may affect global growth and reduce energy demand, the managing principal writes in a note. "If the trade dispute worsens, it may offset supply-side concerns, resulting in a bearish outlook for crude oil in the medium term," he says. Front-month WTI crude oil futures fall 0.4% to $73.04/bbl; front-month Brent down 0.3% at $76.74/bbl. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
