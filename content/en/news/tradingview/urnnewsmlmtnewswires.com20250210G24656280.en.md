United Arab Emirates-based Aldar Properties (ADX:ALDAR) on Monday proposed an 8.8% yearly increase in shareholder payout as full-year 2024 earnings beat expectations while sales peaked in the thriving domestic real estate market.

The largest listed developer in Abu Dhabi by market capitalization recommended a dividend of 0.185 dirham per share, after paying 0.17 dirham per share a year ago.

The board's proposal came after profit attributable to equity holders of the company for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, jumped year over year to 5.6 billion Emirati dirhams from 3.92 billion dirhams. The real estate giant's revenue and rental income surged to 23 billion dirhams from 14.16 billion dirhams. Analysts polled by FactSet estimated net income of 5.23 billion dirhams and sales of 22.76 billion dirhams.

Underpinning the 62% increase in revenue was the robust demand for Aldar's newly launched and existing residential developments in key UAE destinations, which led to a 20% growth in development sales to a record 33.6 billion dirhams.

Moving on, Aldar's strong visibility on UAE and international revenue over the next two to three years is supported by a record group revenue backlog of 54.6 billion dirhams at the end of December 2024, compared with 36.8 billion dirhams at the end of 2023. Of the total, the UAE development backlog stands at 45.9 billion dirhams.

"In 2025, we will deliver our first residential and retail concepts in Saadiyat Cultural District, which will be a milestone moment for Aldar as we contribute to Abu Dhabi's position as a global capital of arts and culture," Chairman Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak said. "We believe that new development launches across geographies and the expansion of our recurring income portfolio will fuel our growth in the year ahead."

The stock traded 2% higher recently.
