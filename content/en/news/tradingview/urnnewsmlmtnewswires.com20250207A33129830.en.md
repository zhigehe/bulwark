Ali Jaffery and Andrew Grantham over at CIBC noted it's a quiet data week ahead. But they did say manufacturing and wholesale trade data for December, both due out next Friday, should show that the economy ended 2024 on a "solid footing".

The CIBC pair also noted the Bank of Canada's (BoC) Summary of Deliberations on Wednesday could provide more detail as to how policymakers are incorporating trade uncertainty into their decision making process.

Also on the CIBC calendar for release next week is the Market Participants Survey, which is conducted quarterly and is due out Monday. For that survey, BoC staff reach out to a diverse set of participants in financial markets to gather their views on key macroeconomic and financial variables as well as on monetary policy.

The calendar also has December Building Permits data due out Tuesday, while the BoC's Senior Loan Officer Survey, which collects information on the business lending practices of Canadian financial institutions, is slated for release next Friday.
