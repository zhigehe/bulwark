Wedbush Securities views recent results from Palantir Technologies and Salesforce as proof that artificial intelligence is reshaping the software industry.

"The AI software era is now here," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note, highlighting that 2025 will see an enterprise consumption surge, widespread large language model (LLM) adoption, and expanded generative AI use cases. He identified Palantir and Salesforce as the top AI software investments for 2025.

Ives also pointed to Oracle , IBM (IBM), Innodata , Snowflake , MongoDB , Elastic , and Pegasystems as other key AI software beneficiaries.

Following Palantir's stock rally after its latest earnings, Ives believes Wall Street is still underestimating AI's impact on software. He forecasts a $2 trillion capital expenditure cycle over the next three years as enterprises and governments ramp up AI adoption.

Tech earnings have addressed many investor concerns, Ives added, though unexpected challenges may still emerge in this evolving AI landscape.
