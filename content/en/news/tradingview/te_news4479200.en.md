The Shanghai Composite rose 0.15% to around 3,337, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.9% to 10,720 on Friday, recovering from losses in the previous session after the People’s Bank of China pledged to support the economy with loose monetary policy.

The central bank also forecast stable economic growth for China in 2025, as stimulus measures implemented last year begin to revive production, demand, and market sentiment.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump drefrained from enacting reciprocal tariffs immediately, easing concerns about escalating global trade tensions.

Notable performers included Talkweb Information (+6.9%), Beijing Enlight (+20%), IEIT Systems (+4.7%), Digital China Group (+10%), and China Greatwall (+6.3%).

For the week, the Shanghai and Shenzhen indices are set to rise about 0.8% and 1.3%, respectively.
