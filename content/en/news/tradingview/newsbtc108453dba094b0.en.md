Bitcoin price in recent days seems to have dimmed investor’s confidence in the asset for now with the community seeing less buzz as BTC sees fewer green days.

Regardless of this, some analysts are still eager to analyze BTC and its major metric to at least get a perspective on if there’s hope around the corner.

An instance is a CryptoQuant analyst known under the pseudonym ‘Avocado Onchain’ who recently shared an insight on BTC focusing on Binance funding rates. Funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures market, can provide insight into market sentiment.

A decrease in funding rates often suggests growing pessimism, as traders who previously held bullish positions are forced to cover their positions due to mounting losses. This shift in sentiment can have cascading effects, leading to mass liquidations and further price declines.

**Binance’s Funding Rates And Potential for Rebound**

Avocado, has recently examined the implications of Binance’s funding rates in a post titled “Monitoring Binance Funding Rates: Will Bitcoin Rebound After Extreme Fear?” According to the analysis, a notable wave of long position liquidations occurred recently, leaving the market in a state of extreme fear.

Funding rates on Binance, a platform known for its large retail investor base, have shown a pattern that may hint at future price movements. Historically, negative funding rates on Binance have been relatively rare, but when they do occur, they have often preceded significant price rebounds.

Avocado suggests that this dynamic is linked to the behavior of retail traders, who dominate Binance’s trading volume. When these traders display heightened fear—manifested through negative funding rates—Bitcoin has tended to defy the prevailing sentiment and recover.

The analyst also pointed out that during past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded after hitting negative funding rates triggered by large-scale liquidations.

This historical pattern could indicate that, while the current market environment appears grim, further declines in funding rates might signal a reversal. Essentially, if negative funding rates reappear on Binance, it may suggest that the market has reached a point of capitulation, often a precursor to a sustained recovery.

**Bitcoin Market Performance**

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to face challenges in its upward momentum. Although the asset briefly rebounded to $100,000 earlier today following a mixed US jobs report, it quickly lost ground and was unable to sustain this recovery.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $98,226, reflecting a modest 1.8% gain in the past day. Interestingly, while Bitcoin’s price was higher at this time last week, today’s trading volume surpasses last week’s levels. Notably, so far, BTC’s daily trading volume climbed from $34 billion last Friday to over $55 billion today.
