The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed 0.4% to above the 25,640 mark on Thursday, driven by gains in financial and tech stocks, while investors remained cautious ahead of President Trump’s planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs later today.

Brookfield surged nearly 3% as record-high Q4 distributable earnings of $1.3 billion, up 19% YoY, underscored strong asset monetization and investment growth, bolstering confidence in its financial performance.

Tech giants Shopify and Constellation also advanced over 2% and 1%, respectively.

Meanwhile, Sun Life tumbled nearly 9% after missing Q4 earnings and revenue estimates, with revenue falling 11.92% short of expectations and EPS coming in lower than anticipated.
