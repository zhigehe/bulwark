BUCHAREST (Romania), February 13 (SeeNews) - The shares of Romanian construction materials holding company ROCA Industry [BSE:ROC1] and industrial chemicals producer Sinteza [BSE:STZ] will be added to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Frontier Investable Market Index (IMI) and the MSCI Romania IMI on March 1, the Bucharest Stock Exchange said.

The MSCI Frontier Markets indices will thus include 36 Romanian companies, up from 34 currently, following the quarterly index review conducted by global benchmark indices provider MSCI, the Bucharest Stock Exchange, BVB, said in a press release on Wednesday.

ROCA Industry and Sinteza will also be joined by local freight forwarder Trade Transport Services [BSE:TTS] following its reclassification as a Small Cap company, as it will be moved to the MSCI Frontier IMI and MSCI Romania IMI indices from the MSCI Frontier and MSCI Romania indices, which include only Mid Cap and Large Cap companies.

"TTS will be classified in the Small Cap category [...] as the company's capitalization was below the maintenance threshold for the Mid Cap category that was determined by MSCI within the framework of the current review," the Bucharest bourse said.

Romania is currently classified by MSCI as a Frontier Market. In an interview for SeeNews last year, BVB business development head Remus Danila said that insufficient liquidity is the issue that prevents Romania from achieving Emerging Market status from MSCI.

Romania is, however, classified as an Emerging Market by the global indices provider FTSE Russell and is represented in these indices by 11 companies.

ROCA Industry shares traded 1.89% higher at 0.81 lei ($0.17/0.163 euro) as at 1528 CET on February 13.

Shares in Sinteza traded 15% higher at 3.68 lei as at 1204 CET on February 13.

TTS shares changed hands 0.2% lower at 5.04 lei as at 1525 CET on February 13.

(1 euro = 4.9773 lei)
