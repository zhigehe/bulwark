Capital Properties, Inc., a company primarily engaged in long-term ground leases of land in the Capital Center area of downtown Providence, Rhode Island, has released its 2024 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces.

**Financial Highlights**

**Leasing revenue:** $5.626 million, increased by $101,000 from 2023 due to a net increase in rent from tenants and an increase in other revenue, offset by a decrease in revenue from Metropark.

**Operating expenses:** $949,000, increased by $67,000 in 2024 due to professional fees associated with billboard operations, offset by a decrease in property taxes.

**Net income:** $2.003 million, decreased from $2.327 million in 2023, primarily due to a loss on sale of discontinued operations.

**Basic income per common share:** $0.30, decreased from $0.35 in 2023, reflecting the impact of the loss on sale of discontinued operations.

**Business Highlights**

**Business Operations:** Capital Properties, Inc. operates primarily in the leasing sector, focusing on long-term ground leases of land in the Capital Center area of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The company owns approximately 18 acres in this area, consisting of 13 individual parcels.

**Leasing Segment:** The company’s operations are centered around leasing land under long-term ground leases, which include provisions for periodic rent increases and contingent rent based on tenant revenue. The leases are typically triple net, meaning tenants are responsible for property-related expenses.

**Billboard Operations:** Through its subsidiary, Tri-State Displays, Inc., the company leases 23 outdoor advertising locations to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC. The lease includes annual base rent increases and revenue participation from billboard operations.

**Parcel 20 Development:** In January 2024, the company entered into a long-term ground lease for Parcel 20, which includes a historic building. The lease terms require the tenant to obtain necessary approvals for construction before taking possession.

**Parking Operations:** The company leases certain undeveloped parcels for public parking to Metropark, Ltd. A new lease agreement was established in January 2024, returning to a fixed monthly rental payment structure.

**Environmental Remediation:** The company is involved in ongoing environmental remediation related to a 1994 fuel oil leak. A revised remediation plan is being prepared to demonstrate plume stability and eventual site closure.

**Future Outlook:** The company anticipates future development in the Capital Center area will continue to focus on long-term ground leases. The company does not intend to act as a developer for its parcels.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Strategic Initiatives:** The company has focused on maintaining liquidity and funding operations through cash and cash equivalents, investments, and an unused line of credit. It has also entered into a Second Amendment to its Lease Agreement with Metropark to stabilize rental income and settled deferred rent claims. Additionally, the company has been involved in legal proceedings related to environmental remediation and construction cost disputes, which have been resolved with a judgment payment.

**Capital Management:** Capital management activities include maintaining cash and cash equivalents of $850,000 at the end of 2024, with additional investments maturing in 2025 totaling $1,294,000. The company has a $2,000,000 unused line of credit secured by a mortgage on Parcel 5. In 2024, the company declared and paid dividends totaling $1,848,000 or $0.28 per share. The company also has a revolving line of credit agreement with BankRI, which provides a maximum borrowing capacity of $2,000,000 through March 2027.

**Future Outlook:** The company plans to continue its dividend payments, with a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share declared for early 2025. It will also focus on managing its long-term leases and exploring opportunities for future development of its properties in the Capital Center area. The company is evaluating the impact of new accounting standards on its financial statements and is preparing for potential changes in income tax disclosures and expense disaggregation requirements.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Competition:** The company faces competition for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence. The refusal to sell land may restrict the number of interested developers, potentially impacting leasing revenues.

**Collectability of Long-Term Lease Payments:** The company has identified the collectability of long-term lease payments as a critical accounting estimate. Given the length of the remaining lease terms and the magnitude of the amounts yet to be collected, the company has concluded that the remaining stream of lease payments is not probable of collection, which could impact revenue recognition.

**Impact of COVID-19:** The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted Metropark’s parking operations due to a shift to hybrid workplace models, resulting in lower demand for parking spaces. Although a new lease agreement was reached in 2024, the long-term impact on parking revenue remains uncertain.

**Environmental Remediation:** The company is involved in ongoing environmental remediation related to a 1994 storage tank fuel oil leak. Operational issues have impeded remediation activities, and the company is preparing a revised Remediation Action Work Plan. The financial impact of these activities remains a concern.

**Litigation:** The company is also involved in litigation with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC regarding cost-sharing for construction costs. A recent court decision resulted in a judgment against the company, which could affect financial resources.

**Liquidity:** The company’s liquidity is supported by cash equivalents and investments, but any significant changes in these resources could impact its ability to fund operations and pay dividends.

**Operational Risks:** Overall, the company faces operational risks related to its leasing activities, environmental liabilities, and legal disputes, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations.
