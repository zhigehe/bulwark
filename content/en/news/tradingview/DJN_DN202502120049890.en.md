Optimism about the U.S. economy and job market hasn't translated into tangible increases in hiring activity for now, Randstad's chief executive said.

Top executives at the world's largest employment agency by revenue said they are seeing a disconnect between sentiment and reality in the U.S., with businesses talking about a strong job market but recruiters not seeing a surge in hiring just yet.

The final U.S. employment report of the Biden era showed a cooling job market which, according to the economists, is still on solid footing. The U.S. economy added 143,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday, a slowdown in hiring compared with November and December.

The numbers came just as newly sworn-in President Trump rolls out policies in areas ranging from immigration to trade that are likely to affect the labor market.

"We hear a lot of optimism in the U.S., but we haven't seen material uptakes based on that optimism," Randstad Chief Executive Sander van't Noordende said in an interview.

His comments were echoed by Randstad Chief Financial Officer Jorge Vazquez, who said the company is prepared heading into 2025.

While employers in the U.S. are feeling optimistic about the economy and policy changes under the Trump administration, their European counterparts remain cautious about the broader economic situation, van't Noordende and Vazquez said. They noted that companies in Europe are still hiring at a consistent pace, with no significant drops in recruitment levels.

In Europe, hiring activity is stable but there is less optimism about the economic situation, they said.

The U.S. and the eurozone have seen their economic paths diverge over the past two years, with many European economies experiencing sluggish growth in contrast to stronger expansion across the Atlantic.

Even though hiring levels have been weak for some time, recent trends indicate that the global job market is beginning to stabilize, a sign that the worst might be over, van't Noordende and Vazquez said.

"Our clients have been dealing with inflation, high interest rates... so hiring activity has been very low; however, we see early cyclical sectors starting to improve," Vazquez said.

Given the current backdrop, Randstad is focusing on the sectors where it sees growth, namely transport and logistics, Vazquez said. It is also targeting specific industries and job functions that can benefit from deeper expertise and competitive advantage.

"Specialization is key, we are focusing on growth through specialization," van't Noordende said.

However, the auto sector remains under pressure, Vazquez added.

Randstad on Wednesday reported a smaller-than-expected drop in core earnings for the fourth quarter, but issued guidance that fell short of analysts' expectations.

The company said organic revenue trends in January were in line with those of the fourth quarter, when the metric dropped 5.5%, and that transaction volumes in 2025 point to a stabilization. The update sent Randstad shares down as much as 6% before they recovered slightly.

Randstad's outlook was disappointing and points to further earnings declines, ING analyst Marc Zwartsenburg wrote in a research note.

The Dutch firm said fourth-quarter underlying earnings before interest, taxes and amortization--a company-preferred metric--fell to 200 million euros from 265 million euros in the year-earlier period. The figure was above analysts' expectations of 194 million euros, according to a poll of estimates compiled by the company.

Revenue came to 6.08 billion euros, down from the 6.18 billion euros and compared with a consensus of 5.94 billion euros, based on forecasts from 12 analysts.
