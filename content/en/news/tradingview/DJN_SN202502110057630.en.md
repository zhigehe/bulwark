DuPont's stock soared 6% early Tuesday, after the chemcials giant

Wilmington, Del.-based DuPont had a per-share loss of 17 cents for the quarter, narrower than the loss of 72 cents posted in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items, it had EPS of $1.13, ahead of the 98-cent FactSet consensus.

Sales rose 7% to $3.092 billion, also ahead of the $3.068 billion FactSet consensus.

"DuPont (DD) closed out a year of strong financial performance with solid fourth quarter results as we saw continued strength in electronics end-markets and a return to year-over-year top-line growth in Water & Protection driven by further improvement in water and medical packaging end-markets," Chief Executive Lori Koch said in prepared remarks.
