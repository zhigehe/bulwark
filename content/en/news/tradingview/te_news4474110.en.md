The BSE Sensex fell 343 points, or 0.4%, to 76,968 while touching its lowest level in nearly two weeks during morning trade on Tuesday, marking a decline for the 5th session.

Traders were cautious after President Trump announced a global 25% tariff on US imports of steel and aluminum, effective from March 4.

Ongoing foreign fund outflow continued to pressure the index while traders anticipated the release of US inflation data and Fed Chair Powell's testimony before Congress.

However, an upbeat session on Wall Street overnight capped the fall, lifted by Nvidia and other AI-related stocks.

Almost all sectors traded in the red, mainly weighed down by property, auto, and financial services.

The Nifty 50 fell 0.5% to below 23,300, with notable losses from Eicher Motors (-5.7%) after Goldman Sachs lowered its target price despite the company posting an 18% growth in its consolidated net profit.

Other early drops included Apollo Shops (-3.6%), Power Grid (-2.1%), and BEL (-1.9%).
