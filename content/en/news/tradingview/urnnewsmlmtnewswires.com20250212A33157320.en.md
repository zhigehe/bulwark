Orchestra BioMed said Wednesday it presented data showing that its investigational atrioventricular interval modulation, or AVIM, therapy improved echocardiographic markers of diastolic dysfunction, a key factor in heart failure among hypertensive patients.

The company said a retrospective analysis of its Moderato II study data showed that patients with diastolic dysfunction who received six months of AVIM therapy achieved lower office and ambulatory systolic blood pressure.

Echocardiographic changes were consistent with improved myocardial relaxation and diastolic compliance, the company added.
