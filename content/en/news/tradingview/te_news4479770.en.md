The FTSE 100 traded lower on Friday, extending its 0.5% decline from the previous session, with NatWest among the biggest laggards despite posting stronger-than-expected profits and an upbeat outlook.

Shares of the bank fell nearly 2%, even as net interest income slightly exceeded expectations.

Looking ahead, NatWest expressed optimism, stating that 2025 could mark its return to full private ownership, ending UK government involvement since the financial crisis.

The bank also reported full-year earnings that surpassed forecasts for both profit and revenue, while the government further reduced its stake from 7.98% to 6.98%.

Other major stocks weighed on the index, with AstraZeneca, HSBC Holdings, and Relx each down more than 1%.

Unilever and BP also traded lower, while Shell managed to edge higher.

Still, the UK index is set to book gains for the week.
