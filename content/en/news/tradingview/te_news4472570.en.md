New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.2% to close at 12,876 on Monday, as renewed concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs weighed on investor sentiment.

Trump said that he will introduce 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., and will also announce further duties in the coming days in the event a country retaliates.

In China, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, economic data released over the weekend showed consumer inflation accelerated to a five-month high in January, but producer price deflation persisted.

On the corporate front, losses were seen in most large-cap stocks, including Fisher & Paykel (-0.4%), Meridian Energy (-0.2%), Auckland Intl Airport (-0.3%), Infratil (-1%), Contact Energy (-0.5%), Mainfreight (-0.9%), and A2 Milk (-0.3%).

Other notable decliners included Port of Tauranga (-1.2%), Precinct Properties (-1.2%), Argosy Property (-1.5%), and Stride Property (-1.5%).
