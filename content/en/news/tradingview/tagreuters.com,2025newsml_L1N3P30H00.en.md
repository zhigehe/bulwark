Key points:

* Freezing wells cut US output over past six days
* US gas production on track for record high in February
* US LNG export feedgas on track for record high in February

U.S. natural gas futures held near a two-week high on Wednesday on rising flows to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants, a drop in daily output and forecasts for cold weather and higher heating demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.

That lack of price movement came despite forecasts for the return of less cold weather in late February.

Front-month gas futures for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange remained unchanged at $3.517 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 7:50 a.m. EST (1250 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its highest level since January 29 for a second day in a row.

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to 105.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in February, up from 102.7 bcfd in January when freezing oil and gas wells and pipes, known as freeze-offs, cut production. That compares with a monthly record of 104.6 bcfd in December 2023.

But with the return of extreme cold that is again freezing wells in some parts of the country, daily output was on track to drop by 2.8 bcfd over the past six days to a preliminary two-week low of 104.0 bcfd on Tuesday. That compares with a daily record high of 106.7 bcfd on February 6. Analysts noted that preliminary data is often revised later in the day.

Meteorologists projected weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly colder than normal through February 23 before switching to near normal levels from February 24-27.

With mostly colder weather coming, LSEG forecasts that average gas demand in the Lower 48 states, including exports, will rise from 135.5 bcfd this week to 142.0 bcfd next week.

The amount of gas flowing to the eight big U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 15.2 bcfd so far in February, up from 14.6 bcfd in January. That compares with a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023.

On a daily basis, LNG feedgas was on track to hit 15.7 bcfd on Wednesday, up from 15.6 bcfd on Tuesday and an average of 15.1 bcfd over the prior seven days. If correct, LNG flows on Wednesday would be the highest since hitting a daily record of 15.8 bcfd on January 18.

The latest LNG feedgas high came with flows to Venture Global's 2.6-bcfd Plaquemines export plant under construction in Louisiana set to hit a record 1.4 bcfd on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The [United States](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/) became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar, as much higher global prices feed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's 2022 [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/).

Gas was trading around $17 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) (TRNLTTFMc1) benchmark in Europe and at a two-month high of around $15 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) (JKMc1) benchmark in Asia.
