In its preview of Pet Valu's fourth-quarter results, National Bank is projecting EPS of $0.54, in line with consensus; last year was $0.54.

Analyst Vishal Shreedhar is forecasting fourth-quarter sssg of 0.2% vs. last year's 1.9%. SSSG projection reflects basket growth of 2.5% and transaction decline of 2.2%, he adds.

National Bank is modelling SSSG of 1.4%, revenue of $1.19 billion and EPS of $1.60 for 2025.

"Our expectation for 5.0% y/y EPS growth reflects moderate topline growth, partly offset by margin compression (in part due to F/X)," said Shreedhar.

Maintain Outperform rating; $30 price target.
