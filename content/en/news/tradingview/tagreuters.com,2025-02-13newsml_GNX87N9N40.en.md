**Key Upcoming Milestones & Priorities**

Agios expects to achieve the following key milestones in 2025:

* *Thalassemia:* Receive FDA regulatory decision for PYRUKYND for the treatment of adult patients with non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia (PDUFA goal date is September 7, 2025).
* *Sickle Cell Disease:* Announce topline results from the Phase 3 RISE UP study of mitapivat in sickle cell disease in late 2025, with a potential U.S. commercial launch in 2026. Additionally, begin patient enrollment for the Phase 2 study of tebapivat in sickle cell disease in mid-2025.
* *LR-MDS*: Complete patient enrollment in the Phase 2b study of tebapivat for LR-MDS in late 2025.
* *Early-Stage Pipeline:* File an Investigational New Drug Application for AG-236, a siRNA targeting TMPRSS6 intended for the treatment of polycythemia vera, in mid-2025.

**Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results**

*Revenue:* Net product revenue from sales of PYRUKYND for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $10.7 million, compared to $7.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

*Cost of Sales:* Cost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million and $4.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2024.

*Research and Development (R&D) Expenses:* R&D expenses were $82.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $301.3 million for the full year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $295.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses were $51.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $35.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $156.8 million for the full year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $119.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial-related activities as the company prepares for the potential approval of PYRUKYND in thalassemia.

*Net Income (Loss):* Net loss was $96.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $95.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and net income was $673.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $352.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

*Cash Position and Guidance:* Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, were $1.5 billion compared to $806.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase reflects payments from the royalty monetization for vorasidenib and a milestone payment from Servier for vorasidenib approval received in the third quarter of 2024. Agios expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with anticipated product revenue and interest income, will provide the financial independence to prepare for potential PYRUKYND launches in thalassemia and sickle cell disease, advance existing programs, and to opportunistically expand its pipeline through both internally and externally discovered assets.

**Conference Call Information**

Agios will host a conference call and live webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the company’s fourth quarter 2024 financial results and recent business highlights. The live webcast will be accessible on the Investors section of the company's website (www.agios.com) under the “Events & Presentations” tab. A replay of the webcast will be available on the company’s website approximately two hours after the event.
