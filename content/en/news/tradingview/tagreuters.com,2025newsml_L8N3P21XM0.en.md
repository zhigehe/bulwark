German sugar producer Suedzucker forecast on Tuesday 2024/25 earnings at the upper end of its expected ranges but foresaw a moderate decline in revenue in 2025/26, citing high volatility in sales and procurement markets due to the war in Ukraine.

Europe's largest sugar producer said in a statement it expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) at the upper end of a 550 million to 650 million euro range ($569-672 million).

Operating profit is expected at the upper end of Suedzucker's 175 million to 275 million euro band.

For its 2025/2026 financial year, Suedzucker said it expected sugar prices in the European Union to improve considerably but was cautious about its outlook.

"It is important to bear in mind that further impacts from the ongoing war in Ukraine and the resulting continued fundamental increase in the already high volatilities on the sales and procurement markets are to be expected," it said in the statement.

The company said it expects a moderate decline in revenues, a group EBITDA within a range of 525 million to 675 million euros and an operating result between 150-300 million euros.

($1 = 0.9670 euros)
