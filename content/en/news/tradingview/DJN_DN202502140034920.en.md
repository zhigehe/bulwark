Singapore is unlikely to be directly targeted by U.S. reciprocal tariffs, according to Maybank analysts in a note. Trump has announced reciprocal tariffs tailored to each U.S. trading partner, which may take effect as soon as April, they note. "We think Singapore is unlikely to be significantly affected, given that its [free trade agreement] with the U.S. has eliminated duties on most goods," they write. Singapore could also benefit from increased frontloading of orders in 1Q, as producers in other countries expedite their exports to the U.S. ahead of possible tariffs, they add. Maybank forecasts Singapore's 2025 GDP growth to moderate to 2.6%.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)
