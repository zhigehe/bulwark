Deutsche Börse's ISS Stoxx division said the group is formulating a new index without caps on the weightage of individual component stocks, which will run alongside the benchmark index DAX, Reuters reported Monday.

The new index will not limit any company from accounting for more than 15% of the entire index. The German stock exchange operator plans to launch the new index in the first quarter.
