The S&P/ASX 200 Index remained largely unchanged on Wednesday, struggling for direction as Wall Street saw a subdued session overnight.

Investors were weighing President Trump’s latest tariff escalation and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who signaled the central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates further.

Back home, caution prevailed among Australian investors, with many assessing key corporate earnings reports.

Computershare saw a significant 11% surge, reaching record highs after the share registry provider raised its annual earnings growth outlook from 7.5% to 15%.

AGL Energy also saw a 2.5% gain, fueled by a 15% increase in revenue for the six months to December compared to the same period last year.

Meanwhile, Suncorp climbed 3.8%, driven by stronger-than-expected first-half earnings.
