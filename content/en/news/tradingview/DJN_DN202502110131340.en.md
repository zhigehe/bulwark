Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index is 0.2% higher at 1592.72. The local market outlook may remain uncertain, with risks tied to U.S. trade policy. However, clarity on tariffs may lead to mild gains on improving sentiment and reduced foreign fund selling could boost bargain hunting and rotational plays, Apex Securities says in a note. Export-focused sectors like technology, furniture and gloves could benefit from a stronger dollar, while plantation sector may see buying interest from higher CPO prices, it adds. Among gainers, YTL Power International adds 1.2% and YTL Corp. is up 1.5%. Meanwhile, Mr. D.I.Y. Group is down 0.6% and IHH Healthcare is 0.5% lower. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
