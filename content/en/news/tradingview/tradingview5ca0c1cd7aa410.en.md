Terex Corporation, a global manufacturer of lifting and material processing products, has released its fourth quarter and year-end 2024 earnings report. The company has provided detailed insights into its financial performance, strategic initiatives, and future outlook.

**Financial Highlights**

For the full year 2024, Terex reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.11 on sales of $5.1 billion, marking the second highest full-year EPS in the company's history. The fourth quarter saw net sales of $1.2 billion, slightly up from the previous year, with a gross margin of 19%. Operating profit for the quarter was $97 million, while the full year operating profit stood at $582 million. Free cash flow for the year was $190 million, down from the previous year due to various factors including higher interest expenses and increased net working capital.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Terex's Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) and Materials Processing (MP) segments scaled back production in the second half of the year to align with industry-wide channel adjustments. The newly acquired Environmental Solutions Group (ESG) performed well, contributing $51 million in EBITDA on $228 million in revenue for the fourth quarter. The integration of ESG is expected to deliver at least $25 million in operational run-rate synergies by the end of 2026.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Terex has been actively managing its debt and capital structure, maintaining a solid balance sheet with a leverage ratio of 2.6 times. The company returned $92 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2024. The acquisition of ESG is a significant step forward, expected to drive organic growth and profitability improvements.

**Management's Perspective**

Simon Meester, President and CEO of Terex, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting improved safety measures and a strong commitment to Terex's values. Julie Beck, the outgoing CFO, noted the company's efforts in cost reduction and operational efficiency, while incoming CFO Jennifer Kong is expected to continue driving financial and operational improvements.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, Terex anticipates net sales of approximately $5.4 billion with an operating margin of about 12% and EBITDA of roughly $660 million. The company expects a significant increase in free cash flow, driven by working capital reductions and a full year of ESG contributions. The outlook includes a cautious approach to macroeconomic variables and geopolitical uncertainties.
