CLAYMONT, Del., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners II Co. (the “Company”) today announced the closing of its initial public offering of 23,000,000 units, which includes 3,000,000 units issued pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. The offering was priced at $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $230,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.

The Company’s units began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) on February 11, 2025 under the ticker symbol “ATIIU.” Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant.
