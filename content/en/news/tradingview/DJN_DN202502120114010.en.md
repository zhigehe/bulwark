DoorDash is higher after 4Q revenue and orders beat Wall Street estimates, and UBS says the food delivery company should deliver incremental adjusted Ebitda dollars for 2025 to 2027 at least at the levels seen in 2024 of greater than $700M. Still, the analysts say in a research note that there is a lingering unanswered question around the timing of adjusted Ebitda flowthrough. "We continue to prefer Uber given clearer adjusted Ebitda targets through 2026, ongoing platform synergies, and potential for Waymo partnership expansion in 2025," the analysts add. UBS raises its target price to $204 from $200. DoorDash rises 2.8% to $198.52. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
