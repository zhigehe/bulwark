**Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break**

Ethereum price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2,920 resistance, like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $2,800 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone.

The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. The bulls appeared near the $2,525 zone. The price is now moving higher and attempting a fresh increase above the $2,600 level.

Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,700 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,740 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,850 or $2,910. A clear move above the $2,910 resistance might send the price toward the $2,950 resistance.

An upside break above the $2,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term.

**Another Decline In ETH?**

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,525 zone.

A clear move below the $2,525 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,240.
