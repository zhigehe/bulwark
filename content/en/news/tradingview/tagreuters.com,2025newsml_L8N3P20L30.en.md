\*\* Shares of ams OSRAM rise 16.5% to the top of Switzerland's mid-cap index (.SMIM), highest since November, 7 2024, after it reported Q4 results and Q1 guidance above expectations

\*\* Analysts of Jefferies and Stifel said Q4 results were above consensus, while the quarterly forecast was better than the market had feared

\*\* Stifel said Q4 results were a beat on adjusted EBITDA at 22%, reaching 150 million euros ($154.58 million) against a Vara consensus aiming for 123 million euros in the quarter

\*\* Jefferies said "Despite most autos semis companies indicating very weak trends, the company does not see it because the inventory in auto semis is not replicated in the automotive LED market"

\*\* ams OSRAM forecast first quarter revenue below or in line with last year's number due to muted demand for automotive semiconductors, but said it saw recovery in the second half of 2025

\*\* "the balance sheet still remains weak, which means the stock is likely to remain volatile", Jefferies however added

\*\* Shares on track for a best day since July 28, 2023

\*\* Including today's rise the stock has gained 33.69% YTD

($1 = 0.9704 euros)
