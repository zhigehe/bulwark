CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (“CMG Group” or the “Company”) announces its financial results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2024, and the approval by its Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the payment of a cash dividend of $0.05 per Common Share for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024.

**THIRD QUARTER 2025 CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS**

As a result of CMG Group’s acquisition of Sharp Reflections GmbH (“SR” or “Sharp”) on November 12, 2024, the Company’s operations are organized into two reportable operating segments represented by “Reservoir & Production Solutions” segment (“R&P”) which reflects the operations of CMG and includes the development and licensing of reservoir simulation software and “Seismic Solutions” segment (“Seismic”) represented by Bluware-Headwave Ventures Inc. (“BHV” or “Bluware”) and SR and includes the development and licensing of seismic interpretation software.

* Generated total revenue of $35.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $33.0 million in the prior year’s quarter, reflecting a 1% decrease in R&P segment revenue and a 9% contribution from the Seismic segment, of which 6% was growth from acquisitions;
* Operating profit increased to $11.2 million, an increase of 37% from the same period of the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increased software and professional service revenues and a decrease in operating expenses primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation in the quarter as a result of the decrease in share price.

**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**

The company has defined Organic growth to include CMG revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and BHV revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated beginning on October 1, 2024.

*Third Quarter*

In the third quarter, total revenue grew by 8% from the prior fiscal year to $35.8 million, of which 2% was Organic growth and 6% was growth from acquisitions.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 39% compared to 37% in the prior year period, with reductions in the Reservoir and Productions Solutions segment offset by increases in the Seismic Solutions segment.

Net income for the quarter increased to $9.6 million, up from $5.6 million in the prior year period, supported by an increase in operating profit and significant foreign exchange rate gains. Free Cash Flow increased from $0.09 per share in the prior period to $0.11 per share, impacted by the increase in funds flow from operations. At December 31, 2024, the cash balance was $39.7 million, a decrease from $61.4 million at September 30, 2024 due primarily to the acquisition of Sharp Reflections.

Reservoir and Production Solutions

Total revenue declined by 1% with declines in Professional Services revenue partially offset by gains in Perpetual license revenue. Annuity/maintenance (“A/M”) revenue was flat compared to the third quarter of 2024 with decreases in the US, Canada and South America, offset by growth in the Eastern Hemisphere. Software revenue attributable to energy transition was 23% in the quarter, compared to 22% in the comparable prior year period. From a trend perspective, on a year-to-date basis, software revenue attributable to energy transition was 23% compared to 22% in the same period of the previous year.

Operating profit in the segment for the third quarter increased to $7.0 million, from $5.9 million in the prior year period, driven by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense due to lower share price, partially offset by increased expenses, including acquisition related expenses, agent commission and other related fees, and other corporate costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the quarter decreased to 42% from 44% in the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the slight decline in revenue and an increase in expenses.

Maintaining our customary high renewal rates in the fourth quarter will be important for sustaining our current growth trajectory which, on a year-to-date basis, is below our expectation of low double-digits.

Seismic Solutions

Total revenue increased 26% of which 9% was Organic growth and 17% growth from acquisitions.

A/M revenue increased 131% compared to the prior year period, of which 49% was Organic growth, due to an increase in licensing and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. Growth from acquisitions was 82%. Annuity license fee increase of 12% Organic growth was also positively impacted by an increase in licensing and the positive impact of USD/CAD foreign exchange rates.

Operating profit in the segment for the third quarter increased to $4.2 million from $2.3 million as a result of higher revenue and lower G&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.8 million from $2.7 million, of which 6% is from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA Margin grew to 34% from 24% in the prior year. Contract renewals in the Seismic segment typically occur in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA fluctuation on a quarterly basis. As a result of annuity license fee revenue recognition being skewed towards the last two quarters of the fiscal year, Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be lower in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year. We would encourage shareholders to evaluate the Seismic Solutions segment revenue and profitability on a full-year basis.

NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-IFRS MEASURES

Free Cash Flow Reconciliation to Funds Flow from Operations

Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure that is calculated as funds flow from operations less capital expenditures and repayment of lease liabilities. Free Cash Flow per share is calculated by dividing free cash flow by the number of weighted average outstanding shares during the period. Management believes that this measure provides useful supplemental information about operating performance and liquidity, as it represents cash generated during the period, regardless of the timing of collection of receivables and payment of payables, which may reduce comparability between periods. Management uses free cash flow and free cash flow per share to help measure the capacity of the Company to pay dividends and invest in business growth opportunities.

The increase in Free Cash Flow for the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily relates to an increase in net income and decrease in the repayment of lease liabilities relating to timing of payments as the BHV office lease in Houston concluded during the period. The decrease in Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2024, primarily relates to a decrease in net income and increase in repayment of lease liabilities compared to the prior year comparative period as a result of the acquisition of BHV.

(1)   This is a non-IFRS financial measure. Refer to definition of the measures above.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2024, was 39% and 35%, respectively, down from 37% and 43% during the period year comparative periods.

The R&P segment’s Adjusted EBITDA Margin is 42% and 43% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to 44% and 47%, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three months ended December 31, 2024, is primarily due to a slight decline in revenue and increase in other corporate costs. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2024, is primarily due to an increase in headcount and headcount related costs and other corporate costs, partially offset by an increase in total revenues. Refer to the “Operating Expenses” section of this MD&A for further detail on the increase in operating expenses by category.

The Seismic segment’s Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2024, is 34% and 15%, respectively, compared to 24% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023. Seismic Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2024, increased by 79%, of which 6% is due to growth from acquisitions. The increase in Seismic Adjusted EBITDA not related to growth from acquisitions for the three months ended December 31, 2024, is primarily due to higher revenues and lower G&A expenses. Seismic Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 31, 2024, increased by 57%, of which there was an 8% decline due to acquisitions. The increase in Seismic Adjusted EBITDA not related to growth from acquisitions for the nine months ended December 31, 2024, is impacted by the same reasons as the three months ended December 31, 2024. The decrease in Seismic Adjusted EBITDA due to decline from acquisitions for the nine months ended December 31, 2024, is primarily due to negative Adjusted EBITDA in the first six months of fiscal 2025, influenced by revenue recognition being skewed to the last two quarters of the fiscal year. Contract renewals in the Seismic segment typically occur in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA fluctuation on a quarterly basis. As a result of annuity license fee revenue recognition being skewed towards the last two quarters of the fiscal year, Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be lower in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year.
