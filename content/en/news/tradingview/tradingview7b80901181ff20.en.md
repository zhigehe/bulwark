For the fourth quarter of 2024, Global Payments reported a GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.25, marking a 63% increase from the previous year. Adjusted EPS stood at $2.95, up by 12% on a constant currency basis. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $2.52 billion, a 3% increase, while adjusted net revenue reached $2.29 billion, a 6.5% rise excluding dispositions.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Global Payments has made significant strides in its operational transformation, which is expected to deliver more than $600 million in annual run-rate operating income benefits by the first half of 2027. The company has also entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase plan, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

Segment-wise, the Merchant Solutions segment reported revenues of $1.89 billion for the fourth quarter, a 3.6% increase, while the Issuer Solutions segment saw a 2.6% rise in revenues to $646 million.

**Management's Perspective**

Cameron Bready, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "2024 was a pivotal year for Global Payments as we launched our broad transformation agenda to set the future course for our business. We delivered solid financial performance consistent with our expectations, while also successfully reorienting to a unified operating model globally to address our complexity, enhance our agility, and better position the business to execute against our refreshed strategy."

Josh Whipple, Chief Financial Officer, added, "We are pleased with our performance during 2024, which culminated with a sequential acceleration in constant currency growth in both our Merchant and Issuer businesses, excluding dispositions. We also generated strong adjusted free cash flow during the year, while effectively balancing returning capital to our shareholders and reducing our net leverage position."

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, Global Payments expects constant currency adjusted net revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 6%, excluding dispositions. The company also anticipates constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth to be between 10% and 11%.
