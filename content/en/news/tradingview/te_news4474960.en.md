The CAC 40 rose 0.3% to close at 8,029 on Tuesday, marking an eight-month high buoyed by robust performance in the financial sector, even as investors remained cautious amid escalating trade tensions.

Societe Generale led gains with a 3.6% increase, followed by AXA, BNP Paribas, and Credit Agricole, which advanced between 0.7% and 1.4%.

Notably, Kering rose 1.3% despite a 12% drop in Q4 revenue, with the CEO affirming that the luxury group had reached a point of "stabilization." In contrast, ArcelorMittal fell 1.9% after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports with no exemptions, intensifying trade tensions already heightened by a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% levies on imports from Canada and Mexico, which remain on hold, with plans for further reciprocal tariffs.
