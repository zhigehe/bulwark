Compass Minerals International Inc., a leading producer of essential minerals, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial and operational performance, highlighting key metrics and future outlooks in the Salt and Plant Nutrition segments.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Sales:** $307.2 million, a decrease of 10% from the prior-year period due to lower Salt segment sales, partially offset by higher Plant Nutrition segment sales.
* **Gross Profit:** $34.3 million, a decrease of 52% or $36.8 million; Gross Margin decreased by 10 percentage points to 11% due to lower sales volumes and higher per-unit product costs.
* **Operating Earnings (Loss):** $0.5 million, an improvement of $54.1 million from an operating loss of $53.6 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the lithium asset impairment in the prior-year period and lower corporate SG&A expenses.
* **Net Loss:** $(23.6) million, an improvement from a net loss of $(75.3) million in the prior-year period.
* **Basic Net Loss Per Common Share:** $(0.57), an improvement from a net loss of $(1.83) per common share in the prior-year period.

**Business Highlights**

* **Revenue Segments:** The Salt segment experienced a decrease in sales due to lower deicing sales volumes, partially offset by slightly higher average sales prices. The Plant Nutrition segment saw an increase in sales driven by higher sales volumes, despite lower average sales prices.
* **Geographical Performance:** Sales in the United States decreased, while sales in Canada increased slightly. The United Kingdom saw a decrease in sales, and other regions experienced a minor increase.
* **Sales Units:** Salt sales volumes decreased by 13%, with highway deicing volumes down 12% and consumer and industrial volumes down 14%. Plant Nutrition sales volumes increased by 36%, reflecting a return to more normalized sales volumes.
* **Future Outlook:** The company expects Salt segment sales volumes to increase by approximately 7% year over year, with a slight decline in pricing. Plant Nutrition segment sales volumes are expected to improve, but with lower average selling prices due to anticipated weakness in global potash prices. Fiscal year 2025 capital expenditures are projected to be in the $75 million to $85 million range.
