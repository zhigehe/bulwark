Comex gold futures are likely on track to rise beyond resistance at $2,900/oz, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research's Joseph Chai says in a research report. Last Friday's price movements indicate bullish momentum is picking up pace again, the analyst notes. The 20- and 50-day simple moving averages continue to trend upward, providing support for the bullish technical setup, Chai says. The commodity will probably make a fresh attempt to climb above $2,900/oz in coming sessions, he says. If such a breakout occurs, the precious metal is likely to extend gains toward the $3,000/oz level, he adds. Spot gold is 1.1% higher at $2,890.96/oz. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
