Royalty Pharma plc, a leading buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company also provided guidance for the full year 2025.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Royalty Pharma reported Portfolio Receipts of $742 million, a slight increase of 1% compared to $736 million in the same period of 2023. Royalty Receipts grew by 12% to $729 million, driven by strong performance from key products such as Evrysdi, the cystic fibrosis franchise, Trelegy, Xtandi, and Tremfya. However, the full year 2024 Portfolio Receipts decreased by 8% to $2,801 million, primarily due to a high base of comparison from Biohaven-related milestone payments received in 2023.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Royalty Pharma's business performance was bolstered by the addition of royalties on eight new therapies in 2024, with a record $925 million in synthetic royalty transactions. The company significantly expanded its development-stage portfolio by acquiring royalties on four potential new therapies. Notable product launches expected in 2025 include Servier’s Voranigo, Bristol Myers Squibb’s Cobenfy, Ascendis’ Yorvipath, Syndax and Incyte’s Niktimvo, and Geron’s Rytelo.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In January 2025, Royalty Pharma announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, replacing the unused $465 million of the original $1 billion program announced in March 2023. The company also agreed to acquire its external manager, RP Management, LLC, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.1 billion. This acquisition is expected to generate significant cost savings and enhance economic returns on investments.

**Management's Perspective**

Pablo Legorreta, Royalty Pharma’s founder and CEO, expressed confidence in the company's future, highlighting the robust transaction pipeline and significant financial flexibility. He emphasized the strategic benefits of the recent acquisition of the external manager and the new share repurchase program, which underscore the company's strong business fundamentals and commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

**Future Outlook**

For the full year 2025, Royalty Pharma expects Portfolio Receipts to be between $2,900 million and $3,050 million, representing an expected growth of 4% to 9%. The company also anticipates significant new product launches across its royalty portfolio, which are expected to contribute positively to its financial performance.
