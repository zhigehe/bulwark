The European Commission approved Deutsche Börse's acquisition of a stake in Digital Vault Services from Lindner Beteiligungs, according to a Thursday release.

The commission found that the deal, which would result in the German exchange operator owning a joint stake in Digital Vault Services with interior fit-out and building envelope supplier Lindner, would not raise competition concerns.
