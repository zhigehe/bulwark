Swiggy's long-term growth outlook appears robust, Citi research analyst Vijit Jain says in a note. The Indian startup's business execution across food delivery and quick commerce has improved this fiscal year, with innovation and adoption strategies that are critical given the fierce competition in the sectors it operates in, Jain says. While Swiggy's valuation reflects competition and profitability concerns, the analyst views these headwinds as short-term. Swiggy could become profitable in 2026, and there is upside from sustained discipline in its business execution, Jain adds. Citi initiates coverage of the stock with a buy rating and INR480 target price. Shares are 1.5% lower at INR356.60. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)
