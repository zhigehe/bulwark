Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, helped mitigate alcohol cravings in adults with alcohol use disorder in a clinical trial, researchers said in findings published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry.

The researchers said results of the randomized trial offer preliminary prospective evidence supporting efficacy of low-dose semaglutide in reducing alcohol cravings, thus justifying further investigation in larger studies.

The trial that sought to evaluate the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide on alcohol consumption and cravings involved nine weeks of outpatient treatment, with 48 participants receiving small doses ranging from 0.25 milligram to 1 mg per week.

Novo Nordisk did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.
