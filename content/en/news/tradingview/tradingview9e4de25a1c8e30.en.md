Zebra Technologies Corporation, a global leader in digitizing and automating frontline workflows, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024. The company reported significant growth in key financial metrics, driven by robust performance in its North American retail segment.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Zebra Technologies reported net sales of $1,334 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 32.2%. The company's net income surged to $163 million, translating to a net income per diluted share of $3.14, a remarkable increase of 858.8% and 912.9%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS also saw a substantial rise of 133.9% year-over-year to $4.00. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by 90.3% to $295 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Net sales in the Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (EVM) segment were $886 million in Q4 2024, up from $663 million in the prior year, while the Asset Intelligence & Tracking (AIT) segment reported net sales of $448 million, compared to $346 million in the previous year. Consolidated organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by 31.6% year-over-year, with the EVM segment growing by 33.1% and the AIT segment by 28.8%.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $648 million, up from $448 million in the prior year, with a gross margin increase to 48.6% from 44.4%. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributed to volume leverage. Operating expenses rose to $423 million from $374 million, mainly due to higher employee incentive compensation and increased investments in the business.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

For the full year 2024, Zebra Technologies reported net cash provided by operating activities of $1,013 million and capital expenditures of $59 million, resulting in free cash flow of $954 million. The company also made share repurchases worth $47 million and had net debt payments of $43 million.

**Management's Perspective**

Bill Burns, Chief Executive Officer of Zebra Technologies, commented, "Our teams executed well, delivering results that exceeded our outlook. Strong year-end spending by our North American retail customers drove our fourth quarter outperformance. As we enter 2025, our backlog supports solid first quarter growth. For the remainder of the year, we remain cautious in our growth outlook as our customers navigate an uncertain environment including a dynamic global trade, geopolitical, and macro-economic backdrop."

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, Zebra Technologies expects net sales to grow between 8% and 11% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q1 2025 is projected to be approximately 21%, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to range between $3.50 and $3.70. For the full year 2025, the company anticipates net sales growth between 3% and 7%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.75 to $15.25.
