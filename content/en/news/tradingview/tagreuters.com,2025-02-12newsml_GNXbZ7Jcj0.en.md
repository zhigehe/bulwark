*Study Progresses to Fourth Higher 90 mg/m**2* *Dose Cohort*

Compelling Patient Response Highlighted by Stable Disease and Significant Reduction in Blast Count After One Treatment Cycle

HOUSTON, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bio-Path Holdings, Inc., , a biotechnology company leveraging its proprietary DNAbilize® liposomal delivery and antisense technology to develop a portfolio of targeted nucleic acid cancer and obesity drugs, today provides an update from the Company’s ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating BP1002 for the treatment of refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including venetoclax-resistant patients. The Company announced a meaningful patient response to treatment and the clinical trial has progressed to the fourth, higher dose cohort of 90 mg/m2.

“We were excited to learn that one patient in the third cohort had a meaningful response to just one treatment cycle, experiencing stable disease and a significant reduction in blast count, which we believe offers promise for venetoclax-resistant AML patients with limited treatment options,” said Peter Nielsen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Path Holdings. “AML patients that fail or relapse from frontline venetoclax-based therapy have very poor prognosis with a median overall survival of less than three months. The third dosing cohort completed enrollment faster than expected, which we believe reflects the urgent need for additional treatment options. We look forward to quickly advancing this study through the fourth dosing cohort and into the combination therapy segment of this Phase 1/1b study with increased levels of BP1002 for the treatment of these vulnerable patients.”

The current standard of care for patients with AML not eligible for intensive chemotherapy is venetoclax, an oral Bcl-2 inhibitor that targets the BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 protein, in combination with a hypomethylating agent or with low-dose cytarabine. However, many patients become resistant to venetoclax treatment. A published study found that AML patients who had relapsed from frontline venetoclax-based treatment were refractory to salvage therapy and had a median survival of less than 3 months. By targeting Bcl-2 at the mRNA level rather than the protein, BP1002 may overcome and prevent some of the mechanisms of resistance that affect venetoclax treatment.

The Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at several leading cancer centers in the United States, including the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Scripps Health, and The University of California at Los Angeles Cancer Center.   The approved treatment cycle is two doses per week over four weeks, resulting in eight doses administered over twenty-eight days. The Phase 1b portion of the study is expected to commence after completion of BP1002 monotherapy cohorts and will assess the safety and efficacy of BP1002 in combination with decitabine in refractory/relapsed AML patients.

Gail J. Roboz, M.D., is the National Principal Investigator for the Phase 1/1b trial. Dr. Roboz is a Professor of Medicine and Director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Gary Schiller, M.D., The University of California at Los Angeles Cancer Center, Maro Ohanian, D.O., Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and David Hermel, M.D., Scripps Health, are each serving as principal investigators.
