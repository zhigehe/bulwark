* Japanese rubber futures rebounded on Friday, but were set to end the week lower, as traders weighed prospects of weaker supply from Asian producers against global tariff woes.
* The Osaka Exchange (OSE) rubber contract for July delivery , was up 6.3 yen, or 1.72%, at 373.0 yen ($2.44) per kg, as of 0231 GMT.

* Total supply of natural rubber has significantly shrunk as overseas production entered its off-peak season, Chinese commodities data provider Longzhong Information said in a note.

* U.S. President Donald Trump tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, ramping up prospects for a global trade war with American friends and foes.
* China, the world's top rubber consumer, is one of the trading partners targeted by Trump's tariff directive.
