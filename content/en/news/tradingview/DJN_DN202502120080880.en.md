Eurozone government bond yields jump on above-expectations January U.S. CPI data, confirming the Federal Reserve's stance on not hurrying to cut interest rates. "The January U.S. CPI figures will be grim reading for the FOMC," says Pepperstone's Michael Brown in a note. The data could well have been influenced by one-off factors, however, such as the typical chunky price rises that are often seen at the start of the year, the senior research strategist says. Eurozone bond yields rise about 3 basis points in both the short and long ends of the curve versus levels before the data. The 10-year Bund yield rises 3.5 basis points to 2.478% from before, while the 2-year Schatz yield jumps to 2.146% from 2.115% beforehand, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
