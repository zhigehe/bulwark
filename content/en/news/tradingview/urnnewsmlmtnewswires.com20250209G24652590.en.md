The Tadawul All Share Index closed 0.29% in the green as markets await key economic data, including the closely watched US inflation rate figures for January.

According to Saudi Exchange data, the bourse closed with 12,469.14 as 94 shares closed higher, while 134 closed lower at the end of the Sunday session. Shatirah House Restaurant (SASE:6016), d/b/a Burgerizzr, was the top gainer by 5.62%, and Liva Insurance (SASE:8280) was the stock that lost the most at 3.31% lower.

Market watchers across the globe are looking out for Saudi Arabia's December 2024 industrial production on Monday, the US' January inflation report on Wednesday, and its import and export numbers on Friday.

"The US CPI report for January, due Wednesday, will be the main data release next week, with annual revisions also due. Our US economists expect MoM growth for headline CPI to come in at +0.22%, down from +0.4% in December, but growth in the core measure to accelerate to +0.28% from +0.2% in December," Deutsche Bank Research said in a note.

On the corporate front, Twareat Medical Care (SASE:9627) shares closed 1.81% lower as its Innovative Conversion for Industry unit secured its commercial registration. The medical services company said the subsidiary will produce medical and non-medical products.

Meanwhile, The board of Bank Albilad (SASE:1140) proposed to increase its capital by 2.5 billion Saudi riyals to 15 billion riyals. The lender plans to issue a bonus share for every five shares for the increase. Shares added 2.76% at closing.
