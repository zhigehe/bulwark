West Pharmaceutical Services posted a slight decline in profit despite higher sales in its latest quarter, but its guidance for the year came in below Wall Street's estimates.

The maker of pharmaceutical products logged net income of $130.1 million, or $1.78 a share, compared to $137 million, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier.

Stripping out certain one-time items, earnings came in at $1.82 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $1.78 a share.

Sales rose to $748.8 million from $732 million. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $740.5 million.

Chief Executive Eric Green said the company expects momentum to continue in 2025 due to improving trends in biologics and generics.

For 2025, West Pharmaceutical guided for sales between $2.88 billion and $2.91 billion as well as adjusted earnings per-share in the range of $6 and $6.20. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $3.04 billion in sales and $7.45 a share in adjusted earnings.

Shares declined 8.1% to $296.02 in premarket trading. The stock is down about 8.1% over the last year.
