By Robb M. Stewart

Toronto-Dominion Bank will exit its investment in Charles Schwab, the Canadian bank's first big move under new Chief Executive Raymond Chun to shore up its business following a costly money-laundering scandal.

TD said it will offer its 10.1% stake in Charles Schwab through a registered stock offering. The brokerage and money-management firm has agreed to buy $1.5 billion of its shares from TD when the offering is completed.

The Toronto-based bank said it plan to use 8 billion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of about $5.6 billion, of the proceeds to repurchase its shares and will invest the balance of the money raised in its businesses.

TD last year reduced its holding in Charles Schwab from 12% to raise $2.5 billion to set aside money for anticipated U.S. fines. The bank in October reached a historic settlement with U.S. authorities when it pleaded guilty to multiple charges for failings in its anti-money-laundering controls and agreed to pay $3.09 billion in fines and accept limits on its growth in the U.S.
