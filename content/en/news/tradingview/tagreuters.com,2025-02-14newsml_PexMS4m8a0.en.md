**Rosenbauer International AG**

by Mag. Tiemon Kiesenhofer

Business news for the stock market Leonding (pta/14.02.2025/07:20) - \* Significant increase in vehicle deliveries and pricing measures boost turnover to €1,307.0 million \* EBIT reaches an all-time high of €65.2 million despite negative special effects, EBT triples year-on-year to €24.0 million \* Incoming orders of €1,705.2 million and an order backlog of €2,279.8 million are at record levels, ensuring capacity utilization into 2026 \* Rosenbauer Executive Board expects sales to increase further in 2025 to around €1.5 billion, with an EBIT margin of over 6% GROUP KEY FIGURES 2023 2024 (preliminary) Revenues € million € 1,064.5 1,307.0 EBIT € million 37.5 65.2 EBT € million 7.0 24.0 Order intake € million 1,450.3 1,705.2 Order backlog as of December 31 € million 1,788.0 2,279.8 Preliminary figures for 2024 show that the Rosenbauer Group significantly increased its revenues to €1,307.0 million (2023: €1,064.5 million) in a weak economic environment. Vehicle deliveries increased by 10%, with strong growth also recorded in equipment, customer service, and components. All sales regions – particularly Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East & Africa – clearly expanded their business volumes in the reporting year. The initiatives of the past two years have resulted in a record EBIT of €65.2 million (2023: €37.5 million), an increase of 74%. Despite higher financing costs, EBT tripled to €24.0 million (2023: €7.0 million). Without negative special effects of €4.8 million, which were mainly due to implementing the bank agreement, EBIT would have been €70.0 million. Despite the significant revenue increase of 23%, it was possible to reduce trade working capital by 7%. With a share of 32% in terms of revenue or €424.4 million, the previous year's figure of 43% or €456.8 million was significantly improved. This is mainly attributable to lower inventories and significantly higher customer prepayments. Demand for Rosenbauer firefighting technology remains very strong. Incoming orders reached a new record high of €1,705.2 million in the past year (2023: €1,450.3 million). Strong growth was recorded in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and the Americas. The German armed forces agreed a long-term framework contract with Rosenbauer Deutschland for the delivery of up to 60 PANTHER airport firefighting vehicles. The first 35 PANTHER 8x8 vehicles are scheduled for delivery by 2029. At €2,279.8 million as at December 31, 2024 (2023: €1,788.0 million), the order backlog surpassed the Group's annual revenues significantly, ensuring capacity utilization into 2026. The Executive Board expects sales and earnings to increase further in 2025 and anticipates sales of around €1.5 billion, with an EBIT margin of over 6%. The figures quoted for 2024 are based on a forecast in accordance with IFRS. The final figures for 2024 will be published on April 11, 2025.
