Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia's 1Q earnings may dip on quarter due to pre-Lunar New Year front-loading, Maybank IB analyst Jade Tam says in a note. The urgency to raise product prices this year may be less as easing costs for key raw materials like wheat should help stabilize margins despite higher aluminum prices, she says. Tam expects the brewer's 2025 earnings to grow by 4%, supported by moderate volume increases and improved consumer sentiment. Maybank raises Carlsberg's target price to MYR24.40 from MYR23.10 and maintains a buy rating on its undemanding valuations and attractive dividend yield of over 5%. Shares are 0.2% higher at MYR20.30. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
