The Turkish lira hit a record low against the dollar overnight and faces increased volatility in coming months as Turkey's central bank could cut interest rates further despite elevated inflation, Commerzbank analyst Tatha Ghose says in a note. The bank's Governor Fatih Karahan said Friday a pause in rate cuts was possible if the inflation outlook deteriorates but this failed to lift the lira. His comments came as the bank raised its year-end inflation forecast to 24%. A signal that rates could be raised might have reassured markets, Ghose says. However, Karahan's remarks sound "hollow" and suggest he doesn't view the current outlook to be problematic. That means rate cuts could continue. USD/TRY rises 0.1% to 36.0029 after earlier hitting a high of 36.0643, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
