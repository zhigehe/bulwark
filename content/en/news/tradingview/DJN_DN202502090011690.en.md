Fox Corp. has continued its push for Tubi, its free, ad-supported streaming service, by streaming this year's Super Bowl there and running another strange in-game Super Bowl ad. This one stars a man born with a taste for Westerns and a head shaped like a cowboy hat.

The brand gained attention in 2023 with three Super Bowl ads, two that depicted a group of man-sized rabbits dragging viewers down a literal rabbit hole and another in which viewers' TV sets appeared to switch over to Tubi-which wasn't showing the game that year.

This year's ad positions Tubi as a platform that can serve all tastes. Its hat-headed star endures ridicule from peers more fond of fantasy and pirate-themed films until Westerns finally come back into vogue.

Operators of free, ad-backed streaming services hope they can capture more viewers and advertisers as paid services like Netflix and Disney+ raise their prices. Fox this month said that it plans to introduce a new paid streaming service of its own by the end of the year.
