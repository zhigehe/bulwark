The euro's gains could have further to run on optimism over a ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, ING analyst Chris Turner says in a note. "Progress on peace in Ukraine could be an important positive for European countries should it deliver lower energy prices and encourage broader investment on the back of something like a new Marshall Plan," he says. However, the threat of U.S. tariffs on Europe could limit the euro's appreciation. Sticky U.S. inflation and interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar could also hold back the euro. The euro rises 0.3% to $1.0418, having earlier reached a one-week high of $1.0441, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
