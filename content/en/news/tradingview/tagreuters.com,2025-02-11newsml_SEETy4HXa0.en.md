BELGRADE (Serbia), February 11 (SeeNews) - Serbian real estate firm NBB Nekretnine [BEL:BNBR] said it has launched an offer to buy back 10,000 of its own shares representing 2.76% of its total equity capital, for 600 dinars ($5.3/ 5.1 euro) apiece.

The offer is being launched under a buyback programme Belgrade-based NBB Nekretnine announced in June last year, targeting a stake of up to 10%, the company said in a filing with the Belgrade bourse on Monday.

NBB Nekretnine's buyback offer is valid from February 6 until March 7, as per the filing.

Under the June buyback programme, NBB Nekrtenine in December launched an offer to also repurchase 10,000 of its shares. At the time, the company managed to buy 1,133 shares, corresponding to a 0.31% stake.

In March 2024, NBB Nekretnine launched a share buyback programme also targeting a stake of up to 10%. Under that programme, the company repurchased 3,060 of its own shares, corresponding to a 0.84% stake, for 400 dinars per share. NBB Nekretnine later cancelled those shares.

NBB Nekretnine shares haven't traded on the Belgrade bourse in the past 12 months.

Belgrade-based Gigavit owns 86.4% of NBB Nekretnine. The remainder is held by a number of smaller shareholders, with stakes not exceeding 1%, data from Serbia's central securities depository and clearing house showed on Tuesday.
