Malaysian palm oil futures dipped around 1% to below MYR 4,600 per tonne, halting gains in the prior five sessions as traders locked in profits after prices hit a near two-month high earlier in the week.

In India, the top buyer, January imports plunged to a near 14-year low as refiners shifted to cheaper soyoil.

Adding to the bearish pressure, data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) showed a 12.94% mom drop in January exports.

Globally, commodity markets, including palm oil, faced pressure after US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a phone call to start talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.

However, further losses were capped as MPOB data indicated stocks fell to 1.58 million metric tons at the end of January, the lowest since May 2023, while production sank 16.8% to 1.24 million tons.

Looking ahead, demand for palm oil may strengthen starting in March, driven by preparations for the fasting month and the Eid-ul-Fitr festival in April.
