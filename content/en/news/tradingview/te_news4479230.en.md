The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.569 on Friday, extending gains from the previous session, supported by a softer US dollar after President Donald Trump delayed imposing hefty levies.

He stated that reciprocal tariffs would take effect only after the White House reviews appropriate tariff levels for each country, providing some relief to traders.

Meanwhile, US PPI inflation rose more than expected in January, leading markets to push back Fed rate cut expectations to September from June.

Domestically, the RBNZ is expected to cut rates by 50 bps next week to 3.75%, with markets anticipating a further 75 bps reduction this year.

On the data front, New Zealandâ€™s factory activity grew in January for the first time in nearly two years, marking its strongest expansion since September 2022.

For the week, the currency is poised for a second consecutive gain.
