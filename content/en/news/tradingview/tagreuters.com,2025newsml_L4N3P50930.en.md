India's Power Finance Corp (PFC) plans to raise 80 billion rupees ($922.3 million), including a greenshoe option of 66 billion rupees, through the sale of bonds maturing in three years and two months and in six years and 11 months, three bankers said on Friday.

The company has invited coupon and commitment bids from bankers and investors for both the options on Monday, the bankers added.

This is the second time this month that PFC is looking to raise funds through the bond market. In the first week of February, it had raised an aggregate of 39.50 billion rupees through bonds maturing in nearly 10 years and nearly 20 years at 7.24% and 7.25% coupons, respectively.

PFC did not reply to a Reuters email seeking comment.

Here is the list of deals reported so far on February 14

| Issuer | Tenure | Coupon (in %) | Issue size (in bln rupees)\* | Bidding date | Rating |
