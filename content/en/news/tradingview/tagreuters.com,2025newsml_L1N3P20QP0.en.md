U.S. STOCKS SLIP, YIELDS CLAW HIGHER, AS POWELL HITS CAPITAL HILL

The main U.S. stocks indexes are slightly red early on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is not in a rush to cut interest rates given an economy that is "strong overall" and inflation that remains above its 2% target.

Powell is delivering semiannual remarks on monetary policy and the economy in front of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday followed by the House Financial Services Committtee on Wednesday.

According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the market is showing a very slight bias for the Fed's target rate to be in the 4.00%-4.25% area in July vs the current target rate of 4.25%-4.50%. Rates are then expected to flat line into year-end.

A majority of S&P 500 index sectors are lower with utilities taking the biggest hit, while materials are posting the biggest rise. That said, trading appears relatively subdued, with no one sector posting an absolute change of more than 0.8%.

Under the surface, regional banks (.KRX) are among gainers, while gold stocks (.HUI) are on the losing side, down around 1%.

Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield is pushing up around four basis points to the 4.54% area. With this, the yield is attempting to rise for a fourth-straight day.
