Aristocrat Leisure confirmed the completion of the sale of Plarium Global to Sweden-based Modern Times Group, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

The deal is expected to result in a gain on sale in fiscal year 2025. Proceeds from the sale will be deployed consistent with the company's long-term growth strategy and established capital management framework.

In addition, the company will restructure its Big Fish Games operations to solely focus on the operation of its current titles, with no new game development and significantly reduced investment in the Big Fish portfolio.

The gaming firm will also retire the Pixel United reporting segment, replacing it with Product Madness, its core social slots business, effective from the result for the half year ending March 31.

Aristocrat Leisure's shares rose past 1% in recent trading on Thursday.
