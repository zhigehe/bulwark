MIAMI, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. today announced the appointment of John Chidsey to its Board of Directors (the “Board”) as an independent director, effective February 5, 2025. Mr. Chidsey first served on the Board from 2013 to 2022. Mr. Chidsey will serve as Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee and as a member of the Audit Committee. With Mr. Chidsey’s appointment, seven of the eight members of the Board are independent.

"John has deep knowledge of large-scale operations, financial management, and corporate strategy shaped by his previous experience as CEO of Subway and Burger King,” said Harry Sommer, president and CEO at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. “His deep understanding of our industry due to his previous service on the Board will provide invaluable insight into the unique demands of the cruise sector. We are thrilled to welcome him back to the Board as an independent director and look forward to his continued contributions to our success*."* 

In his most recent role, Mr. Chidsey served as CEO of Subway Restaurants for five years, leading the company until his retirement in late 2024. Prior to that, he was CEO of Burger King Holdings, Inc., following his tenure as the company’s President and Chief Financial Officer. Before joining Burger King, he held key leadership positions at Cendant Corporation, where he served as Chairman and CEO of two major divisions. He led the Vehicle Services Division, overseeing brands such as Avis Rent A Car, Budget Rent A Car Systems, PHH, and Wright Express, as well as the Financial Services Division, which included Jackson Hewitt. Earlier in his career, Mr. Chidsey held various senior financial leadership roles at PepsiCo.

Mr. Chidsey has also served on the boards of Encompass Health Corporation, Burger King Holdings (as Chairman), and Brinker International. He holds an MBA in Finance and Accounting and a J.D. from Emory University, as well as a B.A. from Davidson College.

The Board is also actively searching for an additional member to join the Board in the coming months.
