China Longevity Group received a letter stating Alternative Liquidity Index intends to make a pre-conditional voluntary cash partial offer to acquire up to 85,261,250, or 10% of the company's issued shares, at HK$0.01 apiece, a Thursday Hong Kong bourse filing said.

The offeror has requested consent from Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission for the offer, with the regulator's executive director of the corporate finance division indicating inclination to approve it.

The firm will hire an advisor to weigh in whether the offer is fair and reasonable.

Trading in the shares of the polyester fabric manufacturer has been suspended since Feb. 14,Â 2013.
