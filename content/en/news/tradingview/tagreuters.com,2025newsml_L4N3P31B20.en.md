Key points:

* CVS Health rises after beating profit estimates

Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday, as a hotter-than-anticipated inflation reading added to worries that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates anytime soon, while some upbeat earnings like that of CVS Health helped crimp losses.

U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly one-and-a-half years in January, reinforcing the Fed's message that it was in no rush to resume cutting interest rates amid growing uncertainty over the economy.

The surge in prices offered a cautionary note to President Donald Trump's push for tariffs on imported goods, which have been panned by economists as inflationary.

"The CPI report was not a disaster but it's not what the Fed wanted to see either," said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer, at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.

"I think (the Fed) is going to do what's implied by the market."

Traders are now fully pricing in just one more 25 basis point rate reduction this year.

Before the data, they saw an about 40% chance of another similar-sized move, as per LSEG data.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell also began his second day of testimony before Congress on Wednesday. He had reiterated that the U.S. central bank is in no rush to cut its short-term interest rate again when he testified to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.

January's reading is the last inflation reading before any direct impact from Trump's tariff measures, which went into effect this month.

Trump's trade advisers are finalizing plans for the reciprocal tariffs on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports.
