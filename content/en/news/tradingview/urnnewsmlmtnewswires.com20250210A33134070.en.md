PyroGenesis on Monday said recent data from a current contract confirms that PyroGenesis plasma torches require significantly lower operational energy requirements.

Savings of up to 45% compared with legacy diesel burners have been obtained when destroying PFAS, or forever chemicals, the company said.

The latest data shows how a transition from fossil fuels to the plasma torches can generate significant reductions in costs and emissions, and is also consistent with results obtained in other test installations, Pyrogenesis said.
