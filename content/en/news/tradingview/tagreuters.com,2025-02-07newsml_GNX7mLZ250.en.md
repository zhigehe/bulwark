MIDLAND, TX, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Mexco Energy Corporation (NYSE American: MXC) today reported net income of $1,077,370, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the nine months ending December 31, 2024.

Operating revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 were $5,368,327, an increase of 12% when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas production volumes and partially offset by a decrease in the average sales prices of oil and natural gas. Natural gas prices have been low due to limited pipeline capacities in the Permian Basin. Oil contributed to 86% of our operating revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2025.

Net income of $469,133, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 36% compared to $345,610, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were $1,891,265.

The Company currently expects to participate in the drilling of 28 and completion of 19 horizontal wells at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $1.8 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, of which $1.1 million has been expended to date.

Also, the Company has expended to date, approximately $2 million for royalty and mineral interest acquisitions in approximately 700 producing wells with additional potential development located in 37 counties in 9 states.

Mexco Energy Corporation, a Colorado corporation, is an independent oil and gas company located in Midland, Texas engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin.
