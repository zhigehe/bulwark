AutoNation, Inc., one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, has released its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. The company reported significant growth in several key areas, reflecting the strength of its business model and operations.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, AutoNation reported revenue of $7.2 billion, an 8% increase on a same-store basis compared to the same period in 2023. The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $4.64, with an adjusted EPS of $4.97. Despite a 7% increase in revenue, the gross profit saw a modest rise of 2%, reaching $1.24 billion. However, operating income and net income experienced declines of 3% and 14%, respectively.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

AutoNation's new vehicle same-store unit sales grew by 12% in the fourth quarter, with used vehicle same-store gross profit increasing by 14%. The After-Sales and Customer Financial Services (CFS) segments also saw growth, with gross profits rising by 5% and 6%, respectively. The company originated $1.1 billion in loans through its AutoNation Finance division during 2024.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

AutoNation repurchased $460 million worth of shares in 2024, representing a 7% reduction in outstanding shares. The company also maintained a strong balance sheet, reducing leverage sequentially to 2.4X in the fourth quarter. Additionally, AutoNation Finance reported a positive income of $1 million for the quarter, a significant improvement from a loss of $4 million a year ago.

**Management's Perspective**

Mike Manley, AutoNation’s Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results, stating, "Our fourth quarter performance reflects the strength of AutoNation’s business model and operations. We achieved double-digit new vehicle unit growth, gaining share in the markets we serve, while also meaningfully increasing used vehicle, Customer Financial Services, and After-Sales gross profit. Further, we continued to expand our AutoNation Finance business and to enhance our loan portfolio, by originating more than $1 billion in loans during 2024 and selling most of the legacy, sub-prime portfolio."

**Future Outlook**

AutoNation remains confident in its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and is focused on delivering attractive shareholder returns. The company has a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion available, including $60 million in cash and $1.3 billion under its revolving credit facility.
