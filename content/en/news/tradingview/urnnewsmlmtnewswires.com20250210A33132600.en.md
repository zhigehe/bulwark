Mizuho Financial Group Inc is close to acquiring a 63% stake in Indian investment bank Avendus Capital from KKR, Bloomberg News reported Monday citing people familiar with the matter.

The companies are still discussing the details of a potential transaction that may take place in the next few weeks. However, the sources said the talks could still fall apart.

The deal may value Avendus at about $800 million, the sources told Bloomberg.

Mizuho and Avendus did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment on the matter, and KKR declined to comment.
