Our asset management business had inflows of over $135 billion, our wealth solutions business is now firmly established as a top-tier annuity writer in the U.S., and our operating businesses continue to generate high-quality and stable cash flows.”

He continued, “We expect the positive momentum in each of our businesses to continue this year. Our access to scale capital remains very strong and with transaction activity expected to pick up throughout 2025, we are well positioned to continue to generate strong growth in our cash flows and intrinsic value.”

*See endnotes on page* *8**.*

Total consolidated net income was $101 million in the quarter and $1.9 billion for the year. Distributable earnings before realizations were a record $1.5 billion ($0.94/share) for the quarter and $4.9 billion ($3.07/share) for the year.

Our asset management business generated a 17% increase in fee-related earnings compared to the prior year quarter, benefiting from strong fundraising momentum and the scaling of its credit platform through strategic partnerships.

Wealth solutions earnings nearly doubled compared to the prior year, on the back of the acquisition of American Equity Life (“AEL”), organic growth and the attractive returns on our investment portfolio.

Our operating businesses continue to deliver stable and growing cash flows, underpinned by the strong earnings of our renewable power and transition, infrastructure and private equity businesses and 4% growth in same-store net operating income (“NOI”) from our core real estate portfolio.

During the quarter and for the year, earnings from realizations were $108 million and $1.4 billion, with total DE for the quarter and for the year of $1.6 billion ($1.01/share) and $6.3 billion ($3.96/share), respectively.

**Regular Dividend Declaration**

The Board declared a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend for Brookfield Corporation to $0.09 per share (representing $0.36 per annum), payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on March 14, 2025. The Board also declared the regular monthly and quarterly dividends on our preferred shares.

**Operating Highlights**

Distributable earnings before realizations were a record *$1.5 billion* *(**$0.94**/share) for the quarter and* *$4.9 billion* *(**$3.07**/share) for the* *year**, representing an increase of* *24%* *and* *15%* on a per share basis over the prior year periods, respectively. Total distributable earnings were *$1.6 billion* *(**$1.01**/share) for the quarter and* *$6.3 billion* *(**$3.96**/share) for the* *year**.*

*Asset Management:* 

* DE was $694 million ($0.44/share) in the quarter and $2.6 billion ($1.67/share) for the year.
* Fee-related earnings grew by 17% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an 18% increase in fee-bearing capital over the prior year to $539 billion as at December 31, 2024. Total inflows were over $135 billion in 2024.
* Our latest round of flagship funds have raised approximately $40 billion across our second global transition fund strategy, our fifth opportunistic real estate fund strategy, and our flagship opportunistic credit fund strategy. Heading into 2025, we expect to hold final closes for our latest flagship funds and continue to actively deploy capital, which should contribute to strong earnings growth.

*Wealth Solutions:*

* Distributable operating earnings were $421 million ($0.26/share) in the quarter and $1.4 billion ($0.85/share) for the year.
* Insurance assets increased to over $120 billion, as we originated approximately $19 billion of retail and institutional annuity sales in 2024. We continue to diversify the business by growing our pension risk transfer capabilities and expanding into new markets. An example of this is the completion of our first reinsurance transaction in the U.K., at $1.3 billion which closed in the fourth quarter.
* The average investment portfolio yield was 5.4%, 1.8% higher than the average cost of capital. As we continue to rotate the investment portfolio, annualized earnings for the business are well positioned to grow from approximately $1.6 billion today to $2 billion in the near term.
* We are raising close to $2 billion of retail capital per month via our combined wealth solutions platforms.

*Operating Businesses:* 

* DE was $562 million ($0.35/share) in the quarter and $1.6 billion ($1.03/share) for the year.
* Operating Funds from Operations in our renewable power, transition and infrastructure businesses increased by 10% over the prior year. Our private equity business continues to contribute resilient, high-quality cash flows. Our core real estate portfolio continues to grow its same-store NOI, delivering a 4% increase over the prior year quarter.
* In our real estate business, we signed close to 27 million square feet of office and retail leases during the year. Rents on the newly signed leases were approximately 35% higher compared to those leases expiring in the fourth quarter. Also during the fourth quarter, our DE benefited from monetizing a land parcel within our North American residential operations.
* As real estate markets continue to recover in the coming years, we expect earnings and valuations of the business to strengthen.

Earnings from the monetization of mature assets were *$108 million* *(**$0.07**/share) for the quarter and* *$1.4 billion* *(**$0.89**/share) for the* *year**.*

* During the year, we closed nearly $40 billion of asset sales at strong returns, which include a portfolio of U.S. manufactured housing assets and several renewable power and infrastructure assets globally. With the pick-up in transaction activity, we expect this momentum to accelerate into 2025.
* Total accumulated unrealized carried interest was $11.5 billion at year end, representing an increase of 13% over the prior year, net of carried interest realized into income. We recognized approximately $400 million of net realized carried interest into income in 2024, and we expect to realize significant carried interest as we actively monetize assets in the coming years.

*We ended the quarter with a record* *$160 billion* of capital available to deploy into new investments.

* We have record deployable capital of approximately $160 billion, which includes $68 billion of cash, financial assets and undrawn credit lines at the Corporation, our affiliates and our wealth solutions business.
* Our balance sheet is robust and remains conservatively capitalized. Our corporate debt at the Corporation has a weighted-average term of 14 years and today we have no maturities through to the end of 2025.
* Over the year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases, with total share buybacks of approximately $1 billion. In 2025 so far, we have repurchased over $200 million of shares.
* We had an active year in the capital markets. We executed approximately $135 billion of financings, including issuing $700 million of 30-year subordinated notes and a $1 billion, 7-year non-recourse loan to a large institutional partner of ours, the proceeds of which will mainly be directed towards share repurchases.

**Non-IFRS and Performance Measures**

This news release and accompanying financial information are based on International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), unless otherwise noted.

We make reference to *Distributable Earnings (“DE”).* We define DE as the sum of distributable earnings from our asset management business, distributable operating earnings from our wealth solutions business, distributions received from our ownership of investments, realized carried interest and disposition gains from principal investments, net of earnings from our Corporate Activities, preferred share dividends and equity-based compensation costs. We also make reference to *DE before realizations*, which refers to DE before realized carried interest and realized disposition gains from principal investments. We believe these measures provide insight into earnings received by the company that are available for distribution to common shareholders or to be reinvested into the business.

Realized carried interest and realized disposition gains are further described below:

* *Realized Carried Interest* represents our contractual share of investment gains generated within a private fund after considering our clients’ minimum return requirements. Realized carried interest is determined on third-party capital that is no longer subject to future investment performance.
* Realized Disposition Gains from Principal Investments are included in DE because we consider the purchase and sale of assets from our directly held investments to be a normal part of the company’s business. Realized disposition gains include gains and losses recorded in net income and equity in the current period, and are adjusted to include fair value changes and revaluation surplus balances recorded in prior periods which were not included in prior period DE.

We use DE to assess our operating results and the value of Brookfield Corporation’s business and believe that many shareholders and analysts also find these measures of value to them.

We make reference to *Operating Funds from Operations* (“*Operating FFO*”). We define Operating FFO as the company’s share of revenues less direct costs and interest expenses; excludes realized carried interest and disposition gains, fair value changes, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes; and includes our proportionate share of FFO from operating activities recorded by equity accounted investments on a fully diluted basis.

We make reference to *Net Operating Income (“NOI”)*, which refers to the revenues from our operations less direct expenses before the impact of depreciation and amortization within our real estate business. We present this measure as we believe it is a key indicator of our ability to impact the operating performance of our properties. As NOI excludes non-recurring items and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared to prior periods, reflects the impact of operations from trends in occupancy rates and rental rates.

We disclose a number of financial measures in this news release that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures, which include DE, should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, similar financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures or other financial metrics are not standardized under IFRS and may differ from the financial measures or other financial metrics disclosed by other businesses and, as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and entities.

We provide additional information on key terms and non-IFRS measures in our filings available at www.bn.brookfield.com.

There can be no assurance that comparable results will be achieved in the future, that future investments will be similar to historic investments discussed herein, that targeted returns, growth objectives, diversification or asset allocations will be met or that an investment strategy or investment objectives will be achieved (because of economic conditions, the availability of appropriate opportunities or otherwise).
