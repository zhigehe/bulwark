Centene and the federal government have agreed to dismiss the company's lawsuit over a potentially costly drop in its star rating quality measure for private Medicare Advantage plans, a court filing showed Tuesday.

The health insurer and its affiliates joined the US Department of Justice to ask that the suit be "dismissed without prejudice as to all claims, causes of action, and parties, with each party to bear its own attorneys' fees and costs," according to a filing in the US District Court for the Eastern District Of Missouri.

Centene didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.

The company's shares were down 1% in recent Wednesday trading.
