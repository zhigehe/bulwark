The Bank of Thailand is mostly likely to lower rates in April, Citi Research economist Nalin Chutchotitham says in a report. This view is based on factors including an expected narrowing of Thailand's negative output gap in the near term and domestic inflation remaining above 1% in 1Q, the economist says. However, there's a risk that the BOT might cut rates sooner, in February, given that monetary policy operates with a long lag and any material downside surprises in the upcoming 4Q 2024 GDP data could increase this risk, the economist adds.
