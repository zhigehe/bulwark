Broker Views Snippets

* Macquarie on Bravura Solutions ⬆️: “The outlook is supported by ongoing revenue upgrades and operating leverage supported by cost efficiency. Further upside is possible from delivering on revenue growth opportunities.” UPGRADE TO OUTPERFORM, PRICE TARGET RAISED TO $3.17 FROM $2.05.
* Citi on Imdex ⬆️: “Resilience amid steady yet subdued environment best reflects IMD’s interim result. With this, IMD has effectively addressed our skepticism around FY25 earnings Expectations. There’s increased optimism of recovery in FY26.” UPGRADE TO NEUTRAL, PRICE TARGET RAISED TO $2.85 FROM $1.95.
* Macquarie on Qantas Airways ⬇️: “QAN FY25 outlook is strong. Reports of falling domestic prices, competitive capacity on larger routes like US and Europe clouding the FY26 outlook. EV/EBITDA multiple is now at a 10-year peak (ex COVID) which captures the structural changes to the cost base.” DOWNGRADE TO NEUTRAL.
* UBS on JB HI-FI ⬆️: “We revise FY25E/26E EPS +3.2%/+3.8% due to higher JB Aust (higher sales, flattish EBIT margins) and lower net interest. Retain Sell despite another JBH result that drove upgrades to mkt EPS as earnings multiples are too elevated relative to history and peers making the relative risk reward unattractive.” PRICE TARGET RAISED TO $90 FROM $72.
* Macquarie on Pilbara Minerals ⬇️: “After a period of restriction, we resume coverage of PLS with a Neutral rating. We evaluate PLS in the context of its Lithium sector peers, noting its underlying asset quality and lowrisk profile. However, we acknowledge its valuation is driven heavily by long-term fundamentals and short-term valuation metrics screen as expensive.” RESUME AT NEUTRAL, PRICE TARGET $2.30 FROM $3.25.

How to read broker recommendations 🔎

Typically, there are two major components of a broker’s view:

Rating: A call to action, usually along the lines of buy, hold, or sell, but depending on the broker’s ratings system, can be somewhere in between (e.g., accumulate or add is typically between a hold and a buy).

Price target (PT): The price at which the broker expects the stock will be trading at some point in the future, generally within the next 12 months.
