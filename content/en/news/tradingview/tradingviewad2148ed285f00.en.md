Live Ventures Incorporated, a diversified holding company, has released its financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2025, ending December 31, 2024. The company reported a mixed performance across its various segments, reflecting both strengths and challenges in the current economic environment.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fiscal first quarter of 2025, Live Ventures reported revenue of $111.5 million, a decrease of 5.2% compared to $117.6 million in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter was $0.5 million, translating to diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, a significant improvement from the net loss of $0.7 million and loss per share of $0.22 in the prior year period. The company's adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million, down 33.9% from $8.7 million in the previous year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The Retail-Entertainment segment saw a revenue increase of 3.3% to $21.3 million, driven by higher consumer demand for used products. However, the Retail-Flooring and Flooring Manufacturing segments experienced declines in revenue by 7.5% and 11.1%, respectively, due to reduced consumer demand. The Steel Manufacturing segment also saw a slight revenue decrease of 2.8%, although it benefited from a $3.1 million contribution from the acquisition of Central Steel Fabricators, LLC.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

During the quarter, Live Ventures achieved a $2.8 million gain on the settlement of the earnout liability related to the Precision Metal Works, Inc. acquisition and a $0.7 million gain on the settlement of PMW seller notes. The company also reported total assets of $395.5 million and stockholders’ equity of $73.3 million as of December 31, 2024.

**Management's Perspective**

David Verret, Chief Financial Officer of Live Ventures, commented on the improved operating performance in the Retail-Entertainment and Steel Manufacturing segments, despite challenges in the Retail-Flooring and Flooring Manufacturing segments due to high interest rates and a slowdown in the housing market. Jon Isaac, President and CEO, expressed confidence in the long-term strength of the company's businesses, despite the current industry-specific headwinds.

**Future Outlook**

While the company did not provide specific guidance for the next reporting period, management's commentary suggests a focus on enhancing the efficiency of the flooring businesses to mitigate the impact of reduced consumer demand. The company remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of its diversified portfolio.
