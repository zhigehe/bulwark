The president's 25% levy on steel and aluminium imports is meant to keep out China and help local industry. But boosting output would take years and huge investment with murky returns. That would keep the US reliant on Canada and producers like Rio – only at a higher price.

CONTEXT NEWS

U.S. President Donald Trump on February 10 imposed a blanket 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminium. The measures take effect on March 12.

Trump also revoked exemptions to his 2018 levies on the metals that had been granted to countries and blocs including Canada, Mexico, Australia, the European Union, and the UK. At the time, he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium.
