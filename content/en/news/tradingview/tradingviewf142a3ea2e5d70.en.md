Notably, Unitil Energy serves the capital city of Concord and surrounding areas in New Hampshire, while Northern Utilities extends its services to the city of Portland, Maine.
* **Sales Units**: As of December 31, 2024, Unitil served approximately 109,400 electric customers and 89,100 natural gas customers. The company reported an increase in electric kilowatt-hour sales by 1.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, with residential sales increasing by 1.6% and commercial and industrial sales by 1.1%. Gas therm sales decreased by 0.7% in 2024 compared to 2023.

The company's natural gas operations are conducted through Northern Utilities and Fitchburg, with a strong presence in healthcare, education, and government sectors.
* **Future Outlook**: Unitil anticipates continued growth in customer numbers and service areas, particularly following the acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas Company. The company is also focused on maintaining and enhancing its infrastructure to support reliable service delivery and meet regulatory requirements.

**Strategic Initiatives**

Unitil Corporation has undertaken several strategic initiatives to enhance its financial flexibility and support growth:

* **Acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas Company**: This acquisition expands Unitil's natural gas distribution footprint, enhancing its service territory and customer base.
* **Infrastructure Investments**: Unitil has focused on infrastructure investments, with projected capital spending of $176 million for 2025, primarily for utility system additions.
* **Increased Borrowing Capacity**: The company has increased its borrowing capacity by amending its Credit Facility, raising the limit from $200 million to $275 million, to support its capital needs.
* **Capital Management**: Unitil has actively managed its capital structure by issuing long-term debt to refinance existing obligations and fund general corporate purposes. In 2024, the company issued $110 million in long-term debt across its subsidiaries. The company also maintained a strong dividend policy, increasing its annual dividend to $1.70 per share in 2024, with a further increase to $1.80 per share announced for 2025.
* **Future Outlook**: Looking ahead, Unitil plans to continue its strategic focus on infrastructure investments and maintaining financial flexibility. The company aims to leverage its increased Credit Facility to support ongoing capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. Unitil's commitment to a stable dividend policy is expected to continue, with the recent increase in the dividend rate reflecting confidence in its financial position.

**Challenges and Risks**

Unitil Corporation faces several challenges and risks, which it is actively managing:

* **Operational Risks**: The company faces significant operational risks due to potential disruptions in interstate natural gas pipeline transmission and storage capacity, which could impair its ability to meet customer demands. Additionally, the aging infrastructure and inherent hazards in electric and natural gas distribution activities pose risks of accidents, environmental pollution, and operational impairments.
* **Cybersecurity Risks**: The company is vulnerable to technological failures, cyber-attacks, and other disruptions that could impair its operational and information systems, leading to unanticipated losses and expenses. The theft or improper disclosure of sensitive data could also harm the company's reputation and financial condition.
* **Workforce Risks**: The inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce, including key employees and those with specialized skills, could adversely affect the company's operations. Labor disputes and pandemic illnesses could also disrupt operations and financial performance.
* **Regulatory Risks**: The company is subject to comprehensive regulation, which could affect its rates, authorized rate of return, and cost recovery. Changes in environmental regulations, particularly those related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, could increase compliance costs and impact financial results.
* **Financial Risks**: The company may face challenges in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, which could affect its financial condition. Changes in interest rates and taxation could also adversely impact financial results. Additionally, declines in capital market valuations could necessitate substantial cash contributions to pension and post-retirement benefit obligations.
* **General Risks**: Economic conditions, including downturns and high energy costs, could reduce customer demand and affect the company's financial condition. Weather-related sales fluctuations and catastrophic events, such as severe weather or terrorist attacks, could also impact operations and financial performance.

Management is addressing these challenges by pursuing strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas Company, to enhance growth and operational capabilities. The company is also committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to regulatory changes to mitigate environmental risks.
