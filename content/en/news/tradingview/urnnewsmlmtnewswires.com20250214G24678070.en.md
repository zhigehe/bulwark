The People's Bank of China plans to use various monetary policy tools and adjust the intensity and timing of policies to keep ample liquidity, Xinhua reported Thursday, citing a report from the central bank.

The PBOC has trimmed the reserve requirement ratio 29 times since 2013, decreasing the average RRR to 6.6% from 20.1%. It has also conducted government bond purchases amounting to 1 trillion yuan in 2024 to maintain ample liquidity, the report said.
