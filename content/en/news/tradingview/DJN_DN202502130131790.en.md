Investments in AI and cloud will drive global IT spending growth to 9% this year, S&P Global Ratings says in a report. "Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are significantly increasing capital expenditure despite emerging AI efficiency gains," S&P says, adding the robust spending plans come amid DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthroughs. The agency also says the semiconductor industry is sharply divided, "with AI-driven demand surging while traditional markets such as PCs, automotive, and industrial segment face headwinds." In the face of possible tariffs, customers have been accelerating hardware purchases, S&P adds. (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)
