Contemporary Amperex Technology's secondary listing in Hong Kong should facilitate access to international capital, global investors and funding for its global expansion, Bernstein analysts write in a note. With 260 billion yuan in cash on the balance sheet, the company doesn't necessarily need the cash, and the listing proceeds will be mainly used to fund the battery maker's 100 GWh Hungary battery plant, they say. CATL is more positive on battery demand growth than Bernstein, with the company's forecast for 2030 25% higher than the asset manager's projection. Bernstein maintains its outperform rating on the stock with a target price of CNY340. Shares last closed at CNY261.39. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
