(TheNewswire)

Kelowna, BC – TheNewswire - February 11, 2025 — Forbidden Spirits Distilling Corp. (NEX: VDKA -the "Company" or“Forbidden Spirits”)provides an update concerning the foreclosure of the property locatedat 4380 Wallace Hill Road, Kelowna BC (the “Property”).

The Company leases a portion of the Property from Apple Orchard RVLtd. (the “Landlord”), anentity that is controlled by related parties of the Company, andoperates its business from the Property.

On November 4, 2024, the Supreme Court of British Columbia issued anorder (the “Order”) providing, among other things, that theProperty be offered for sale free and clear of all encumbrances andgranting Instafund Mortgage Management Corp. (the “Creditor”) exclusive conduct ofthe sale of the Property.

As a consequence of the Order, the Company understood that theCreditor or any purchaser of the Property could require vacatepossession of the Property, which would result in the Company ceasingto be able to continue its operations on the Property.  The Companyalso understood that it may be required by law to also abandon certainof its assets that are deemed to be fixtures of the Property.  Inlight of the foregoing, on December 17, 2024, the Company entered intoa Memorandum of Understanding with the Creditor, the Landlord andBlair Wilson and Kelly Wilson (each an insider of the Company and alsothe sole shareholders of the Landlord) pursuant to which the Companyagreed that it would cooperate in good faith in furtherance of thesale of the Property and granted the Creditor the right, though notthe obligation, to sell all or substantially all of the Company’sassets in the sale of the Property, including all equipment used bythe Company in relation to its business and located upon the Property(the “Company’sFixtures”), as well as all licenses, operating systems, stockin trade, work in progress and all goodwill, including all marks andbrands associated with the Company (the “Company’s Other Assets”).

On January 23, 2025, the Creditor accepted an offer to purchase theProperty and the Company’s Fixtures (the “Offer”). The Offer, which remainssubject to court approval, stipulates that the purchaser will notassume any existing leases or tenancies relating to the Property andrequires vacant possession of the Property.  The Offer alsocontemplates that the purchaser will not acquire any of theCompany’s Other Assets. It is anticipated that on or about February19, 2025, the Creditor will seek an order from the Supreme Court ofBritish Columbia approving the sale of the Property and theCompany’s Assets on the terms set out in the Offer and that theCompany will then be required to vacate the Property on or beforeMarch 6, 2025.

Assuming that the Offer receives the required court approval and theCompany cannot come to an agreement with the purchaser allowing theCompany to continue operations on the Property, the Company will berequired to source an alternative location from which to operate itsbusiness.  Any such disruption in the Company’s operations wouldhave a material and adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, theCompany would need to acquire new assets to replace the Company’sFixtures.  The Company does not have the financial resources toacquire such assets and the Company can provide no assurance that itwill be able to raise sufficient funding to do so in the future.

The Company continues to be subject to a failure to file cease tradeorder (the “FFCTO”) thatwas issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission (the “BCSC”) against the Company on May8, 2023 for failing to file certain outstanding continuous disclosuredocuments in a timely manner.  On July 9, 2024, the BCSC granted theCompany a partial revocation order which permitted the Company toraise a limited amount of funds, the amounts raised were notsufficient to enable the Company to complete all rectification mattersrequired to seek a full revocation order of the FFCTO.  The Companycan provide no assurance that it will be able to raise additionalfunding in the future and, at this time, does not anticipate being ina position to rectify its continuous disclosure record, seek a fullrevocation of the FFCTO and apply to the TSX Venture Exchange toreturn to trading.
