Neal Katyal, a former acting U.S. solicitor general in the Democratic Obama administration, has left the partnership of international law firm Hogan Lovells to join competitor Milbank, the New York-founded firm said Wednesday.

Katyal will lead Milbank's appellate practice from Washington, the firm said. His corporate clients have included Google, Nvidia and Coinbase, and he has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to his new firm.

Katyal, a vocal critic of Republican President Donald Trump, represented Hawaii in the U.S. state's challenge to the first Trump administration's travel ban that sought to block people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.

He also worked with the state of Minnesota supporting its prosecution of Minneapolis police officers for the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

Hogan Lovells is on the legal team representing families of transgender children who have sued to block Trump's order in January ending all federal funding or support for healthcare that aids gender transitions for people younger than 19. Katyal was not a part of the lawsuit.

Katyal said in a statement released by Milbank he has worked with his new firm before, and that his work at Milbank will have him practicing more before the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Katyal co-led Hogan Lovells' appellate practice alongside Cate Stetson, who will continue to lead the practice, the firm said. Hogan Lovells said it thanked Katyal for his contributions.

Katyal is representing Google in an antitrust lawsuit brought by "Fortnite" video game maker Epic Games. The tech giant has asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block a judge's order requiring it to redesign its Play Store.

He also represented the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary LTL Management, which was created by the company to shoulder nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging the company's Baby Powder and other cosmetic products containing talc cause cancer. J&J said its talc products are safe. His 2022 hourly rate in talc bankruptcy case was $2,465.

Katyal served as acting U.S. solicitor general from May 2010 to June 2011. He took over the role from Elena Kagan, who was tapped by Democratic President Barack Obama to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
