South Korea's Seoul Southern District Court found HSBC's Hong Kong unit not guilty of violating the Capital Markets Act, Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday.

Local prosecutors filed the case against the British lender's subsidiary after it allegedly engaged in the illegal short-selling of shares amounting to 15.8 billion South Korean won in 2021.

The court said there was no evidence proving that the concerned employees were aware that they were infringing on the law.
