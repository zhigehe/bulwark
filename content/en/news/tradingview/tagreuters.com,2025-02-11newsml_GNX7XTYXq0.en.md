PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AVE, the residential real estate brand of Korman Communities, today announces that it was named No. 1 nationwide in renter satisfaction for the third consecutive year. The KingsleySurveys Elite 5 ranks the top five property management companies based solely on renter survey scores.

There are three tiers of property management companies, and they are grouped according to the number of units in their portfolio. This prestigious distinction signifies AVE's mission to deliver elevated apartment living through high-touch service, quality apartments and amenities, and a strong sense of community.

“We are honored to receive the Kingsley Excellence Award for the third year in a row,” said President of AVE and COO of Korman Communities Lea Anne Welsh. “This accolade is especially meaningful to our team as the rankings are completely based on resident feedback. We take great pride in our hospitality- and community-driven approach to apartment living, which includes friendly service coupled with unparalleled amenities and lifestyle programming.”

To qualify for a Kingsley Excellence Award, a property’s resident satisfaction must exceed the Kingsley IndexTM, the most comprehensive performance benchmarking database in the real estate industry, representing more than 7 million prospects and residents surveyed annually.

“I want to wish AVE a well-deserved congratulations on earning this prestigious recognition,” said Grace Hill CEO Kendall Pretzer. “Winning a Kingsley Excellence Award highlights your commitment to delivering exceptional service and exceeding industry standards. This achievement is a testament to your dedication to creating outstanding experiences for residents and customers.”

Three AVE communities – AVE Florham Park, The Franklin Residences, AVE Las Colinas – were also recognized among the Top 100 individual apartment communities in the country for their outstanding performance in resident satisfaction. This esteemed recognition highlights how AVE exceeds industry standards by providing an exceptional living experience for its residents.
