BioVersys identified up to five lead candidates for the oral medicine it is developing against non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM.

The Swiss biopharmaceutical company confirmed that the BV500 NTM program's oral lead candidates work against NTM in vitro and in vivo, enabling potential treatment for difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant NTM lung disease in cystic fibrosis patients.

The program is supported and funded by non-profit medical research organization LifeArc through the CF AMR Syndicate Collaborative Discovery Program.
