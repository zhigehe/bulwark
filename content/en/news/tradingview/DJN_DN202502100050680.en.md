Hain Celestial lowers its annual guidance amid problems in the company's snacks and personal care businesses. The organic food maker says poor "in-store performance" in snacks hurt Hain's F2Q results, with problems tied to marketing and promotions. Hain also experienced challenges with tea ingredients, the company says. Hain cuts its outlook for both earnings and sales in 2025, and says it is exploring strategic options for its personal care business. Hain posts sales of $411M, below analyst estimates, and its adjusted EPS also misses expectations. Hain Celestial is off 7% premarket. (jesse.newman@wsj.com)
