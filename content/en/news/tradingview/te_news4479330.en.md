Malaysian palm oil futures hovered near MYR 4,600 per tonne, rebounding from steep losses in the previous session after the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) projected tight inventories in February due to weak production and strong consumption ahead of the Ramadan fasting month.

The contracts are on track for a fourth consecutive weekly gain, rising about 1.9% so far, as the MPOC expects prices to climb to MYR 4,850 in the coming weeks.

This outlook is supported by a potential demand recovery from top buyer India and strengthening prices of rival soybean and sunflower oils.

On the global front, US President Trump's plans for reciprocal global tariffs are not set to take effect until April, providing more time to avert a trade war.

Meanwhile, in key buyer China, the central bank has signaled potential policy adjustments in response to rising global risks and sluggish domestic demand.
