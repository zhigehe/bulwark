12.2.2025 14:40:08 CET | Aqua Bio Technology ASA | Additional regulatedinformation required to be disclosed under the laws of a member state

Preliminary estimates for the fiscal year 2024 indicate a significant negativeresult for the ABT Group, despite an increase in revenue due to completedacquisitions.

The negative result is mainly attributed to operating losses in two of theGroup's subsidiaries and significant impairments of goodwill related to thebankruptcy of the subsidiary Skinteam Norge AS. In light of this, the Groupplans a series of restructuring measures expected to contribute to a modestlypositive EBITDA level for 2025.
