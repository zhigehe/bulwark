NatWest reported a solid set of results and upgraded guidance that aligns with consensus, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says in a research note after the British lender's quarterly print. It guided for a return on tangible equity between 15% and 16% for 2025, while consensus estimates stood at 15.7%. NatWest also guided for total income for the year in the 15.2 billion to 15.7 billion pound range, in line with expectations of 15.5 billion pounds. The lack of share-buyback announcement might be slightly disappointing, analysts write, noting the 15.5 pence-a-share dividend was better than expected. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)
