Win Hanverky expects a post-tax loss of around HK$60 million for the year 2024, down from HK$383 million a year prior, a Thursday filing on the Hong Kong bourse said.

The garment manufacturer attributed the lower anticipated loss mainly to a higher operating profit from its sportswear manufacturing business, as well as an absence of loss from discontinued operations of the fashion brand Champion.

Revenue from the company's sportswear manufacturing and high-end functional outerwear manufacturing businesses rose by 31% and 47% to HK$2.46 billion and HK$864 million, respectively.
