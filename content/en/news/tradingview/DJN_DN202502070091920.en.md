Coty will likely remain bearish around the state of the beauty industry in its upcoming results, expected for Monday. While the company will likely benefit from a growing fragrance market in the U.S., its color cosmetics business is expected to be weaker. That market is rapidly slowing, according to L'Oréal's Finance Chief Christophe Babule. Coty, together with its peers in the beauty industry, have lost billions of dollars in market cap. Coty currently has a market value of around $5.9 billion, down around 40% from a year ago. e.l.f. Beauty, one of its biggest competitors on the CoverGirl brand side, has seen its stock plunge nearly 60%, while Estée Lauder has lost 55%. Industry giant L'Oreal has remained in a more stable position, but has still experienced stock losses of around 19%. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
