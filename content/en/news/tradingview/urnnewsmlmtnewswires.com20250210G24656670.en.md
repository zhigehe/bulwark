Bayer filed an application with the European Medicines Agency for an extended six-month treatment interval for the Eylea 8-milligram solution for injection.

The treatment, jointly developed by Bayer and Regeneron, is meant for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, the German pharmaceutical and biotechnology group said Monday.

The submission is based on three-year results from open-label extension studies of the Pulsar clinical trial for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration and the Photon trial for diabetic macular edema.
