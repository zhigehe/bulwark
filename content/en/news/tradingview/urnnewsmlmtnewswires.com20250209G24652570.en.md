(Updates to add additional details)

Power and Water Utility Co. for Jubail and Yanbu (SASE:2083), d/b/a Marafiq, attained financial closure for its Al-Haer independent sewage treatment plant project worth 1.5 billion Saudi riyals.

The closure follows the completion of the project's requirements with Banque Saudi Fransi (SASE:1050), Arab Petroleum Investments Corp., and Riyad Bank (SASE:1010), as well as the receipt of Saudi Water Partnership certificates, according to a Sunday release.

The water and wastewater infrastructure developer said Sunday the plant, expected to have a 200,000 cubic meter treatment capacity, will be created using a build, own, operate model and start operations in December 2026.

The plant will feature treated sewage effluent special facilities, a transmission system, a pumping station, and storage tanks, according to a separate same-day release.

The project was done by a consortium that included the utility company, Miahona (SASE:2084), and NV Besix.
