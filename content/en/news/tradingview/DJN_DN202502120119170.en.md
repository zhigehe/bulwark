By Paulo Trevisani

The Vermont Housing Finance Agency plans to sell $45 million of municipal bonds to support affordable homeownership around the state.

The agency's sale of Multiple Purpose Bonds consists of two tranches, according to a preliminary official statement posted on MuniOS. Investors will be offered $30 million in tax-exempt securities designated as Social Bonds, and $15 million in federally taxable securities.

Serial bonds in Series A will mature from November 2034 through November 2037, and the four term bonds being offered will come due from November 2040 through November 2055. Serial bonds in Series B will mature from May 2026 through November 2034.

The bonds are expected to be available for delivery on March 11.

Proceed will be used, in part, to finance single-family mortgage loans through the purchase of Federal Agency Certificates, according to the official statement, and pay issuance costs. The bonds are backed by the agency's revenue and assets.

The securities are rated Aa1 by Moody's and AA+ by Fitch.

J.P. Morgan is lead underwriter on the sale.
