Thyssenkrupp can't rule out that U.S. tariffs might prompt Chinese steel exporters to look to other markets, putting pressure on European steelmakers, Chief Financial Officer Jens Schulte tells journalists during a post-earnings call. Schulte says the company doesn't currently know how the situation will unfold over the coming months, but it is possible that Chinese players that currently deliver to the U.S. could try to deliver more steel into Europe. The potential development needs to be analyzed in detail as the degree of pressure on Europe would depend on the type and quality of the steel imports, Schulte says. Thyssenkrupp shares trade 9.3% higher to 4.95 euros. (pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)
