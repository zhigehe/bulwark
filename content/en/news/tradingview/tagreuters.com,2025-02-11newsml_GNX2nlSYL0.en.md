WATERTOWN, Mass., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cangrade today announced a women- and minority-owned business discount for Jules—the company’s first AI Copilot created to help human resources (HR) professionals make more strategic talent decisions. The addition of Jules to this discount will further enhance businesses’ hiring and talent management decisions by leveraging the valuable data they already have.

Jules gathers intelligence from Cangrade’s talent assessment to answer important questions and uncover insights about everything from hiring and employee growth and development to personal motivators and strategies for improvement. By arming women- and minority-led businesses with powerful and accessible talent intelligence, personalized strategies, and performance predictions, Cangrade aims to even the playing field for those looking to hire and retain top talent.

In honor of Black and Women’s History Months, respectively, Jules is now included in the 35 percent discount on Cangrade’s hiring software. The discount represents the 35 percent of black business owners who are women, 35 percent of women who hold tech positions, the nearly $35,000 less that female entrepreneurs ask for compared to men, and the $35,000 less in startup capital that black entrepreneurs receive on average compared to white ones.

With the future of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives uncertain, one thing remains true: the ability to create better teams attracts better talent. Jules not only helps companies build better teams, but provides the intelligence to support them. Operating as an AI-powered I/O psychologist, Jules enables users to achieve success in areas from performance optimization and crafting the perfect offer letter, to navigating difficult conversations and motivating individuals.

“Over the last several years companies have followed the latest trends in DEI, creating initiatives with good intentions, but in reality were overly performative and ineffective,” said Gershon Goren, Founder and CEO, Cangrade. “We’re putting our money where our mouth is, providing valuable resources that measurably increase the accuracy of performance predictions and remove biases from the hiring process. The result is a stronger and more inclusive workforce.”
