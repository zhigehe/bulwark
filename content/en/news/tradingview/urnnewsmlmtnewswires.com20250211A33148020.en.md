The US Consumer Price Index is expected to rise by 0.3% in January after a 0.4% gain in December, according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg, with the year-over-year rate forecast to remain at 2.9%.

The CPI data are scheduled to be released at 8:30 am ET Wednesday. Annual revisions will be included in the data.

Energy prices are expected to rise more slowly after a 2.6% gain in December while food prices are expected to increase after a 0.3% gain in the previous month.

The same survey looks for a 0.3% gain in core CPI, excluding the volatile food and energy components, after a 0.2% gain. The year-over-year rate is expected to slow to 3.1% from 3.2%.

Prices in the owners' equivalent rents and regular rents categories are expected to rise modestly after slightly faster gains in December. Those two categories combine for nearly one-third of overall CPI and a key focus for the Federal Reserve.

The Fed's preferred inflation measures, the overall and core PCE price readings, are due to be released on Feb. 28. The CPI data are used by many analysts as a precursor to that report.
