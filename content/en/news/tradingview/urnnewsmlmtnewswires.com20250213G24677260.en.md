HealthCo Healthcare and Wellness REIT said it has been approached by a consortium led by HMC Capital's private equity division to potentially lease 11 hospitals owned by the company and an unlisted healthcare fund (UHF), according to a Friday filing with the Australian bourse.

HCW said that, due to Healthscope's ongoing lease obligations as the current tenant of these 11 properties and recent market speculation, it is actively evaluating proposals from other hospital operators.

The real estate investment trust and the UHF have made it clear that no further rental support will be provided to Healthscope, the filing added.

Shares of HealthCo Healthcare and Wellness REIT rose past 1% in recent Friday trade.
