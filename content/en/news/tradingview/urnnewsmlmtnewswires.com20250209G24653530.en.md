Solstice Minerals completed step-out drilling to extend its Edjudina range greenfield gold target at its Yarri project in Western Australia, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The drilling yielded similar geological sequences to its reconnaissance drilling at the target in late 2024, with further testing planned for the remaining 4-kilometer-long target, pending assay results, the filing said.

Shares of the company fell nearly 6% in recent Monday trade.
