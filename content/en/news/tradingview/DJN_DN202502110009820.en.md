Recent market reactions highlight the difficulty investors face in assessing policies such as tariffs, according to Schroders Investment Management economists in a commentary. "Financial markets are not waiting to discover all the details before pricing possible impacts and this is leading to increased volatility across asset classes," they note. Regarding the impact of tariffs on China, the country is likely to devalue its currency to offset the effects, as it did during the first trade conflict, if a compromise is not reached soon, the economists say. However, the rapid imposition of tariffs also increases the likelihood of a larger fiscal stimulus to support domestic growth in China, they add. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
