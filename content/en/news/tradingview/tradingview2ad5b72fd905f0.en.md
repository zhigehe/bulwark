Bruker Corporation, a leader in scientific instruments and analytical solutions, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. The company has shown significant growth and strategic advancements, as detailed in its latest SEC 8-K filing.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Bruker reported revenues of $979.6 million, marking a 14.6% increase year-over-year. The company's organic revenue growth was 3.9%, with constant-exchange rate (CER) revenue growth at 15.8%. The Bruker Scientific Instrument (BSI) segment saw a 4.5% organic revenue increase. The non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 2024 was 18.1%, while GAAP diluted EPS stood at $0.09, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.76, up 8.6% year-over-year.

For the full year 2024, Bruker achieved revenues of $3.37 billion, a 13.6% increase from 2023. Organic revenue growth was 4.0%, and CER revenue growth was 14.0%. The BSI segment's organic revenue grew by 4.2%. The company's FY 2024 GAAP diluted EPS was $0.76, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.41, down 6.6% year-over-year due to the impact of strategic acquisitions.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Bruker completed several strategic acquisitions in 2024, enhancing its portfolio with key platforms in spatial biology, molecular diagnostics, and lab automation. These acquisitions have positioned the company to access larger addressable markets with strong secular tailwinds. The BSI segment's revenues for Q4 2024 were $911.3 million, a 16.3% increase year-over-year, while the BEST segment's revenues were $72.1 million, a 4.1% decrease year-over-year.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In the first half of FY 2024, Bruker closed several strategic acquisitions, which initially had a net dilutive impact on operating margin and EPS. Despite these challenges, the company has made significant progress in integrating these acquisitions, leading to substantial organic operating margin improvements in Q4 2024. Bruker also issued a public offering of common stock, raising $403 million.

**Management's Perspective**

Frank H. Laukien, Bruker’s President and CEO, described 2024 as a transformational year for the company. He highlighted the successful completion of strategic acquisitions and the company's ability to deliver above-market organic and double-digit CER revenue growth for the fourth consecutive year. Laukien expressed confidence in Bruker's capacity to drive solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, and double-digit EPS growth in 2025 and beyond.

**Future Outlook**

Bruker has provided its financial guidance for FY 2025, expecting revenues between $3.47 billion and $3.54 billion, representing a 3% to 5% year-over-year growth. The company anticipates CER revenue growth of 5% to 7%, organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, and M&A revenue growth contribution of 2% to 3%. Non-GAAP EPS is projected to be between $2.67 and $2.72, an increase of 11% to 13% year-over-year, with CER non-GAAP EPS growth of 14% to 16%.
