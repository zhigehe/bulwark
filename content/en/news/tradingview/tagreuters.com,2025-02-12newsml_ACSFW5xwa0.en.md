**DENVER, CO / ACCESS Newswire / February 12, 2025 /** Viably (formerly Komptech Americas), a leading supplier of innovative waste processing solutions in North America, proudly announces its expansion as the nationwide distributor for Scott Equipment Company's Turbo Separator food waste depackaging systems within organics recycling for the commercial composting market. With the addition of California to its territory, Viably now offers this state-of-the-art food waste recycling technology across the entire United States and Canada, further empowering businesses to pursue sustainable organics waste management solutions.![](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-12:newsml_ACSFW5xwa-7c6e3d0614446e4c2cc05f6d5d76f7fb-resized.jpeg)

Turbo Separator model T42 food waste depackaging system.

The Turbo Separator is designed to help commercial compost facilities, food manufacturers, waste haulers, landfills, and other environmental organizations efficiently process packaged food waste and recover valuable organic material. Featuring multiple stationary models and a newly introduced mobile unit, the Turbo Separator provides a flexible and powerful solution for commercial compost facilities. Additional technology, known as Cleansweep, works in conjunction with the Turbo Separator as a secondary system to remove microplastics and other small contaminants from organic materials.

A Proven Solution for California's Waste and Recycling Industry

The expansion of offering Turbo Separator food waste depackagers in California aligns Viably with one of the largest markets for organics waste recycling in the country. The Turbo Separator is particularly well-suited for addressing California's SB 1383 legislative push to divert organic waste from landfills.

"Becoming the nationwide distributor for the Turbo Separator in the organics recycling market is a milestone for Viably," said Brandon Lapsys, President at Viably. "The addition of the California territory allows us to bring Scott Equipment Company's industry-leading solutions to even more organizations seeking innovative technologies to improve their organics waste processing capabilities."

By helping commercial composting facilities optimize their organics recycling efforts, Viably will further assist California businesses in meeting regulatory requirements while cutting costs and reducing environmental impact.

Demonstrations and Support for the California Market

In addition to the four stationary product models of Turbo Separator, Viably will also begin offering its new mobile Turbo Separator unit. This mobile tool is ideal for commercial compost facilities, waste haulers, landfills, and other environmental organizations looking to introduce efficient food waste depackaging solutions across multiple locations or without investment in permanent infrastructure.

Viably works closely with its customers, offering personal consultations to identify challenges and opportunities for streamlining processes with cutting-edge technology. Focusing on building long-term partnerships, Viably ensures that every client benefits from tailored solutions that deliver exceptional performance and profitability.
