CEO Comment

"Ryder delivered strong results in 2024 and year-over-year earnings growth during the fourth quarter, despite ongoing freight market headwinds," says Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez. "This marks the first quarter in the last eight with year-over-year comparable earnings growth. These results were driven by double-digit earnings growth in each of the segments, reflecting the strength of our contractual lease, supply chain, and dedicated businesses. Our ability to generate ROE of 16% during this extended freight cycle downturn continues to demonstrate consistent execution and the resilience of our transformed business model.

"SCS delivered record fourth-quarter earnings which benefited from higher volumes and optimization efforts in our omnichannel retail vertical. In FMS, lease earnings growth more than offset headwinds in rental and used vehicle sales, resulting in solid pretax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue of 11.6%. DTS also delivered record fourth-quarter earnings reflecting strong performance in our legacy business and the Cardinal acquisition.

"The earnings power of our contractual businesses continues to increase our capital deployment capacity, enabling us to invest in profitable growth and strategic initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and increased dividends.

"I am proud of our team's ongoing execution of our balanced growth strategy. Our transformed business model is significantly outperforming prior cycles and we are confident that it will continue to deliver higher highs and higher lows, demonstrating the durability of the enhanced model."

Corporate Financial Information

Tax Rate

Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 25.4%, as compared to 22.5% in the prior year, and our comparable effective income tax rate (a non-GAAP measure) from continuing operations was 24.8%, as compared to 22.1% in the prior year, due to lower discrete tax benefits.

Capital Expenditures, Cash Flow, and Leverage

Full year capital expenditures decreased to $2.7 billion in 2024 compared to $3.3 billion in 2023, primarily reflecting reduced investments in the ChoiceLease fleet due to lower sales activity.

Full year net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2023, due to timing of vendor payments and prefunding of future required pension contributions. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $133 million compared to negative $54 million in 2023, reflects reduced capital expenditures partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of used vehicles and property and lower cash from operating activities.

Debt-to-equity as of December 31,Â 2024 was 250%, compared to 232% at year-end 2023, and is at the bottom end of the company's long-term target of 250% to 300%.

Outlook

"We expect the positive momentum in our contractual businesses to continue into 2025, contributing to higher earnings in all business segments," says Ryder Chief Financial Officer Cristina Gallo-Aquino. "The high end of our 2025 forecast range assumes continued contractual earnings growth and a very modest improvement in rental demand later in the year. We remain well-positioned to benefit from a cycle upturn in all our business segments and are confident that secular growth trends continue to support long-term revenue and earnings growth."

Note: Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements and information included in this news release are "forward-looking statements" under the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including: our forecast; our outlook; our expectations regarding market conditions, such as rental demand and weakening used vehicle sales and rental; our expectations regarding the freight cycle, including timing and the impact of the freight cycle on our businesses; our expectations regarding total and operating revenue, earnings per share, comparable earnings per share, adjusted ROE, earnings before income tax, net cash from operating activities from continuing operations, debt-to-equity, capital expenditures, operating cash flow and free cash flow, and the causes of change; our ability to execute our balanced growth strategy; the impact of inflationary pressures; our expectations regarding commercial rental demand and utilization and used vehicle sales volume and pricing; our expectations regarding long-term profitable growth and secular growth trends; our expectations regarding used vehicle inventory and fleet size; our ability to outperform prior cycles; our ability to support organic growth, including growing our contractual lease, dedicated, and supply chain businesses at targeted returns; our expectations regarding strategic investments and acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Cardinal Logistics; our expectations with respect to our actions to increase returns and create long-term value; and our expectations regarding our ability to return capital to shareholders, including through share repurchases and dividends. Our forward-looking statements also include our estimates of the impact of residual value estimates on earnings and depreciation expense that is based in part on our current assessment of the residual values and useful lives of revenue-earning equipment based on multi-year trends and our outlook for the expected near- and long-term used vehicle market. A variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause residual value estimates to differ from actual used vehicle sales pricing, such as changes in supply and demand of used vehicles; volatility in market conditions; changes in vehicle technology; competitor pricing; regulatory requirements, including changes to tariffs; driver shortages; customer requirements and preferences; and changes in underlying assumption factors.

All of our forward-looking statements should be evaluated by considering the many risks and uncertainties inherent in our business that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include: changes in general economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and worldwide; supply chain and labor challenges and vehicle production constraints, including original equipment manufacturer delays; the effect of geopolitical events; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including lower than expected contractual sales, decreases in commercial rental demand or utilization, poor acceptance of rental pricing, declining market demand for or excess supply of used vehicles impacting current or estimated pricing, and our anticipated proportion of retail versus wholesale sales; declining customer demand for our services; higher than expected maintenance costs; lower than expected benefits from our cost-savings initiatives; our ability to effectively and efficiently integrate acquisitions into our business; lower than expected benefits from our sales, marketing, and new product initiatives; setbacks in the economic market or in our ability to retain profitable customer accounts; impact of changing laws and regulations, such as tariffs, trade restrictions or trade agreements; difficulty in obtaining adequate profit margins for our services; inability to maintain current pricing levels due to, for example, economic conditions, business interruptions, expenditures, labor disputes, and extreme weather or other natural occurrences; competition from other service providers; changes in technology and new entrants; professional driver and technician shortages resulting in higher procurement costs and turnover rates; impact of supply chain disruptions; higher than expected bad debt reserves or write-offs; decrease in credit ratings; increased debt costs; adequacy of accounting estimates; our ability to effectively and efficiently integrate acquisitions into our business; higher than expected reserves and accruals particularly with respect to pension, taxes, insurance, and revenue; impact of changes in our residual value estimates and accounting policies, including our depreciation policy; unanticipated changes in fuel and alternative energy prices; unanticipated currency exchange rate fluctuations; fluctuations in inflation or interest rates; our ability to manage our cost structure; and the risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The risks included here are not exhaustive. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

  RYDER SYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES APPENDIX - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE   
  RECONCILIATIONS - UNAUDITED Set forth in the table below is an overview of   
each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation   
 of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.   
     See reconciliations for each of these measures following this table.

 Operating Revenue Measures:   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
 Operating Revenue FMS Operating         Operating revenue is defined as total   
 Revenue SCS Operating Revenue DTS       revenue for Ryder or each business   
 Operating Revenue Operating Revenue     segment (FMS, SCS and DTS) excluding   
 Growth FMS EBT as a % of FMS            any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted   
 Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a % of     transportation. We use operating   
 SCS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a %    revenue to evaluate the operating   
 of DTS Operating Revenue                performance of our core businesses   
                                         and as a measure of sales activity at   
                                         the consolidated level for Ryder   
                                         System, Inc., as well as for each of   
                                         our business segments. We also use   
                                         segment EBT as a percentage of   
                                         segment operating revenue for each   
                                         business segment for the same reason.   
                                         Note: FMS EBT, SCS EBT and DTS EBT,   
                                         our primary measures of segment   
                                         performance, are not non-GAAP   
                                         measures. Fuel: We exclude FMS, SCS   
                                         and DTS fuel from the calculation of   
                                         our operating revenue measures, as   
                                         fuel is an ancillary service that we   
                                         provide our customers. Fuel revenue   
                                         is impacted by fluctuations in market   
                                         fuel prices and the costs are largely   
                                         a pass-through to our customers,   
                                         resulting in minimal changes in our   
                                         profitability during periods of   
                                         steady market fuel prices. However,   
                                         profitability may be positively or   
                                         negatively impacted by rapid changes   
                                         in market fuel prices during a short   
                                         period of time, as customer pricing   
                                         for fuel services is established   
                                         based on current market fuel costs.   
                                         Subcontracted transportation: We   
                                         exclude subcontracted transportation   
                                         from the calculation of our operating   
                                         revenue measures, as these costs are   
                                         also typically a pass-through to our   
                                         customers and, therefore,   
                                         fluctuations result in minimal   
                                         changes to our profitability. While   
                                         our SCS and DTS business segments   
                                         subcontract certain transportation   
                                         services to third party providers,   
                                         our FMS business segment does not   
                                         engage in subcontracted   
                                         transportation and, therefore, this   
                                         item is not applicable to FMS.

 Comparable Earnings Measures:   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
 Comparable Earnings before Income       Comparable EBT, Comparable Earnings   
 Taxes (EBT) Comparable Earnings         and Comparable EPS are defined,   
 Comparable Earnings per Diluted         respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings   
 Common Share (EPS) Comparable Tax       and EPS, all from continuing   
 Rate Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE)    operations, excluding (1)   
                                         non-operating pension costs, net and   
                                         (2) other items impacting   
                                         comparability (as further described   
                                         below). We believe these non-GAAP   
                                         measures provide useful information   
                                         to investors and allow for better   
                                         year-over-year comparison of   
                                         operating performance. Non-operating   
                                         pension costs, net: Our comparable   
                                         earnings measures exclude   
                                         non-operating pension costs, net,   
                                         which include the amortization of net   
                                         actuarial loss and prior service   
                                         cost, interest cost and expected   
                                         return on plan assets components of   
                                         pension and postretirement benefit   
                                         costs, as well as any significant   
                                         charges for settlements or   
                                         curtailments if recognized. We   
                                         exclude non-operating pension costs,   
                                         net because we consider these to be   
                                         impacted by financial market   
                                         performance and outside the   
                                         operational performance of our   
                                         business. Other Items Impacting   
                                         Comparability: Our comparable and   
                                         adjusted earnings measures also   
                                         exclude other significant items that   
                                         are not representative of our   
                                         business operations and vary from   
                                         period to period. Comparable Tax Rate   
                                         is computed using the same   
                                         methodology as the GAAP provision for   
                                         income taxes. Income tax effects of   
                                         non-GAAP adjustments are calculated   
                                         based on the marginal tax rates to   
                                         which the non-GAAP adjustments are   
                                         related. Adjusted ROE is defined as   
                                         adjusted net earnings divided by   
                                         adjusted average shareholders' equity   
                                         and represents the rate of return on   
                                         shareholders' investment. Other items   
                                         impacting comparability described   
                                         above are excluded, as applicable,   
                                         from the calculation of adjusted net   
                                         earnings and adjusted average   
                                         shareholders' equity. We also exclude   
                                         any significant charges for pension   
                                         settlements or curtailments from the   
                                         calculation of adjusted net earnings.   
                                         We use adjusted ROE as an internal   
                                         measure of how effectively we use the   
                                         owned capital invested in our   
                                         operations.   
--------------------------------------  --------------------------------------   
 Comparable Earnings Before Interest,    Comparable EBITDA is defined as net   
 Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization    earnings, first adjusted to exclude   
 (EBITDA)                                discontinued operations and the   
                                         following items, all from continuing   
                                         operations: (1) non-operating pension   
                                         costs, net and (2) any other items   
                                         that are not representative of our   
                                         business operations (these items are   
                                         the same items that are excluded from   
                                         comparable earnings measures for the   
                                         relevant periods as described   
                                         immediately above) and then adjusted   
                                         further for (1) interest expense, (2)   
                                         income taxes, (3) depreciation, (4)   
                                         used vehicle sales results and (5)   
                                         intangible amortization. We believe   
                                         comparable EBITDA provides investors   
                                         with useful information, as it is a   
                                         standard measure commonly reported   
                                         and widely used by investors and   
                                         other interested parties to measure   
                                         financial performance and our ability   
                                         to service debt and meet our payment   
                                         obligations. We believe that the   
                                         inclusion of comparable EBITDA also   
                                         provides consistency in financial   
                                         reporting and aids investors in   
                                         performing meaningful comparisons of   
                                         past, present and future operating   
                                         results. Our presentation of   
                                         comparable EBITDA may not be   
                                         comparable to similarly-titled   
                                         measures used by other companies.   
                                         Comparable EBITDA should not be   
                                         considered a substitute for, or   
                                         superior to, the measures of   
                                         financial performance determined in   
                                         accordance with GAAP.

 Cash Flow Measures:   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
 Total Cash Generated                    We consider total cash generated and   
                                         free cash flow to be important   
  Free Cash Flow                         measures of comparative operating   
                                         performance, as our principal sources   
                                         of operating liquidity are cash from   
                                         operations and proceeds from the sale   
                                         of revenue earning equipment. Total   
                                         Cash Generated is defined as the sum   
                                         of (1) net cash provided by operating   
                                         activities, (2) net cash provided by   
                                         the sale of revenue earning   
                                         equipment, (3) net cash provided by   
                                         the sale of operating property and   
                                         equipment and (4) other cash inflows   
                                         from investing activities. We believe   
                                         total cash generated is an important   
                                         measure of total cash flows generated   
                                         from our ongoing business activities.   
                                         Free Cash Flow is defined as the net   
                                         amount of cash generated from   
                                         operating activities and investing   
                                         activities (excluding acquisitions)   
                                         from continuing operations. We   
                                         calculate free cash flow as the sum   
                                         of (1) net cash provided by operating   
                                         activities, (2) net cash provided by   
                                         the sale of revenue earning equipment   
                                         and operating property and equipment,   
                                         and (3) other cash inflows from   
                                         investing activities, less (4)   
                                         purchases of property and revenue   
                                         earning equipment. We believe free   
                                         cash flow provides investors with an   
                                         important perspective on the cash   
                                         available for debt service and for   
                                         shareholders, after making capital   
                                         investments required to support   
                                         ongoing business operations. Our   
                                         calculation of free cash flow may be   
                                         different from the calculation used   
                                         by other companies and, therefore,   
                                         comparability may be limited.
