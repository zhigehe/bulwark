The total value of building permits rose by 11.0% month-over-month to $13.1 billion in December 2024, way above market expectations of a 1.7% rise, following an 5.6% decrease in the previous month.

Residential permits were up by 21.2% to $9.0 billion, led by an increase in multiple-unit (33.3%) to $6.1 billion and single-unit (1.8%) to $2.9 billion.

Meanwhile, non-residential sector permits fell by 5.9% to $4.2 billion, primarily due to significant decreases in the commercial (-10.9%) and institutional (-11.2%) components, which more than offset a 13.9% increase in the industrial sector.

In contrast, the industrial component registered an increase of 13.9%.
