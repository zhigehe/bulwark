By Alí R. Bustamante

About the author: Alí R. Bustamante is director of the worker power and economic security program at the Roosevelt Institute.

After years of debate over inflation in the postpandemic economy, one fact is clear: The Federal Reserve's strategy is failing. The inflationary pressures that dominated headlines in 2021 and 2022 were driven by supply chain disruptions and shifting consumer demand. As those pressures eased, prices for goods stabilized, and some even declined. Yet, despite aggressive interest rate hikes, inflation remains stubbornly high.

The reason is simple. Today's inflation is overwhelmingly a housing problem, and the Fed has no tools to fix it. Shelter costs alone are keeping core inflation above 3%, largely because housing makes up 36.7% percent of the consumer price index. The latest data confirm this trend. Wednesday's update to CPI data showed shelter costs were 4.4% higher in January than they were a year ago.

Unlike previous inflationary surges that responded to supply-side interventions, housing inflation is the result of decades of underinvestment, restrictive zoning laws, and slow permitting processes. The Fed's policies do nothing to address these structural barriers. Worse, by keeping interest rates high, the Fed is actively discouraging new housing construction, worsening the crisis and ensuring inflation remains persistent.

The Fed's standard response to inflation is to raise interest rates to curb demand. But that assumes that inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods. That logic doesn't apply to housing, where demand is inelastic and supply is the real constraint. People will always need shelter, and higher mortgage rates do little to suppress rental demand. Instead, high borrowing costs make it more expensive for developers to finance new housing projects, which exacerbates shortages and pushes rents even higher. This creates a vicious cycle: The Fed keeps rates high to slow inflation, but inflation remains elevated because there simply isn't enough housing.

The only way to address this problem is through direct, pro-supply housing policies at the federal, state, and local levels. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, though not without limitations, has financed millions of affordable housing units since the 1980s, spurring development by incentivizing private-sector investment and directly targeting supply. Yet, these are the types of federal programs currently at risk of losing funding. They were cut under the first Trump administration.

The federal government can complement housing incentives by addressing the market concentration and anticompetitive behavior contributing to rising rents. Large corporate landlords and real estate investment trusts have increasingly consolidated rental markets, allowing a few dominant players to exert outsize control over pricing. Antitrust regulators must investigate price-setting practices in regions where a handful of landlords dominate. Breaking up anticompetitive behavior in rental markets would allow for more fair pricing and reduce rent inflation. Yet, it is unclear whether the new administration's Federal Trade Commission leadership will do this.

In the absence of federal policy support, state and local governments can implement to allow for denser housing development in high-demand urban and suburban areas. In Minneapolis, eliminating single-family zoning in 2018 led to an increase in multiunit housing construction, which helped moderate rent growth. Oregon's statewide legalization of duplexes and fourplexes in single-family zones has expanded the supply of smaller, more affordable housing options. California has enacted new laws making it easier to build accessory dwelling units and mid-density housing near transit hubs, demonstrating how policy changes can promote higher-density development without drastically altering neighborhood character. New York City has also introduced innovative policies, such as the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which requires developers to set aside a percentage of units in new buildings for affordable housing in exchange for zoning benefits. While challenges remain, these initiatives show that local governments can play a critical role in shaping a more affordable housing market.

The Fed will keep interest rates elevated as long as inflation remains high. Higher rates will slow economic growth and discourage investment. But as long as housing costs drive inflation, the Fed's approach will continue to fail.

The real solution is clear. The country needs a coordinated, large-scale effort to increase housing supply. Without federal intervention to push local and state governments toward pro-supply policies, Americans will remain stuck with high housing costs, high interest rates, and a sluggish economy.

The Fed cannot fix this problem. Only housing policy can.
