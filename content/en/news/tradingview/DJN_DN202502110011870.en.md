By Dominic Chopping

* Michelin is considering accelerating U.S. investments to counter the threat of tariffs, Financial Times reports, citing Chief Executive Florent Menegaux.
* The French tiremaker has 35 factories across North America, but said it can't guarantee that 100% of all the products, all the components and all the materials it uses there are produced locally, according to FT.
* Michelin won't rush into decisions or drastically change strategy, but accelerated investments in its U.S. factories could mean that it slows down projects elsewhere, FT reports.
* CEO Menegaux said that exporting from Europe is no longer economical, FT says.
