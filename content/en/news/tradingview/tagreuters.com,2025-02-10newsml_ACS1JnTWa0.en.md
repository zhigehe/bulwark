SEOUL, KOREA / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / Global Interactive Technologies, Inc. (the "Company"), a media-tech company and creator of FANTOO, an all-in-one social media experience connecting k-culture fans globally, today announced that on February 10, 2025, the Company received a notification letter from the staff at the Listing Qualifications Department (the "Staff") of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq"), confirming that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Rule").

To regain compliance with the Rule, the Company's common stock was required to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 or more for at least 10 consecutive business days by February 3, 2025. As the minimum bid price of the Company's common stock has remained above $1.00 per share from January 27, 2025, through February 7, 2025, the Staff considers the prior bid price deficiency matter now closed, and the Company has regained compliance.

The Company's common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq.
