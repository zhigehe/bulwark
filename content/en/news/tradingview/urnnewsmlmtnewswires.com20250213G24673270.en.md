Relx said Thursday its net profit and revenue for the full year 2024 increased year over year.

Net profit attributable to shareholders for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 1.93 billion pounds sterling, compared with 1.79 billion pounds earlier. EPS moved to 1.031 pounds from 0.936 pound.

The British information analytics company's revenue was 9.43 billion pounds, compared with 9.16 billion pounds a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 9.55 billion pounds in sales, 2.27 billion pounds in net income, and 1.21 pounds in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board proposed a final dividend of 0.448 pound per share for the second half, payable June 19 to shareholders on record May 9. It paid 0.418 pound per share a year ago. This takes the full-year dividend to 0.630 pound per share, up from 0.588 pound in the previous year.

For the full year 2025, the company expects strong growth in underlying revenue, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted EPS, on a constant currency basis.
