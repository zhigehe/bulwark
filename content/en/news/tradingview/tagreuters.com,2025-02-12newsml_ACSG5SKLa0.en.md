CHARLOTTE, NC / ACCESS Newswire / February 12, 2025 / Air T, Inc. is an industrious American company with a portfolio of businesses, each of which is independent yet interrelated. We seek dynamic individuals and teams to operate companies with processes and insights that drive increasing value over time. We believe we can invest corporate resources to help activate growth and overcome challenges.

Our core segments are overnight air cargo; ground equipment sales; commercial jet engines and parts; and corporate and other.

The company is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its business unit, Contrail, a leading provider of commercial aircraft trading, leasing, and parts solutions and a key contributor to Air T's long-term growth.

Today the Company is announcing results for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024:

* Revenues totaled $77.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $14.1 million, or 22% from the prior year's comparable quarter.
* Operating income was $1.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter's operating loss of $1.6 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA\* profit of $2.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA\* loss of $0.1 million in the prior year's comparable quarter.
* The investment balance for the Company's equity method investees was $18.7 million at December 31, 2024; as compared to $16.7 million at March 31, 2024.

\*Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure; see below for further explanation and reconciliation to GAAP measure.

**Company Chairman and CEO Nick Swenson commented:**

"Fiscal 2025 themes continue. Aviation assets are rising in value creating near-term challenges for our customers and ourselves, while requiring careful calibration of future expectations. Our independent-yet-interrelated businesses in the mid-to-end-of-life aviation asset marketplaces are making adjustments to adapt. Notably, Contrail has deleveraged significantly in the past year; and Crestone has both sold aviation assets and added net assets to the portfolio they manage for investment partners. Amidst a challenging sales and margin environment, GGS is working hard on a large number of product-development projects. We don't believe that we have lost significant market share but rather deicer sales have been weak for all participants. We're hopeful that this will reverse in the next year. Finally, we expect continued steady growth in our digital revenues. Our investor presentation includes more information with respect to digital revenues."

**Business Segment Results**

Overnight Air Cargo

* This segment provides air express delivery services, primarily for FedEx, and repair services.
* Revenues for this segment increased 5% to $30.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to $29.0 million in the prior year's comparable quarter. The increase was principally attributable to higher administrative fees and pass through revenue due to an increased fleet of 105 aircraft as of December 31, 2024 compared to 85 aircraft as of December 31, 2023.
* Adjusted EBITDA\* for this segment was $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.1 million when compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.

Ground Equipment Sales ("GGS")

* This segment-which includes some of the world-leading brands in the category-manufactures mobile deicers and other specialized ground-support equipment. Customers include passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military, and other industrial customers.
* Revenues for this segment totaled $11.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, up 40% when compared to revenue of $8.4 million in the previous year's third fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the higher number of deicing trucks sold and higher parts and service revenue in the current year's quarter compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.
* Adjusted EBITDA\* profit for this segment was $0.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.7 million compared to the prior year quarter's Adjusted EBITDA\* loss of $0.5 million, due primarily to the revenue increase noted above.
* As of December 31, 2024, this segment's order backlog was $12.9 million versus $6.2 million as of December 31, 2023.

Commercial Jet Engines and Parts

* This segment leases commercial jet engines and aircraft; buys, sells and trades in surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engines, engine parts, airframes, and airframe parts, avionics, and other; then delivers the related documents and logistics.
* Revenues for this segment totaled $32.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $8.5 million versus the previous year's fiscal third quarter. This increase was largely attributed to higher component sales at Contrail during the current quarter. We believe this growth is due to airlines prioritizing the maintenance of their existing 737NG and A320CEO fleets as a result of cancellations or delays in new aircraft deliveries from OEMs. Contrail has been able to meet this rising demand by leveraging its inventory and expertise in providing serviceable aftermarket materials.
* Adjusted EBITDA\* profit for this segment was $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.1 million when compared to the prior year quarter's Adjusted EBITDA\* loss of $0.2 million, primarily due to the revenue increase noted above.

Corporate and Other

* This segment reflects the Company's activities as a capital allocator and resource for its consolidated businesses. Moreover, Corporate and Other segment also comprises activity related to its smaller businesses and business interests.
* Revenues for this segment totaled $2.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.6 million versus the previous year's fiscal third quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to increased software subscriptions at Shanwick driven by its growing customer base.
* This segment's Adjusted EBITDA\* for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, represented a loss of $2.5 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.1 million when compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA\* loss was primarily driven by higher health insurance claims.

Contrail Celebrates 25 Years of Excellence in Commercial Aircraft Trading & Leasing

Acquired by Air T in July 2016, Contrail has been a key player in commercial aircraft trading, leasing, and parts solutions since its founding in 2000.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

The Company uses adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company's financial performance. This performance measure is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's performance because it provides investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace or be an alternative to operating income, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

The table below provides a reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):

|  | Three months ended | | | | | |  | Nine months ended | | | | | |  |
