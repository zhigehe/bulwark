GSK , Pfizer and Shionogi-owned ViiV Healthcare said Thursday it concluded negotiations with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance for Apretude, a long-acting injectable aimed at preventing HIV-1 infection in at-risk individuals.

The agreement is expected to support broader public access to Apretude, reinforcing Canada's goal of ending HIV by 2030, the company said.

Apretude is approved in Canada as the only long-acting injectable for pre-exposure prophylaxis in HIV-negative adults and adolescents aged 12 or older who weigh at least 35 kg, it added.

ViiV Healthcare plans to work closely with provincial and territorial governments, as well as other stakeholders, to expedite public reimbursement and availability of the treatment, according to the company.
