\*\* Shares in Adyen are up 11.3%, highest since August 19, 2022, after the Dutch payments company reported higher than expected net revenues in the second half of 2024 and forecast margin expansion in 2025

\*\* Adyen's net revenues in the six months to December were up 22% to 1.08 billion euros, leading to full-year core earnings of 992.3 million euros ($1.04 billions), which beat the 974.7 million euros expected on average by 29 analysts polled by LSEG

\*\* This is a "solid print", Stifel says, citing a volume growth acceleration across the board on an underlying basis

\*\* Up to the previous session's close, shares were up 9.8%​ YTD

\*\* Peers Worldline and Nexi are up 5% and 3.8% respectively

($1 = 0.9587 euros)
