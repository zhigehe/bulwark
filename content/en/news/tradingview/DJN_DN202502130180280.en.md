Kakao's 2025 earnings could be pressured by slower-than-expected recovery in its targeted advertising and e-commerce markets and higher-than-expected costs for artificial intelligence-related services, Daiwa Capital analysts Thomas Y. Kwon and Joon Lee write in a note. They lower their 2025 EPS forecast for the South Korean mobile internet company by 16%. Still, they positively note Kakao's planned new AI services for users in 1H and potentially strong growth momentum in user traffic, advertisement revenue and operating profit from 2H. Daiwa cuts its target price for the stock by 2.8% to KRW54,800 but keeps a buy rating. Shares are 0.6% lower at KRW39,950. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)
