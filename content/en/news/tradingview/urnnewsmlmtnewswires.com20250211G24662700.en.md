RBC Capital Markets on Tuesday reduced its earnings projections for UBS Group following lower personal and corporate banking, and noncore and legacy earnings in its fourth-quarter 2024 update.

Adjusted EPS estimates were lowered to $1.98 from $2.21 for 2025, and to $3.20 from $3.37 for 2026.

At the same time, the analysts maintained their price target of 36 francs and outperform rating on the stock, expecting cost savings to come through and revenues to recover.

Regarding the impact of potential changes to too-big-to-fail regulations on the Swiss bank's performance, RBC said, "We remain of the view that this is a near-term overhang with more clarity in the next months allowing UBS to reset and shift the focus towards the longer-term potential of the business."
