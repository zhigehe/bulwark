China has condemned US "smearing and sabotage" after Panama's exit from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), urging the country to reconsider for the sake of bilateral ties, Reuters reported Feb. 7.

China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed deep regret for Panama's decision, accusing Washington of pressuring Panama into the move, according to the report.

Panama submitted its withdrawal after a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, although its president, Jose Raul Mulino, denied US influence, Reuters wrote. Panama initially joined BRI in November 2017, just five months after switching diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan.
