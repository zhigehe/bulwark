Newcastle coal futures fell to $105 per tonne in February, extending its recent plunge to the lowest in over four years amid an increasingly oversupplied market.

China announced that its output is set to expand 1.5% to 4.82 billion tons in 2025 following a record-setting 2024, aiming to expand mining capacity to avoid availability risks from carbon emission limits and mine shutdowns for safety protocol breaches.

The development occurred as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, which rose by 12% in the two months ending October.

Also, Indonesian output rose to a record high 836 million tonnes in 2024, 18% above its target, while the country’s increasing investment in alternative power sources, including solar and biofuels, limited the outlook for domestic coal demand.

On the trade front, China implemented tariffs on US coal imports, which do not make up a significant portion of Chinese sourcing, but levies on LNG pressure alternative power feedstock.
