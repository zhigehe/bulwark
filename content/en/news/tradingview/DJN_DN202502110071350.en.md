European natural-gas prices could surge above 70 euros a megawatt hour if the U.S. further extends sanctions on Russian liquefied natural-gas plants, according to analysts at Rabobank. LNG imports accounted for 40% of Europe's supply mix so far this year, with at least 16% of it coming from Russia. "Tighter sanctions on Russian gas/LNG account for the biggest risk premium for European markets," the analysts say. "The promise of higher U.S. LNG deliveries will not change this outlook as these volumes can only change balances after 2026/2027." On the other hand, a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could enable the restart of some pipeline flows, with an estimated 15-20 billion cubic meters a year flowing to European markets, Rabobank says.
