The U.S.'s plan to impose new restrictions on exports of key technologies used in artificial intelligence to foreign countries is counterproductive, says Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission's top tech regulator. "We will use all diplomatic means to request that the U.S. would treat the EU in a non-discriminatory way," she says, adding that lifting the restrictions would benefit both the EU and U.S. and calling the EU "the best customer of the U.S. for tech exports." The U.S. floated its AI chip export restrictions — which could lead to many EU member states having the number they can buy capped — last month in an effort to safeguard against national security risks.
