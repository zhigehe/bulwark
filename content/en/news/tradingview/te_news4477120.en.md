Gold prices hovered near a record high above $2,900 per ounce on Thursday, as investors continued to sought safe-haven assets amid rising trade tensions and economic uncertainty.

The White House announced Wednesday that President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be unveiled as soon as Thursday, following his decision earlier in the week to impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.

This move builds on existing tariffs, which include 10% on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, though the latter are currently on hold.

Meanwhile, US inflation data showed persistent inflationary trends, with all key metrics exceeding expectations.

This has strengthened the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts, as it recently signaled no urgency for further reductions, denting the appeal of non-yielding gold.
