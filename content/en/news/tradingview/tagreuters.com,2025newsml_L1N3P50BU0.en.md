Feb 14 (Reuters) - UK inflation data for January, due next week, should cement the consensus expectation for the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged next month.

CPI is forecast to rise to 2.7% YY, from 2.5% in December, according to a Reuters poll. A 2.7% print would be the highest since March 2024. The data will be released on Wednesday (Feb. 19), at 0700 GMT.

The BoE last week forecast that UK CPI will rise to a high of 3.7% later this year - nearly double the BoE's 2% target.

BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill this week told Reuters that the BoE needs to move cautiously with cutting rates because the long process of wrestling down inflation is not yet complete.

Markets currently see an 81% chance of the BoE keeping rates at 4.5% on March 20, and an 82% chance of a 25 basis point cut in May. (0#GBPIRPR)
