Major earnings reports and a brewing initial public offering dominated headlines in the United Arab Emirates, with the busy Thursday session closing with the FTSE ADX General Index flat at 0.003% in the red and the DFM General Index up 0.283%.

In Dubai, delivery services company Talabat (DFM:TALABAT) added 4.08% on the back of its full-year 2024 earnings report. The company, which listed in December 2024 after a record IPO that raised $2 billion, said its revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded its guidance, sending its net income 64% higher year over year.

"We are also particularly proud of our successful IPO as the first technology listing on the Dubai Financial Market and the largest technology IPO in 2024 globally. Looking ahead to 2025, we are confident in our reiterated guidance and our ability to continue driving sustainable growth and profitability," Talabat Chief Executive Tomaso Rodriguez said.

Parkin Co. (DFM:PARKIN), Adnoc Drilling (ADX:ADNOCDRILL), and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (ADX:TAQA), d/b/a Taqa, are also some of the notable companies that reported their results.

Meanwhile, Alpha Data said it plans to list on the Abu Dhabi bourse and offer 400 million shares, or 40% of its share capital, worth 30 million Emirati dirhams. The IT services company is planning to pay out 130 million dirhams in dividends in 2025. The subscription period for the offering ends Feb. 25.

In other news, market watchers are awaiting updates on reciprocal tariffs from the US. Reuters reported that executive orders are expected to be signed Thursday.
