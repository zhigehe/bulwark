American Rebel Holdings Inc. (AREB) filed a Form 8K - Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2025.

As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 27, 2024, on November 22, 2024, the Company received a notice (the "Notice") from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") indicating that, as a result of not having timely filed the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, which require timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until January 21, 2025 to submit a plan to regain compliance. The Company submitted a plan before such date and subsequently filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 on February 7, 2025.

On February 10, 2025, the Company received a written notification from the Staff indicating that the Company had regained compliance with the periodic filing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rules.
