The DAX regained some ground to close about 0.5% up at 22,143 on Wednesday, reaching a new record high and extending gains for the third session.

Investors analyzed fresh corporate earnings while digesting the latest US inflation data and Fed Chair Powell’s cautious remarks.

Siemens Energy AG led the index, climbing nearly 5% after reporting a 17% revenue increase in Q1 2025 across all segments, despite a sharp drop in net profit to €252 million from €1.58 billion a year earlier.
