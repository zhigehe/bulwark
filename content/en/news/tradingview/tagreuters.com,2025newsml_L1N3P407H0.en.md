European chemicals maker DSM-Firmenich said on Thursday it expected an adjusted core profit of at least 2.4 billion euro ($2.50 billion) in 2025, after it reported annual results slightly above market expectations.

The group, born out of a 2023 merger of Netherlands-based DSM and Switzerland-based Firmenich, said it intended to launch a share buyback in the second quarter of 2025 for an initial amount of 500 million euros, which would later be increased to up to 1 billion euros.

Its adjusted core profit was 2.12 billion euros in 2024, just ahead of analysts' forecast of 2.11 billion euros in a consensus compiled by Vara Research.

"We delivered strongly improved financial results in all our businesses, benefitting from better business conditions," CEO Dimitri de Vreeze said in a statement.

The company posted a 4% annual increase in net sales to 12.80 billion euros.

The results were supported by a 200 million euro adjusted core profit contribution from merger synergies and a transformation program of its vitamin activities, de Vreeze said.

DSM-Firmenich expects this combined contribution to be at a similar level in 2025.

It had launched the vitamin restructuring program in mid-2023 to reduce costs and restore profitability of the business.

The company proposed a dividend of 2.50 euro per share for the year, the same amount it had paid out in 2024.
