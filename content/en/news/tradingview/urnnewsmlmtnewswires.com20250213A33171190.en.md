US benchmark equity indexes were higher intraday as markets analyzed the latest batch of corporate earnings and economic data.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7% at 19,788.8 after midday Thursday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 6,080. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.3% to 44,501. Among sectors, materials and technology led the gainers, while utilities saw the biggest drop.

In company news, MGM Resorts International shares jumped nearly 18%, the top gainer on the S&P 500. The company late Wednesday posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that fell less than projected.

AppLovin shares were up 20% intraday Thursday, the second-best Nasdaq performer. The company delivered a fourth-quarter beat late Wednesday.

West Pharmaceutical Services was the worst performer on the S&P 500 intraday Thursday, down 36%, after issuing a downbeat full-year outlook.

Trade Desk shares sank 33%, the steepest decline on the Nasdaq. The company late Wednesday logged fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street's views.

Applied Materials , Palo Alto Networks and Airbnb are among the companies scheduled to report results after Thursday's closing bell.

The US 10-year yield was down 9.7 basis points at 4.54% intraday, while the two-year rate lost 5.2 basis points to 4.31%.

In economic news, US producer price growth rose more than the Street's expectations last month as wholesale costs of goods increased amid a jump in diesel fuel, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.

"A hotter-than-expected producer price report on the heels of yesterday's rise in the (consumer price index) report reinforces concerns of ingrained inflationary pressures in the economy and further upside price risks given an aggressive fiscal policy agenda," Stifel said. "As such, hopes of further policy relief from the (Federal Reserve) is off the table, at least for now, or until inflation stabilizes and/or the labor market shows meaningful signs of cooling."

On Tuesday, Powell said the Fed does "not need to be in a hurry" to adjust monetary policy as the economy remained strong.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil was little changed at $71.39 a barrel intraday.

Gold rose 0.6% to $2,947.10 per troy ounce, while silver was little changed at $32.8 per ounce.
