Finnish forestry group Stora Enso said on Tuesday its fourth quarter operating profit more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by price increases and cost saving actions, though it slightly missed market expectations.

Adjusted operating profit rose to 121 million euros ($124.7 million) in the October-December quarter from 51 million euros in the same period in 2023. That was just below the 122.4 million euros expected by analysts polled by Vara Research.

Last October, Stora Enso put some of its Swedish forest assets up for sale to reduce debt.

The company said in a statement on Tuesday that the sales process was ongoing, with a fair value of 6.3 billion euros.

($1 = 0.9702 euros)
