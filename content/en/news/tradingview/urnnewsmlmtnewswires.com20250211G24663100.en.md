The European Commission will mobilize 200 billion euros for artificial intelligence investments, President Ursula von der Leyen said at the AI Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday.

The InvestAI initiative includes a new 20 billion-euro fund for AI gigafactories, providing the infrastructure needed to develop complex, large-scale AI models for critical domains such as medicine and science.

The initiative is part of the commission's wider AI innovation package, which also includes funding for generative AI research.
