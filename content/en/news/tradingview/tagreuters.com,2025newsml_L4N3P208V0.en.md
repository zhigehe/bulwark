Indian government bond yields dipped in early deals on Tuesday, as sentiment got a boost after the central bank doubled the quantum of its scheduled debt purchase for the week.

The benchmark 10-year yield (IN067934G=CC) was at 6.6859% as of 10:00 a.m. IST, compared with the previous close of 6.7128%.

"The announcement is a strong support for the bond market, as traders were looking for any dovish trigger after disappointing monetary policy announcement," a trader with a state-run bank said.

However, rising oil and U.S. yields may have been limiting further decline in local yields, the trader said.

The Reserve Bank of India, after market hours on Monday, said it would double the quantum of security purchases under its next tranche of open market operation on February 13 to 400 billion rupees ($4.61 billion) without altering the securities that it has chosen to buy.

The RBI is scheduled to buy bonds worth another 200 billion rupees on February 20, with the market eyeing a similar addition to the quantum in the coming days.

The announcement came after the RBI cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Friday but did not signal any liquidity-infusing measure, which disappointed market participants and led to higher yields in the last two sessions.

The rise in the quantum of bond purchases expands the central bank's mega liquidity infusion plan, which has been in place since the last three weeks.

The RBI has bought bonds worth 200.20 billion rupees through OMO auction, infused 500 billion rupees through a 56-day variable rate repo and around 440 billion rupees through a dollar/rupee swap.

In January, the RBI also bought bonds worth 388.15 billion rupees through the secondary market, taking its overall infusion into the banking system to more than 1.50 trillion rupees in the last one month.
