STOCKS:

The benchmark BSE Sensex was down 0.04% at 76,138.97, while the broader NSE Nifty 50 index declined 0.06% to 23,031.40, hit by mounting concerns over the United States imposing new tariffs and prospects of fewer rate cuts in the world's largest economy.

RUPEE:

The Indian rupee was little changed at 86.90 per U.S. dollar, wedged between gains in regional peers and importers' dollar demand.

GOVERNMENT BONDS:

The benchmark 10-year bond (IN071034G=CC) was quoted at 100.5475 rupees, with the yield marginally higher at 6.7103%, as a spike in U.S. yields and a fresh supply of debt offset optimism from the central bank's large-scale debt purchases.

OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAPS:

The one-year overnight index swap rate (INR1YMIBROIS=CC) was down 3 basis points at 6.325%, while the five-year swap rate (INR5YMIBROIS=CC) 1 bp to 6.135%.

CALL MONEY:

India's overnight call money rate (INROND=) was at 5.80% and the overnight TREPS rate (INTREPTOT=TCCL) was at 6.44%
