By Jonathan Clegg

We're witnessing an epic beatdown in the Super Bowl, but it's not yet a historic one.

The Eagles entered the fourth quarter with a 34-6 lead, putting them on course for the largest winning margin since the Seattle Seahawks beat the Denver Broncos 43-8 in 2014. That ranks as the fourth-most lopsided Super Bowl ever, behind the 49ers' 55-10 rout of the Broncos in 1990, the Bears' 46-10 thumping of the New England Patriots in 1986 and the Dallas Cowboys' 52-17 walloping of the Buffalo Bills in 1993.
