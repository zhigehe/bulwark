Sigma Healthcare received from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) the relief and from the Australian Securities Exchange the confirmations allowing it to meet its financial reporting obligations in the future, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

Sigma and Chemist Warehouse, which it recently acquired, have different balance dates. Sigma's financial year ends on Jan. 31, while Chemist Warehouse's financial year ends on June 30.

The relief granted by ASIC will allow the post-merger entity to report in accordance with Chemist Warehouse's financial year.

Consequently, Sigma will release financial results for the financial year ending June 30 and half-year financial results for the half-year ending Dec. 31. It will still prepare its financial statements and an annual report for its statutory financial year ended Jan. 31 on a standalone basis without the consolidation of Chemist Warehouse and its controlled entities, which it expects to release in March.

The firm's shares rose nearly 5% in recent trading on Friday.
