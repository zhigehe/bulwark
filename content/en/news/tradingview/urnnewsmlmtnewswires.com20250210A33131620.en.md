T-Mobile US said Sunday it has launched its satellite-powered T-Mobile Starlink service in beta mode.

The service is a collaboration between T-Mobile and SpaceX's Starlink. It uses satellite and mobile communications technology to maintain connectivity across areas not covered by cell phone towers, the company said.

For now, the service only allows for text messages on most smartphones made within the last four years, with pictures, data and voice coming later, the company said.

The beta service will remain free until July, when it will be included in T-Mobile's top plan and available for $15 per month on other T-Mobile plans and $20 per month for Verizon and AT&T customers, the company said.
