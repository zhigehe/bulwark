The offshore yuan strengthened around 7.30 per dollar, as investors weighed the impact of growing global trade tensions.

The White House signaled that President Trump’s new tariffs could be announced as early as Thursday, building on the existing 10% levy on Chinese goods and 25% duties on steel and aluminum.

However, Trump revealed in a recent interview that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, highlighting their "very good personal relationship," which could help ease or delay ongoing trade tariffs.

Additionally, optimism grew over a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia following phone talks between US President Trump, Russian President Putin, and Ukrainian leader Zelenskiy .Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are considering a 50 billion yuan aid package for China Vanke, one of the country’s largest developers, to support the struggling property sector.

While the plan has boosted investor confidence in property stocks, it raises concerns about long-term debt risks.
