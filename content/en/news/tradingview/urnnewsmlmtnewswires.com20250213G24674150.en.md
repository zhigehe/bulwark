DSM-Firmenich said Thursday it plans to launch a share buyback program of up to 1 billion euros to decrease its issued capital.

The chemicals company will start buying back up to 500 million euros of its shares in the second quarter before upsizing it to 1 billion euros after it closes its Feed Enzymes Alliance stake purchase.

DSM-Firmenich will repurchase shares until the second quarter of 2026.
