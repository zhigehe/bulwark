SMITH A O CORP, a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers, has released its 2024Â 10-K report, detailing the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's activities and future outlook, reflecting its position in the highly competitive water heating and treatment industry.

**Financial Highlights**

**Net Sales:** $3,818.1 million, a decrease of $34.7 million compared to 2023, primarily driven by lower water heater volumes in North America and lower sales in China.

**Gross Profit:** $1,456.1 million, with a gross profit margin of 38.1%, slightly down from 38.5% in 2023 due to higher production costs and operational inefficiencies.

**Earnings Before Provision for Income Taxes:** $701.0 million, reflecting a decrease from $733.5 million in 2023, influenced by lower water heater volumes and higher SG&A expenses.

**Net Earnings:** $533.6 million, a decrease from $556.6 million in 2023, impacted by restructuring and impairment expenses and higher employee costs.

**Diluted Net Earnings Per Share:** $3.63, compared to $3.69 in 2023, reflecting the overall decrease in net earnings.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments:** The North America segment's major product lines include water heaters and related parts, boilers and related parts, and water treatment products. The Rest of World segment primarily includes sales from China and other regions.

**Geographical Performance:** In 2024, the North America segment accounted for approximately 77% of total sales, with the Rest of World segment, primarily China, accounting for 23%. Sales in China declined by 6% due to weakening consumer demand.

**Sales Units:** The North America segment experienced soft residential and commercial water heater order demand in the second half of 2024, with residential industry unit volumes flat compared to the prior year.

**New Product Launches:** The company launched the ADAPT condensing gas tankless water heater and the VERITUS air source commercial heat pump water heater in North America to align with greenhouse gas emission reduction trends.

**New Production Launches:** The company is expanding its commercial water heater capacity in North America in preparation for new efficiency rules for commercial water heaters that will take effect in 2026.

**Future Outlook:** The company expects consolidated sales to be approximately flat to up two percent in 2025 compared to 2024, with flat industry residential and commercial volumes anticipated. The Rest of World segment, particularly in China, is expected to see continued consumer demand softness.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Acquisitions:** In 2024, the company acquired Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia, for approximately $125 million, and Impact Water Products, a water treatment company, to expand its geographic presence and core business capabilities.

**Capacity Expansion:** The company is expanding its commercial water heater capacity in North America in preparation for new efficiency regulations.

**Product and Technology Focus:** The company is focusing on introducing new products and technologies, such as gas tankless water heaters in North America and connected product technologies in China.

**Capital Management:** The company renewed and amended its $500 million revolving credit facility, extending its expiration to August 2029, with an option to increase it to $1 billion. In 2024, the company repurchased 3,755,337 shares of its stock at a total cost of $305.8 million and increased its dividend by six percent. The company also repatriated approximately $90 million from foreign subsidiaries to pay down debt and fund acquisitions. Total debt increased by $65.9 million due to share repurchases and acquisitions.

**Future Outlook:** For 2025, the company expects consolidated sales to be flat to up two percent compared to 2024, with earnings projected between $3.60 and $3.90 per share. The company plans to repurchase approximately $400 million of its common stock and anticipates capital expenditures between $90 million and $100 million. The company aims to maintain a North America segment margin of approximately 24.0 to 24.5 percent and a Rest of World segment margin of eight to nine percent.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Market Competition:** The company operates in highly competitive markets, which could impact its revenues and earnings. The North America segment faces competition from major players like Rheem and Bradford White, while the Rest of World segment, particularly in China, competes with Haier/Casarte and Midea/COLMO.

**Economic and Industry Risks:** The company is vulnerable to global economic conditions, which could affect consumer confidence and spending patterns, leading to decreased demand for its products. Import tariffs and trade regulations could increase raw material costs, impacting profitability. Extraordinary events like natural disasters and political disruptions could disrupt operations and supply chains.

**Operational Risks:** The company relies on a limited number of suppliers for key materials, and any disruption could affect production. Changes in consumer behavior and preferences, particularly in China, could impact sales. The company's international operations expose it to risks related to foreign currencies and geopolitical tensions.

**Regulatory Risks:** Changes in regulations, especially those related to climate change and energy efficiency, could increase costs and affect product demand. The company is also subject to laws governing international relations, which could result in penalties if violated.

**Management Strategies:** The company is focusing on strategic investments and cost structure improvements to mitigate these challenges. It uses forward contracts to hedge against currency risks, but significant movements in exchange rates could still affect financial results.
