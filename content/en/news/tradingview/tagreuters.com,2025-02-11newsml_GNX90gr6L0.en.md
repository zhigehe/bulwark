VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Aritzia Inc. ("**Aritzia**" or the "**Company**") , a design house with an innovative global platform offering Everyday Luxury online and in its boutiques, today announced that Brian Hill, Founder and Executive Chair of Aritzia , together with certain entities owned and/or controlled, directly or indirectly, by him, or him and his immediate family (collectively, the “**Selling Shareholders**”), have entered into an agreement with CIBC Capital Markets (the “**Underwriter**”), pursuant to which the Underwriter has agreed to purchase on a bought deal basis an aggregate of 950,000 subordinate voting shares of the Company (“**Shares**”) held by the Selling Shareholders at an offering price of $69.85 per Share (the “**Offering Price**”) for total gross proceeds to the Selling Shareholders of $66,357,500 (the “**Offering**”). Proceeds from the Offering will be paid to the Selling Shareholders and the Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offering. The Selling Shareholders have granted the Underwriter an over-allotment option, exercisable at the Offering Price for a period of 30 days following the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an additional 95,000 Shares to cover over-allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes.

Following the Offering, Mr. Hill will remain the Company’s largest shareholder with an approximately 17.3% equity interest. The proceeds from the Offering are intended for estate planning, investment diversification and charitable giving purposes (including through the ARON Charitable Foundation, the Hill family’s charitable foundation).

Pursuant to the Offering, the Selling Shareholders will be selling a total of 950,000 Shares (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option). Following completion of the Offering (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option), there will be 94,531,671 subordinate voting shares outstanding and 19,774,244 multiple voting shares outstanding of the Company.

The Shares will be offered by way of a short form prospectus in all of the provinces and territories of Canada, excluding Quebec, and may also be offered by way of private placement in the United States and internationally as permitted. A preliminary short form prospectus relating to the Offering will be filed by no later than February 18, 2025 with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about February 28, 2025.

No securities regulatory authority has either approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release. The Shares have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “***U.S. Securities Act***”) or any state securities laws. Accordingly, the Shares may not be offered or sold within the United States unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

**Forward-Looking Information**

Certain statements made in this document may constitute forward-looking information under applicable securities laws. These statements may relate to the closing date of the Offering, the completion of the Offering, the exercise by the Underwriter of the over-allotment option, the Company’s future prospects and opportunities and potential future acquisitions or dispositions by the Hill Entities of securities of the Company.

Statements containing forward-looking information are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance, but instead, provide insights regarding management's current expectations and plans and allows investors and others to better understand the Company's anticipated business strategy, financial position, results of operations and operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Although the Company believes that the forward-looking statements are based on information, assumptions and beliefs that are current, reasonable, and complete, such information is necessarily subject to a number of business, economic, competitive and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations and plans as set forth in such forward-looking information. Forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to management and on estimates and assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action.

Given the current challenging operating environment, there can be no assurances regarding: (a) the macroeconomic impacts on Aritzia's business, operations, labour force, supply chain performance and growth strategies; (b) Aritzia's ability to mitigate such impacts, including ongoing measures to enhance short-term liquidity, contain costs and safeguard the business; (c) general economic conditions and impacts to consumer discretionary spending and shopping habits (including impacts from changes to interest rate environments); (d) credit, market, currency, commodity market, inflation, interest rates, global supply chains, operational, and liquidity risks generally; (e) geopolitical events including no unforeseen changes in applicable duties, tariffs and trade restrictions; (f) public health related limitations or restrictions that may be placed on servicing our clients or the duration of any such limitations or restrictions; and (g) other risks inherent to Aritzia's business and/or factors beyond its control which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Many factors could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the factors discussed in the "Risk Factors" section of our Management's Discussion & Analysis for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 dated January 9, 2025 (the "Q3 2025 MD&A"), for Fiscal 2024 dated May 2, 2024 (the "Fiscal 2024 MD&A") and the Company's annual information form for Fiscal 2024 dated May 2, 2024 (the "Fiscal 2024 AIF").

The Company cautions that the foregoing list of risk factors and uncertainties is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect its results. We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new risks often emerge. It is not possible for management to predict all risks, nor assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Readers are urged to consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions carefully in evaluating the forward-looking information and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information. The forward-looking information contained in this document represents our expectations as of the date of this document (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. We disclaim any intention, obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether written or oral, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities laws.
