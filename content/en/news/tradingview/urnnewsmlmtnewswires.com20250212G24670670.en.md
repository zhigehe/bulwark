Sumitomo Metal Mining's profit attributable to owners of the parent dropped more than 49% to 29.6 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024 from 58.3 yen billion a year ago.

The battery manufcaturer's earnings per share (EPS) fell to 107.77 yen from 212.28 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing on Wednesday.

Net sales increased 9.9% to 1.193 trillion yen from 1.085 trillion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company cut its earnings forecast due to the recording of an impairment loss in the third quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024 concerning its nickel smelting operations in the Philippines.

As such, it forecasted attributable profit to decline 47.1% to 31 billion yen or 112.79 yen per share (From 67 billion yen or 243.85 yen per share) and net sales to gain 8.8% to 1.57 trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31.

It expects to pay a year-end dividend of 55.00 yen per share, bringing the total to 104.00 per share for the fiscal year.
