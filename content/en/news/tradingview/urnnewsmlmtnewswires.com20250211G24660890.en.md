Macquarie Group's third-quarter earnings slowdown may hinder its ability to meet full-year guidance, according to a Tuesday report by the Australian Financial Review, citing investing and financial firm UBS.

UBS noted Macquarie's Q3 earnings were weaker than expected, with a cash net profit after tax (NPAT) of AU$9 million, flat year-on-year, following a strong first half, where Macquarie posted a 13.9% year-on-year increase in NPAT to AU$1.6 billion.

The investment firm now predicts that the MQG will need to achieve AU$1.2 billion in profit during the fourth quarter to meet its full-year cash profit forecast of AU$3.8 billion.

Despite the challenges, UBS said that Macquarie remains confident in its ability to hit this target.

Shares of MQG rose 2% at market close.
