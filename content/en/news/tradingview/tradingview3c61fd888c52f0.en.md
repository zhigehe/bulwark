American Electric Power (AEP) has released its fourth-quarter and year-end 2024 earnings results, showcasing significant growth and strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering its service and infrastructure. The company, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, operates the largest electric transmission system in the United States and serves 5.6 million customers across 11 states.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, AEP reported GAAP earnings of $664 million, or $1.25 per share, a substantial increase from $336 million, or $0.64 per share, in the same period of 2023. Operating earnings for the quarter were $660 million, or $1.24 per share, compared to $647 million, or $1.23 per share, in the previous year. Year-end 2024 GAAP earnings reached $2.97 billion, or $5.60 per share, up from $2.21 billion, or $4.26 per share, in 2023. Operating earnings for the year were $2.98 billion, or $5.62 per share, compared to $2.72 billion, or $5.25 per share, in 2023.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

AEP experienced a 10.6% growth in commercial load in 2024, driven by economic development in Indiana, Ohio, and Texas. The company anticipates an 8-9% annual total retail load growth from 2025-2027, expecting to serve more than 20 gigawatts of new load by the end of the decade. AEP's $54 billion five-year capital plan, announced in the fall, aims to build infrastructure to meet customer needs and support economic growth.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

AEP is evaluating $10 billion of potential incremental investment across its service territory and regional transmission grids. The company has filed for approval of 2.3 gigawatts of natural gas generation in PSO and SWEPCO and has active requests for proposals for new generation in Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, and PSO. Additionally, AEP announced an agreement with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to support data center customers.

**Management's Perspective**

Bill Fehrman, AEP president and CEO, emphasized the company's commitment to providing safe, reliable, and affordable power. He highlighted the significant load growth in the commercial class and the company's strategic investments to support this growth. Trevor Mihalik, AEP Executive Vice President and CFO, noted the financial flexibility gained from a $2.82 billion minority equity interest transaction, which supports economic growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

**Future Outlook**

AEP reaffirmed its 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share, with a long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% and an FFO/Debt target of 14% to 15%. The company is focused on advancing its capital plan, driving operational excellence, and delivering on commitments to stakeholders.
