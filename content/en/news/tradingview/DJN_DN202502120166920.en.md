JGBs fall in the morning Tokyo session, tracking overnight price declines in U.S. Treasurys. While the Bank of Japan is slated to buy a wide range of JGBs today, the operation's support to the Japanese government bond market could be limited by the sharp rise in U.S. long-dated yields, strategists at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities say. The 5-year JGB yield rises 2bps to 1.020%, its highest intraday level since October 2010; the 10-year yield rises 3bps to 1.370%, the highest intraday level since April 2010. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
