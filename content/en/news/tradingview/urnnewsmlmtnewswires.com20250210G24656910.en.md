The Chinese government introduced electricity pricing reforms Sunday, saying on-grid electricity prices from new energy sources will be determined by the market, Xinhua News Agency reported the same day.

On-grid electricity from new energy sources such as wind and solar power will enter the electricity market, the report said, citing the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration.

The previous fixed pricing regime "cannot fully reflect market supply and demand, nor does it share its due responsibility of power system regulation," the report said, citing both agencies.
