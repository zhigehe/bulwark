Parkson Retail forecasts it will swing to a loss of 175 million yuan in 2024 from a profit of 66.4 million yuan in 2023, according to a Thursday filing with the Hong Kong Exchange.

The loss is attributable to an 11% decline in total operating revenue driven by lower spending and a slower economic recovery, the filing said.

The retailer plans to release full-year results before the end of February.
