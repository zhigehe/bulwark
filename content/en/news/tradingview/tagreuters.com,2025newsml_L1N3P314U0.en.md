Arabica coffee futures trading on the ICE Exchange resumed their stellar rally on Wednesday though they remained below Tuesday's record intraday high, while Robusta coffee posted a fresh price peak.

COFFEE

\* Arabica coffee settled up 15.8 cents, or 3.9%, at $4.202 per lb. The contract climbed to an all-time high of $4.2995/lb for a 14th successive session early on Tuesday, before retreating sharply.

\* Broker and consultant Michael J Nugent said the real issue in coffee at the moment is capital availability rather than supply tightness.

\* "Monday's price action suggests a large Arabica trader hit a bank credit limit, triggering late-day liquidations and market chaos. The coffee market right now isn't about coffee — it's about money," he said.

\* A surge in the cost of trading Arabica coffee on the ICE Exchange has exacerbated the price rally, traders and industry analysts said, after the Exchange this week again announced it was raising Arabica margins or downpayments, which customers are required to pay to protect against trading losses.

\* Robusta coffee rose 2.8% at $5,821 a metric ton. It earlier rose to a peak of $5,847, the highest price since the current form of the contract started trading in 2008.

SUGAR

\* Raw sugar futures settled down 0.11 cent, or 0.6%, at 19.76 cents per lb, while white sugar rose 2.3% to $545.30 a ton, after hitting its highest since early December.

\* No. 2 sugar producer India has exported up to 500,000 metric tons of sugar so far this season, but the pace is slowing and it may struggle to fulfil the one million tons allowed by the government, trade and industry sources said.

\* Brazil's 2025/26 center-south sugar production is expected to increase 8.5% to 43.3 million metric tons, broker Hedgepoint has forecast.

\* Europe's largest sugar producer Suedzucker said it expected sugar prices in the European Union to improve considerably over the course of its 2025/26 financial year.

COCOA

\* New York cocoa futures settled down $171, or 1.7%, to $10,131 a ton, having ​settled up 4.3% on Tuesday, while London cocoa fell 0.8% to 8,099 pounds per ton.

\* Dealers said the market was supported by concerns about dry weather in top grower Ivory Coast, although stocks held in ICE warehouses in the U.S. (CC-TOTAL-TOT) have recovered of late, helping keep cocoa range-bound.
