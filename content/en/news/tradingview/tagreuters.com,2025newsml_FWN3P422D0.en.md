Sri Lanka's headline inflation is expected to peak around 2 percentage points above the central bank's target in the second quarter of 2026 due to an unfavourable base effect, a faster increase in global food inflation and demand pressures, the central bank said in its latest monetary policy report.

Sri Lanka's inflation, which peaked at 70% in September 2022, has tumbled to minus 4% in January mainly due to a 20% power tariff reduction. It is expected to accelerate and approach the central bank's 5% target in the third quarter of 2025 and rise further thereafter, the report said.

Taking advantage of the steep decline in inflation, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had slashed policy rates by 125 bps last year across three monetary policy reviews, bringing interest rates to pre-crisis levels.
