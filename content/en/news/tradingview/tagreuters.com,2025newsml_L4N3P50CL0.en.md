India's benchmark indexes opened higher on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said the Indian Prime Minister offered to talk about lowering tariffs, easing some worries over reciprocal duties.

The Nifty 50 was up 0.35% to 23,111.95 as of 9:18 a.m. IST, while the BSE Sensex gained 0.37% to 76,420.5.

Eleven of the 13 major sectors advanced. The broader, more domestically-focussed smallcaps and midcaps traded flat.

Indian PM Narendra Modi offered to talk about easing tariffs, buying more U.S. oil and gas, combat aircraft and concessions, Trump said on Thursday after he met Modi at the White House, setting the stage for trade negotiations.

Trump is devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, heightening the prospects of a global trade war.

However, Trump's tariffs will not be imposed right away.

Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick for commerce secretary, said the administration would address each affected country and studies on the issue would be completed by April 1.

Other Asian markets gained on relief that the reciprocal tariff plan will not be implemented immediately.
