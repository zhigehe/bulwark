The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 0.6% to below the 25,500 mark on Tuesday, pressured by declines in major mining equities and the financial sector, though gains in the energy sector helped limit the downturn.

Agnico Eagle, Barrick Gold, Wheaton Precious, and Franco-Nevada each lost over 0.8% as gold prices retreated from record highs, while key financial institutions such as RBC, Brookfield, and Manulife declined between 0.7% and 1.7%.

Additionally, e-commerce mega-cap Shopify dropped over 1% ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report due after the closing bell.

In contrast, energy producers including Suncor, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus added between 0.9% and 1.2%, tracking higher oil prices.

Meanwhile, investor caution prevailed after U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a flat 25% without exceptions, a measure designed to support domestic industries but one that risks sparking trade conflicts, with the new duties set to take effect on March.
