The yield on Italy’s 10-year BTP hovered around 3.45%, near its lowest level since December 18, as investors remained cautious over potential US tariffs and their impact on the global economy.

US President Donald Trump stated he would introduce tariffs this week to match those imposed by other countries, following Sunday’s announcement of a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports.

Meanwhile, recent data showing that Eurozone inflation remains within policymakers’ forecasts and that economic growth in Europe is sluggish further fueled expectations of additional interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank.
