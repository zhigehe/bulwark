Iron ore futures are higher in Asian trade. While fundamentals of the black metal are solid, market sentiment is weak due to a lack of strong demand, Nanhua Futures analysts write in a note. Analysts at Everbright Futures note that current inventory levels of iron ore remain high and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum from the U.S. are weighing on sentiment in the short term. Investors should keep an eye on geopolitical tensions and macro news, they say. The most-traded iron-ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is up 0.6% at CNY810.5/ton.(jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
