Gold prices dipped to $2,902 per ounce on Tuesday from a record $2,940 as investors took profits, though sentiment remained bullish amid trade tensions.

The decline was driven by short-term traders cashing in gains, with some expecting consolidation before the next move higher.

President Trump’s 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports fueled fears of a broader trade war, adding market uncertainty.

Investors now await Wednesday’s U.S. inflation data, which could shape Fed policy expectations.

While gold is a hedge against inflation, the Fed’s cautious stance on rate cuts may cap near-term gains.

However, ongoing geopolitical risks and potential new tariffs could keep gold supported.

Elsewhere, the BoE and RBI have recently implemented dovish rate cuts, mirroring similar actions by the ECB, Riksbank, and BoC. Additionally, sustained central bank demand supported gold, with the PBoC expanding its reserves for a third consecutive month in January.
