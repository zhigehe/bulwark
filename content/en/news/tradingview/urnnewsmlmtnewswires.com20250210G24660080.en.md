Retail sales in the UK gained 2.5% year over year on a like-for-like basis in January following a 3.1% jump in the previous month, according to data from the British Retail Consortium published Tuesday.

The reading beat the consensus estimate of a 0.2% increase.

The rise was primarily attributed to strong demand for discounted furniture, bedding, and home accessories.
