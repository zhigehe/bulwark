The University of Austin is making major moves in institutional Bitcoin adoption, planning to launch a dedicated Bitcoin investment fund.

This initiative reflects the increasing interest among US institutions to adopt Bitcoin and other digital assets.

**University Endowment Funds Increasingly Embrace Crypto**

Latest reports reveal that the University of Austin, established just a year ago, is raising a $5 million Bitcoin fund as part of its $200 million endowment. This move positions it as the first institution in the US to introduce a dedicated crypto endowment fund.

Chad Thevenot, the university’s senior vice president for advancement, stated that the Bitcoin holdings will remain untouched for at least five years. He likened Bitcoin’s long-term value to traditional investment assets such as real estate and equities.

“We think there is long-term value there, just the same way that we might think there is long-term value in stocks or real estate,” Thevenot explained.

While this marks a significant step in institutional crypto adoption, Austin is not alone. Last year, Emory University invested over $15 million in Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). It was the first endowment to gain direct exposure to the leading cryptocurrency.

Historically, endowments have maintained a conservative stance on cryptocurrencies, largely avoiding them. However, shifting regulatory landscapes and increasing acceptance of digital assets are encouraging a change in strategy.

**Why Are Endowment Funds Turning to Bitcoin?**

The growing pro-crypto stance of the US government has played a role in accelerating institutional interest. A recent executive order focused on strengthening leadership in digital finance is paving the way for broader blockchain adoption. This initiative promotes responsible growth in the digital asset sector.

A key part of this policy is the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by newly appointed crypto and AI czar David Sacks. The group is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, while also exploring the creation of a national digital asset reserve.

As a result, endowment funds are trooping into the emerging sector. For context, the Rockefeller Foundation, managing $4.8 billion in assets, has hinted at increasing its exposure to cryptocurrencies.

The foundation has previously invested in crypto-focused venture funds but is now considering deeper involvement, especially as broader market adoption gains momentum.

Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, acknowledged the uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. However, he emphasized the risk of missing out on substantial opportunities if the foundation does not take action.

“We don’t have a crystal ball on how cryptocurrencies will become in 10 years. We don’t want to be left behind when their potential materialises dramatically,” Lai said.

Market observers noted that the increasing integration of Bitcoin into institutional portfolios highlights its growing appeal as an alternative asset.

So, as regulatory frameworks become clearer, more institutional investors will recognize digital assets as viable components for their traditional financial portfolios, which would further cement Bitcoin’s role in mainstream finance.
