Munters Group agreed to sell its FoodTech Equipment business to American Industrial Partners' Grain & Protein Technologies for 97.5 million euros.

The business offers fans, ventilation and cooling systems, and evaporative cooling pads, according to a Sunday release. The transaction covers five production facilities in Italy, Germany, China, and the US, as well as one assembly hub in South Africa and three sales offices.

The sale and production of evaporative cooling pads in the Americas will not be part of the sale but will be combined with the Swedish heating and air treatment company's AirTech business area.

The transaction, which is expected to help streamline the company's foodtech operations, is expected to result in a capital loss of 500 million kronor. Completion is expected within the first half, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
