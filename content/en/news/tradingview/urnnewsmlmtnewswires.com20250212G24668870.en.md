Goldstone Resources said Wednesday that the monthly gold production at its Homase mine in Ghana doubled since November 2024, representing progress toward its doré monthly target of 1,000 ounces for 2025.

The mining and development company achieved 522 ounces of gold doré on Monday, compared with a monthly average of 225 troy ounces in 2024.

The company said operations ramped up to 48,000 tonnes of agglomerated stacked ore per month, with mining and heap leach processing on track. It also noted that lower-than-expected ore grades in pit 2 are impacting gold production, but operations will soon resume in the higher-grade pit 1, which was on hold pending stream relocation.
