SKOPJE (N. Macedonia), February 11 (SeeNews) - The European Central Bank (ECB) has agreed to extend the 400 million euro ($412.7 million) temporary repo line with the central bank of North Macedonia by two years, to January 31, 2027, North Macedonia's central bank said on Tuesday.

ECB extended the temporary repo line to North Macedonia at the request of the central bank, North Macedonia's central bank said in a press release.

Under a repo line, a national central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral. North Macedonia's central bank has not yet tapped the repo line.

The original repo line was set to expire on January 15, 2023, but was extended to January 2024 in late 2022 and to January 2025 in early 2024. It has been established since 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions via non-euro area central banks in view of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
