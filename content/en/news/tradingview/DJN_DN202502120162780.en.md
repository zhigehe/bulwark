Consumer inflation came in hotter than expected, but Goldman Sachs economists think the data still point to a decline in the 12-month readings of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Based on the CPI, Goldman thinks that headline PCE inflation was up 0.38% in January, with core PCE rising 0.45% month over month. That is still an elevated rate but would bring the 12-month increase in headline PCE down to 2.5%, from 2.6% in December, and the 12-month core PCE inflation rate down to 2.6%, from 2.8% in December, Goldman says. Analysts will be able to estimate PCE inflation with more certainty after January PPI figures land Thursday morning. PCE inflation data are due Feb. 28. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)
