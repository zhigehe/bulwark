CAR Group's guidance downgrade for its U.S. business doesn't worry Macquarie analysts, who see double-digit annual revenue growth as sustainable. They acknowledge that CAR's move to lower its outlook for Trader Interactive revenue growth prompted analysts to debate its significance, but ultimately decide that it was related to a delayed price rise.

Macquarie raises its target price 5.1% to A$39.00 and stays neutral on the stock, which is down 3.3% at A$37.10. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
