New Found Gold , which gained more than 5% in Canada yesterday, reported Tuesday results from five diamond drill holes completed as part of a step-out program at the Dropkick zone within the Kingsway property in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Results include 89.5 grams per tonne (g/t) gold over 5.85 meters and 26.2 g/t gold over 16.2 meters, a statement noted.

"This initial first-pass program at Dropkick is off to an excellent start and our team is thrilled by this early success," CEO Keith Boyle said. "Results like these are a testament to the strength of the gold mineral system associated with the [Appleton Fault Zone], and this exploration discovery at Dropkick exemplifies one of the reasons that drew me to New Found: the ongoing discovery potential and district-scale growth opportunity."

Kingsway forms the most northern extent of New Found Gold's Queensway project and is on trend with numerous discoveries made further south along the Appleton Fault Zone.

"This northern segment of [Appleton] has produced several early discoveries while significant stretches across this high-priority corridor remain unexplored providing a multitude of near-surface targets and discoveries with growth potential that will be a focus of our 2025 exploration program," Boyle said.

New Found Gold's share price rose 5.3% on Monday to $2.59 on the TSXV.
