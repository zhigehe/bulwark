Lineage Cell Therapeutics said Tuesday it started a clinical study evaluating OPC1, an investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived transplant for spinal cord injury.

OPC1 is designed to replace or support spinal cord cells that are absent or dysfunctional due to traumatic injury, aiming to restore or enhance functional activity in affected individuals, the company said.

The company said the study will assess the safety and utility of the Manual Inject Parenchymal Spinal Delivery System, a novel device developed to deliver OPC1 directly to the injury site.

It will enroll both subacute patients, treated between 21 and 42 days after injury, and chronic spinal cord injury patients, treated between one and five years after injury, according to the company.

Shares of Lineage Cell Therapeutics were down more than 2% in recent trading.
