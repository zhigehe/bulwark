**FX Info**

Function X is a blockchain network designed to replicate and innovate upon traditional financial products by offering decentralized financial solutions and a trading system. Its architecture is built upon a multichain framework, known as subnets, which is both customizable and scalable to cater to diverse business requirements.

The network operates with two primary subnets: one facilitates global retail payments by processing transactions on-chain, and the other supports the trading of cryptocurrency-based perpetual contracts and other derivatives. A distinctive feature of Function X is its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility ensures that developers can swiftly migrate their decentralized applications (dApps) to Function X, benefiting from reduced fees and enhanced security. Notably, Function X is among the pioneering projects to integrate an EVM-compatible chain within a Cosmos-based framework.

FX coin is a native token within the Function X ecosystem. It functions both as a governance token and a gas token for f(x)Core and f(x)EVM operations. Subnets within the ecosystem have the option to adopt FX as their gas token. Of its total supply, 20% was introduced during the Token Generation Event, while the remaining 80% is set to be distributed over 15 years, following a Proof of Service (PoS) model. This model rewards service providers for offering quality services within the ecosystem. The token’s maximum supply is capped at 1,893,022,622.314.
