**About Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.**

Aardvark is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics to activate innate homeostatic pathways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Its portfolio of small molecule programs targets biological pathways associated with alleviating hunger. Aardvark’s lead product candidate, ARD-101, targets Bitter Taste Receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed in the gut lumen, inducing secretion of endogenous signaling molecules, including the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which in turn activates gut-brain signals to suppress the sensation of hunger. This potential first-in-class oral investigational drug demonstrated clinical activity and was well-tolerated in Phase 2 trials and has entered Phase 3 development for hyperphagia associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome, for which Aardvark has been granted Orphan Drug Designation. Additionally, Aardvark intends to advance ARD-101 into Phase 2 development for hyperphagia associated with hypothalamic obesity, with a goal of addressing significant unmet needs across both these rare disease indications. Aardvark is also developing ARD-201, which will be a fixed-dose combination of ARD-101 with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, with a goal of addressing some of the limitations of currently marketed GLP-1 therapies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related conditions.
