Safran's year-end results offered few surprises as its results were in line with consensus expectations, JPMorgan analysts say in a research note. The French aerospace-industry supplier increased its guidance for civil aircraft engine spare part sales for the year to high-single digit percentage growth from up from mid-single to high-single digit growth previously, a move the analysts say doesn't seem spectacular. Nevertheless, consensus expectations for this year may rise by around 1% after the company raised its adjusted earnings and cash guidance for the year. Shares trade 0.65% higher at 247.40 euros.
