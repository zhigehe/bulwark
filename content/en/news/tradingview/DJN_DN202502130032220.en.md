Stabilization may lie ahead for bond markets as this week's duration-heavy supply in the eurozone is cleared and the macro calendar thins out, says Commerzbank Research's Hauke Siemssen in a note. However, positive risk sentiment on the latest headlines around Ukraine limits the potential in Bunds, the rates strategist says. U.S. President Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday had agreed to open immediate talks to end the war in Ukraine. Eurozone government bond supply will be modest in the remainder of the week, with only Italy auctioning 4.75 billion-5.75 billion euros in 2027- and 2031-dated bonds on Thursday. The 10-year Bund yield is little changed at 2.475%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
