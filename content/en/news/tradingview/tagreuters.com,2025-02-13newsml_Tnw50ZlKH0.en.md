Vancouver, BC - TheNewswire -February 13, 2025 - Global Energy Metals Corporation (TSXV:GEMC | OTCQB:GBLEF | FSE:5GE1)(“Global Energy Metals”, the “Company” and/or“GEMC”), a multi-jurisdictional,multi-commodity critical mineral exploration, development and projectgenerating company focused on growth-oriented projects supporting theglobal transition to clean energy, is pleased to announce itsstrategic partner NeoLithicaLtd.(“NeoLithica”) has entered into a direct lithium extraction(“DLE”) piloting agreement (the “Piloting Agreement”) withGeo40 LLC (“Geo40”) to conduct a DLE pilot test ofbrine sourced from NeoLithica’s Peace River Project in NW Alberta,Canada.

GEMC, in collaboration with NeoLithica,is currently undertaking astrategic evaluation to assess developmentoptions available toservice growing North American lithium market demand while maximizingthe long-term value of one of Canada’s largest lithium brineinferred resource.

Mitchell Smith, CEO and Directorcomments:

“When we first identified theinvestment opportunity in NeoLithica’s 10 million tonne lithiumbrine resource in Alberta, we recognized the need to aggressivelyevaluate paths forward for its accelerated development and the abilityto attract capital and build partnerships to advance this significantlithium brine resource while optimizing shareholder value in a timelymanner.

As a result of NeoLithica’s DLEpiloting agreement with Geo40, these objectives are already being realized, and the company islaying a foundation to accumulate valuable data, produce battery-gradelithium products for further testing by potential customers, and buildbusiness relationships for a market hungry for responsibly sourcedlithium.

We look forward to sharing theresults of the initial pilot testing as we join NeoLithica inidentifying the most advantageous path forward for theproject.”

Global Energy Metals recently announced that, subjectto TSX Venture Exchange approval, that it has entered into anon-binding Letter of Intent (the “Agreement”) with NeoLithica toacquire an eighteen month option to acquire a 19.9% interest and a 1%Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalty over NeoLithica’s Peace RiverLithium Project. For additional information on the terms of theAgreement and details on the Project please refer to GlobalEnergy’s news releasedated February 4, 2025.

To meet the objective of the piloting agreement withGeo40, in early February  NeoLithica transported 7,000 litres oflithium-brine collected from a producing well in the inferred resourcearea of the Peace River Project (Figure 1) to Geo40’s test facilityin Saskatchewan (the “DLE Test Facility”) to pilot test itsinnovative direct lithium extraction technology.

It is anticipated that the results of the DLE pilotprogram, expected to be completed in the coming weeks, will generatedata that will contribute to NeoLithica producing an economicassessment on the production of LiCl concentrate and further refinedtechnical- and battery-grade Li2CO3, extracted from itslithium-bearing brines. In addition, it is intended that the lithiumchloride and lithium carbonate chemistry will be made available to anumber of potential customers for their bench-top qualification testwork for battery applications. This is a critical step to potentiallybuilding partnerships and securing potential off-take agreements withglobal companies seeking sustainable and robust solutions to meettheir demand for lithium.

The pilot test conducted by Geo40, in conjunction withseveral pilot tests conducted by other  innovative DLE solutionsproviders, will assist NeoLithica’s in its selection of its primaryDLE vendor. It is contemplated that in future piloting campaignsNeoLithica intends to process brine from the company’s own wells aspart of future drill plans.
