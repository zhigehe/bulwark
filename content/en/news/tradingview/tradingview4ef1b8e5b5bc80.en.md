Tronox Holdings plc, a leading integrated manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigment, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31,Â 2024. The company reported a mixed performance with some key financial metrics showing improvement while others indicated challenges.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Tronox reported revenue of $676 million, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the same period in 2023. The company recorded an income from operations of $48 million, but a net loss of $30 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $129 million, representing a 37% increase year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.1%. The GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.19, while the adjusted diluted income per share was $0.03.

For the full year 2024, Tronox achieved total revenue of $3,074 million, an 8% increase from the previous year. The company reported an income from operations of $219 million and a net loss of $54 million, which includes a $49 million tax valuation allowance. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $564 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%. The GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.31, and the adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.08. Capital expenditures for the year amounted to $370 million, and the company returned $80 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Tronox's performance in the fourth quarter was driven by a 3% increase in TiO2 sales, which amounted to $533 million. This was due to a 4% increase in volumes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average selling prices and product mix. Zircon revenue increased by 32% to $75 million, driven by a 43% increase in volumes. However, revenue from other products declined by 38% year-over-year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Tronox has launched a cost improvement plan targeting $125-175 million of sustainable savings by the end of 2026. The company also focused on capital allocation, investing in business operations, and replacing mines reaching the end of their life. Additionally, Tronox strengthened its balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing transactions and returned $80 million to shareholders in dividends.

**Management's Perspective**

John D. Romano, Chief Executive Officer of Tronox, commented, "Tronox delivered fourth quarter results in line with expectations despite continued macro weakness. Strong TiO2 commercial performance in Asia Pacific and Latin America mitigated continued lagging demand in Europe, while North America performed as expected. Zircon sales exceeded our previous guidance, driven by strong execution from our commercial group."

Romano also highlighted the company's focus on safety, reducing total recordable injuries by 23% in 2024, and significant production cost improvements in the second half of the year. He emphasized the company's commitment to safety, continuous improvement, and disciplined cost management as they navigate through economic uncertainties.

**Future Outlook**

For the full year 2025, Tronox expects revenue to be in the range of $3.0-3.4 billion, driven by improving TiO2 and zircon volumes. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $525-625 million, with improved pigment production costs partially offset by higher mining production costs. Capital expenditures are expected to be $375-395 million, and free cash flow is anticipated to be relatively flat at the midpoint of the range. The company aims to achieve $125-175 million of sustainable, run-rate cost improvements by the end of 2026.
