NEW YORK CITY, NY / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / Fast Finance Pay Corp. (OTC PINK:FFPPD) today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Ole Jensen, CEO, President and Chairman of Fast Finance Pay Corp. stated, "All of our business units were successful throughout the entire year despite the challenging market environment due to high interest rates and uncertainty in some sectors. We saw continued increases in revenues, as well as gross and net profits. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on executing and navigating difficult macroeconomic conditions and believe our past investments strengthened our operations and will optimize the business for the near future."

Results for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2024

* Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 were $10.4 million, an increase of 130% from $4.5 million in the same period of 2023.
* Gross profit was $4.5 million, compared to $1.8 million in the same period of 2023.
* Net profit was $568 thousand, as compared to $244 thousand in the same period of 2023.

"We feel we are better positioned than we have been in the past to realize significant positive gains and long-term growth and profitability. We recently announced a reverse stock split that strengthened our capital structure which we believe will allow us to uplist onto a major stock exchange and continue to expand our business and deliver top and bottom-line results that will increase shareholder value," concluded Mr. Jensen.
