Chicago Board of Trade soybeans settled lower on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged U.S. supplies above forecasts while cutting its South American crop outlook.

* CBOT March soybeans (SH25) settled down 6 cents at $10.43-1/2 a bushel.
* CBOT March soymeal (SMH25) ended $3.90 lower at $296.60 per short ton.
* March soyoil (BOH25) rose 0.4 cent to 46.13 cents per pound.
* The agency pegged U.S. ending stocks at 380 million bushels, unchanged from January.
* Argentina, a major grain supplier, will harvest less soy than previously expected after hot, dry weather hurt crops, the USDA said on Tuesday.
* Traders are continuing to monitor if the latest U.S. tariff measure will bring fallout for agricultural trade.
* U.S. President [Donald Trump's](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) announcement on Monday of increased tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports rekindled concern about retaliatory actions against U.S. exports, including crops.
* As of February 6, Brazil's soybean harvest for the 2024-25 season was 15% complete, still lagging last year's pace and contributing to slower planting of the second corn crop, consultancy AgRural said on Monday.
* Agribusiness consultancies diverged on Tuesday about the size of the country's 2024/25 soybean crop, with AgResource hiking its forecast after a crop tour while Patria AgroNegocios trimmed its projection for the second consecutive month.
