The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the 10th rotational mission of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft is targeted for launch on March 12.

Takeoff will be from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the mission will carry a crew of four to the International Space Station.

NASA astronaut Anne McClain will command the mission and Nichole Ayers will be the pilot. The flight will be McClain's second and Ayers' first.

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will be aboard as mission specialists. The flight will be the first for Peskov and the second for Onishi.
