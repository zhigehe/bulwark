Supply chain reshoring has become a significant theme in global industrial markets due to rising geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions. Businesses are shifting production back to their home countries, benefitting companies that support domestic manufacturing and logistics.

Given this positive outlook, it might be considered wise for investors to add three fundamentally strong industrial stocks, Tennant Company , Donaldson Company, Inc. , and The Gorman-Rupp Company , for substantial gain.

With Trump’s administration, this year is set to bring regulations, technology, and labor changes. Many manufacturers are expecting more growth and investment without the regulatory burden under Trump’s office.

President Trump is expected to levy tariffs against top trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and China, complicating the supply chain. However, this could also mean increased demand for manufacturing companies with strong domestic production. Companies with strong localized supply chains stand to benefit from these policies.

Since labor costs are often higher in domestic markets compared to overseas production hubs, manufacturers are investing in automation and robotics to enhance efficiency. Further, the global industrial services market is anticipated to reach $59.1 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.6%.

To that end, let’s evaluate the fundamental aspects of the three Industrial - Machinery stocks mentioned above, starting with the third choice.
