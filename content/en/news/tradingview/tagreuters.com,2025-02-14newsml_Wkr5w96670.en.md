Qlife Holding AB

Qlife is proud to announce the expansion of the Egoo.Health biomarker menu within the General Health business area, further strengthening its commitment to women’s health and health in general. This expansion focuses on Thyroid Disease and Vitamin D, introducing biomarkers such as Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Triiodothyronine (T3), and Vitamin D.

The newly added biomarkers for Thyroid Disease and Vitamin D will be launched on the recently announced CE-IVD-marked platform, developed in collaboration with Hipro Biotechnology. With the addition of TSH and T3 biomarkers, Qlife strengthens its presence in the women's health market. Meanwhile, the launch of the Vitamin D biomarker aligns with Qlife's focus on General Health, targeting a broader mass market. As previously announced in a separate press release, sales of the platform and its biomarker portfolio will commence in February.

**Thyroid disease**

TSH, T3, and Vitamin D play a critical role in immune function and provide deeper insights into key health concerns. More than 1 in 10 people will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime, with women being five to eight times more likely than men to experience thyroid issues. Undiagnosed thyroid disease can lead to serious conditions, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and infertility.

**Vitamin D**

In addition to its primary benefits, which most people are familiar with, research suggests that Vitamin D also plays a role in reducing the risk of heart disease, severe respiratory illnesses, and autoimmune diseases.

"By introducing new biomarkers like TSH, T3, and Vitamin D, we are providing women with the tools they need to take a proactive approach to their well-being. This is just the beginning, as we continue to expand our offerings to support women's health

Our Vitamin D product is expected to reach a broad market, as a significant number of people are uncertain about their Vitamin D levels and often take supplements without knowing their actual needs. Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread issue in the Nordics, and many people could likely experience a better day-to-day life if their Vitamin D levels were optimized. With Egoo, you can accurately measure your quantitative Vitamin D level, determine whether supplementation is necessary, and continue monitoring until you reach a healthy balance.

We have decided to price the platform at consumer pricing level so that we believe everyone will be able to afford it". - Says Thomas Warthoe, CEO of Qlife
