Court: W.D. Washington

Case: 2:22-cv-00617

Amazon shares slipped 3.3% in premarket trading after AWS revenue came in just below expectations, fueling concerns over Big Tech’s AI investments. Analysts note that AWS may not see significant growth until late 2025 or beyond, though Amazon’s retail segment helped offset the slowdown.

Meanwhile, Amazon investors can still file late claims in the case over alleged unfair business practices. You can find more details about it [here](https://11thestate.com/cases/amazon-investor-suit) and stay updated on any future changes.
