On 5 February 2025 Vestum AB (publ) (“Vestum”) announced that, subject to certain conditions, the company intends to redeem in full its outstanding bonds of series 2023/2026 (ISIN SE0020996890) (the “Bonds”) on 3 mars 2025.

The early redemption was conditional upon certain divestments, announced on November 29, 2024, being completed prior to 14 February 2025. As the divestments have been completed the early redemption of the Bonds is therefore no longer conditional.

The Bonds will be redeemed at the redemption price of 103.1875 per cent. of the total outstanding nominal amount (i.e. SEK 1,289,843.75 per bond) together with any accrued and unpaid interest.

The Redemption Amount will be paid to each person who is registered as owner of the Bonds in the debt registers maintained by Euroclear Sweden at the end of business on 24 February 2025. In connection with the redemption, the Bonds will be delisted from Nasdaq Stockholm.
