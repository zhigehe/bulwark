Neola Medical received approval from the Swedish Medical Products Agency and the Ethical Review Authority to conduct a pilot study on preterm babies in Sweden using its medical device for continuous lung monitoring.

The study will evaluate the safety and performance of Neola in 10 preterm born babies in neonatal intensive care, with the patients starting at 28 weeks of gestational age and weighing between 1,000 and 3,000 grams, according to a Tuesday release. The pilot is expected to take four months and begin in 2025.

The Swedish medical devices developer said the results from the clinical study will optimize and refine Neola and help prepare for the US-based study required to obtain US Food and Drug Administration approval.
