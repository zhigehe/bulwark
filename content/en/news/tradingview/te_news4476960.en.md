The UK Residential Market Survey by RICS revealed that the house price balance—tracking the difference between respondents reporting price increases and those noting declines—fell to +22% in January 2025, down from +26% in December.

This drop missed expectations, which had forecast a slight rise to +27%.

Despite this, the survey still indicates that overall house prices are trending upwards.

A closer look at the regional data reveals that house prices continue to rise across the UK, with Northern Ireland and the North West of England experiencing the most robust growth.

In contrast, price growth appears slower in Yorkshire & the Humber and the South East at present.

Looking ahead, the three-month price expectations balance dropped significantly to +3% from +14%, while the twelve-month outlook remained largely unchanged at +52%, compared to +53% last month.
