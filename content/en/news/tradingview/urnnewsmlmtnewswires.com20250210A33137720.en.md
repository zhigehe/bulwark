Deutsche Bank was fined 10 million euros ($10.3 million) by Spain's CNMV for selling complex derivatives to clients who later claimed they did not fully understand the products and suffered steep financial losses, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing the country's official gazette.

Spain's security regulators also ordered a suspension of investment advisory activity by Deutsche Bank on some complex derivative products for one year, according to the news outlet.

The bank plans to appeal the decision, a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank reportedly told Bloomberg.

Neither Deutsche Bank nor CNMV immediately responded to MT Newswires' requests for comment.
