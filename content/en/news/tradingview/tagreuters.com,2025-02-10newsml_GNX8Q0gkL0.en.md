TORONTO, Feb. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Questrade (www.questrade.com) — Canada’s #1 rated¹ online brokerage — eliminates trading commissions on its platforms, further empowering Canadians.

“We are continuing our tradition of disrupting the industry,” said Edward Kholodenko, president and CEO, Questrade. “We believe Canadians should keep more of their money, and $0 commissions, coupled with our industry-leading platform, will help them do just that - whether they are just starting out or are highly sophisticated traders.”

The new $0 pricing, which is now live, will allow Questrade customers to trade Canadian and U.S. listed equities and ETFs commission-free, with options as low as 75¢ per contract².

Because news this big needed a launch to match, Questrade partnered with actor Gabriel Macht. Known for portraying characters who “get theirs,” Gabriel introduces Canadians to the idea of $0 commissions being the way for you to finally “Get Yours.” Macht says, “I really respect what Questrade stands for as a brand, to me the partnership was the perfect fit.”

Questrade, a 100% Canadian-owned independent brokerage, has a long history of providing value to Canadians. It was first to reduce trading fees to $9.95, when most brokerages charged $30 or more. Then, Questrade introduced the $4.95 stock trade, and shook things up again with stock trading for as little as one cent per share.

However, the company’s innovation isn’t just its pricing. On top of $0 commissions, Questrade has an unmatched suite of offerings, such as:

* Being the first Canadian broker to offer the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), helping customers save for a home faster
* Award-winning customer service³
* Edge platforms for advanced traders, available on mobile, web, and desktop
* Complex order types, such as multi-leg options
* Seamless integration with 30+ platforms, including TradingView and Passiv
* Lower fees for better returns with Questwealth Portfolios⁴
* Free U.S. dollar (USD) accounts

“We are obsessed with helping our customers build a better financial future - that’s our mission,” said Kholodenko.
