China Zhonghua Geotechnical Engineering Group's subsidiary, Shanghai Yuanfang Foundation Engineering, was listed on China's list of dishonest persons, according to a Shenzhen Stock Exchange filing on Thursday.

A court ordered the inclusion of Yuanfang Foundation Engineering into the list after failing to pay its debt to Liang Yunqing, despite an arbitration court ordering the payment.

The Chinese engineering services provider's subsidiary filed an application for the revocation of the order, the filing said.

The company's shares closed less than 5% higher.
