Chicago Board of Trade corn futures ticked up on strong demand as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's supply and demand report that showed tightening global corn stocks.

* CBOT March corn (CH25) settled up 6-1/4 cents at $4.90-1/4 a bushel.
* Corn futures received a hefty boost after the USDA pegged worldwide corn ending stocks below market expectations in its Tuesday report.
* Corn production is particularly important because world inventories for 2024-25 are projected to drop to their lowest level in a decade due to robust demand and a smaller than anticipated U.S. harvest last year.
* The USDA reported exporters sold 130,320 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations in a private sale for 2024/2025 delivery.
* Heavy rains have drenched the most-parched parts of Argentina's key agricultural region in recent hours, the Rosario Grains Exchange said on Wednesday, bringing relief to the soy and corn crops.
* A hefty sale of corn to Mexico on Monday has continued to add support to the market, indicating strong demand for U.S. products.
