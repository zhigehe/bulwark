Lithuania’s current account surplus narrowed sharply to EUR 62.79 million in December 2024, down from EUR 145.99 million in the same month of the previous year.

The decline was primarily driven by a widening goods account deficit, which more than doubled to EUR 630.46 million from EUR 304.56 million a year earlier, and a decrease in the services account surplus to EUR 598.3 million from EUR 623.02 million.

On the other hand, the primary income balance shifted to a surplus of EUR 52.77 million from a deficit of EUR 161.7 million, while the secondary income balance swung to a EUR 42.18 million surplus from a EUR 10.77 million deficit.
