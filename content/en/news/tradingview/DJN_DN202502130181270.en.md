Copper edges higher in early Asian trade. Prices rose recently due to risk-on sentiment on the back of the prospect of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, ANZ Research analysts say in a note. Copper is widely used in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The red metal also continues to shrug off an uncertain economic backdrop dominated by U.S. tariff news and continued sluggishness in China's property sector, they write. The three-month LME copper contract is 0.2% higher at $9,501.00/ton.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)
