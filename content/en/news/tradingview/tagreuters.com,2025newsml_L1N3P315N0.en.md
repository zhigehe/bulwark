Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures eased on Wednesday, a day after a U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed a higher-than-expected forecast of U.S. soybean stocks, coupled with continued concerns over weak Chinese demand for U.S. soy, analysts said.

* CBOT March soybeans (SH25) settled down 15-3/4 cents to $10.27-3/4 per bushel.
* CBOT March soymeal (SMH25) ended down $2.5 to $294.10 per short ton, and March soyoil (BOH25) fell 0.47 cent to 45.66 cents per pound.
* In its monthly report on Tuesday, the USDA projected U.S. soybean end-of-season supplies above market expectations while cutting Argentina's soybean production outlook after hot and dry weather wilted crops.
* However, global soybean supplies are still expected to be significant due to a bumper crop in top producer Brazil.
* Heavy rains have drenched the most parched parts of Argentina's key agricultural region in recent hours, the Rosario Grains Exchange said on Wednesday, bringing relief to the soy crop.
* The USDA reported that exporters sold 120,000 tons of soybeans to unknown destinations in a private sale for 2024/2025 delivery.
