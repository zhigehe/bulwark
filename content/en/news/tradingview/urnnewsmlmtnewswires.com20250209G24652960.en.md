Inghams Group said its operations and supply chain are unaffected by the recent Avian Influenza detection at a Northern Victoria layer egg farm, as none of its commercial broiler farms are in the impacted region, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The company has reinforced biosecurity measures across its Victorian facilities as a precautionary step, the filing said.
