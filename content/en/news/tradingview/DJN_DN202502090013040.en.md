Iron ore prices are lower in early Asian trading. U.S. President Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, a move which could hurt the demand of the black metal. However, iron ore prices may still find some near-term support, thanks to seasonal strong demand and supply, according to Nanhua Futures analysts in a commentary. Investors are likely to focus on changes on demand, as mainland China gradually returns to work after a week-long Lunar New Year holiday, they add. The most-traded iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is down 0.3% at CNY809.0/ton. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
