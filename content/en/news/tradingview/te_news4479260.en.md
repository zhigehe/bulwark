The Australian dollar rose above $0.632 on Friday, approaching two-month highs as the greenback weakened after US President Donald Trump delayed implementing reciprocal tariffs, easing concerns about escalating global trade tensions.

Components of the latest US PPI report also suggested that the Fed-preferred core PCE inflation, due later this month, may come in lower than anticipated.

The weaker US dollar boosted commodity prices, further lifting market sentiment.

Domestically, Australian consumer inflation expectations increased to a ten-month high of 4.6% in February, up from 4% in January.

Despite this, markets still expect the Reserve Bank of Australia start cutting interest rates next week, with a total of 75 basis points in easing expected this year.
