The benchmark KOSPI rose 0.9% to around 2,543 points early Tuesday, after pausing in the previous session, driven by biopharmaceutical and shipbuilding stocks.

Traders largely shrugged off Trump's new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which were seemingly priced in for months.

Despite Trump's remarks about potentially imposing additional tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceuticals, key South Korean exports, investors remained optimistic that the impact would be less severe than expected.

Among health stocks, Samsung Biologics climbed 4.7%, while Celltrion added 1%.

In the shipbuilding sector, Hyundai Heavy Industries (2.2%), Hanwha Ocean (6.9%), and Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (1.4%) led the gains.
