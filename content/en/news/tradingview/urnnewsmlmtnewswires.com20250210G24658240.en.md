A UK court on Monday approved the scheme of arrangement for N Brown Group's planned acquisition by Joshua Alliance's Falcon 24 Topco.

The scheme is expected to take effect on Feb. 12, with the cancellation of the British retailer's shares on the AIM segment of the London bourse scheduled for the next day.

In October 2024, Falcon offered 0.40 pound sterling in cash for the remaining N Brown shares it does not own, which valued the latter's entire issued share capital at 191 million pounds on a fully diluted basis.
