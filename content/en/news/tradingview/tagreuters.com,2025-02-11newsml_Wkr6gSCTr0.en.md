MTG

During the period between 3 February 2025 and 7 February 2025 Modern Times Group MTG AB (publ) (LEI code 549300E8NDODRSX29339) ("MTG") repurchased, in total, 75,000 own class B shares (ISIN code SE0018012494) under the share repurchase program initiated by the Board of Directors.

The share buy-backs form a part of the share repurchase program of a maximum of 5,789,385 shares for a maximum amount of SEK 400 million, which MTG announced on 16 May 2024. The share repurchase program, which runs from 17 May 2024 up until and including 30 April 2025, is being carried out in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 ("MAR") and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/1052 (the "Safe Harbour Regulation"). The objectives of the share buy-backs are to deliver shareholder value and to optimize the capital structure of the company. The intention is to reduce MTG's share capital through subsequent share cancellations.

Class B shares in MTG have been repurchased (in SEK) as follows:

| Date | Aggregated daily volume (number of shares) | Weighted average share price per day (SEK) | Total daily transaction value (SEK) |  |

| 07/02/2025 | 15,000 | 117.6876 | 1,765,314.00 |  |  |

All acquisitions have been carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm by Kepler Cheuvreux on behalf of MTG. Following the above acquisitions, MTG's holding of own shares as of 7 February 2025 amounts to 3,983,767 class B shares and 6,280,623 class C shares. The total number of shares in MTG amounts to 128,136,328. The number of own Class B shares held by MTG and the total number of shares in MTG reflect the cancellation of 3,358,100 Class B shares on 5 August 2024, the cancellation of 174,299 Class B shares on 5 February 2025 and the reclassification of 43,720 C shares into B shares on 29 January 2025.

A full breakdown of the transactions pursuant to article 5.3 of MAR and article 2.3 of the Safe Harbour Regulation is attached to this announcement.
