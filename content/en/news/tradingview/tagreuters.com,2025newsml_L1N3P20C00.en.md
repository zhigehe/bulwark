Middle East crude benchmark spot premiums of Oman, Dubai and Murban moved little on Tuesday as light trading activities persisted.

Saudi Arabia's crude oil supply to China is set to slide in March from the prior month, trade sources said on Tuesday, after the kingdom hiked its prices to the highest in more than two years.

Saudi Aramco will ship about 41 million barrels to China in March, a tally of allocations to Chinese refiners showed, down from February's 43.5 million barrels. The figure marks a second consecutive monthly drop of the state oil firm's allocation to China.

Chinese state major Sinopec and Aramco's joint venture, the Fujian refinery, will be lifting less crude in March, while Aramco will increase its supply to PetroChina and private refiner Shenghong Petrochemical, the trade sources said.
