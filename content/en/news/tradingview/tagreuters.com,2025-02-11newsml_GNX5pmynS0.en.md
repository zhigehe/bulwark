ALAMEDA, Calif., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Jitterbit, a global leader in accelerating business transformation for enterprise systems, today announced its latest AI-infused capabilities within the Harmony platform, advancing AI from low-code development to natural language processing (NLP). With NLP, technical barriers are removed and users can create, modify, and expose APIs, as well as build, monitor, and manage complex applications — all through natural language commands.

“AI acts as a bridge between IT and line-of-business users, fostering true collaboration across the enterprise,” said Jitterbit President and CEO Bill Conner. “By infusing AI natural language processing into the Harmony platform, we’re simplifying the building, integrating, connecting, and exposing of applications. What were once isolated applications now become interconnected enterprise systems, enabling seamless connections and integrations to enterprise-wide processes.”

“AI is no longer just a tool — it’s the catalyst for seamless, end-to-end automation that drives innovation at every level of business,” said Antonio Cisternino, CIO and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pisa. “With Jitterbit’s new AI capabilities, organizations can now gain a holistic view of their data, powered by enterprise systems that are fully automated from end to end, driving smarter decisions and accelerating business outcomes in a controlled way.”

Building on its vision for advancing AI, Jitterbit’s integration of NLP technology into its unified, AI-infused low-code Harmony platform makes it even easier for users to automate applications and workflows by significantly reducing the development time and effort required to develop applications, manage APIs and integrate complex enterprise systems.

"By eliminating the need for traditional coding, NLP makes developing applications, building and managing APIs, and integrating complex workflows accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise," said Jitterbit CTO Manoj Chaudhary. "This advancement is a critical milestone on the path toward agentic AI, where systems can intelligently adapt, learn, and execute autonomously.”

New Jitterbit AI Assistants Accelerate Application, API Management

Jitterbit’s new AI-infused capabilities redefine how users leverage the Harmony platform to generate code faster and accelerate innovation.

“Users can use simple natural language to create actionable code, enabling them to develop, manage, and integrate applications and systems seamlessly across the business — saving hundreds of hours in the process,” said Chaudhary.

* **AI-Infused App Builder Assistant:** An AI assistant designed to effortlessly create new applications and manage and modify existing ones using natural language. This feature is now in beta and available to Jitterbit customers. General availability is planned for Q2 2025.
* **AI-Infused API Manager:** Jitterbit API Manager empowers users to create APIs using an AI assistant to simplify API development and accelerate time to value. A beta program for this feature is now available with general availability planned for Jitterbit customers in Q2 2025.
* **AskJB AI:** An intelligent assistant providing real-time answers, guidance, and information is generally available within the Harmony platform and Jitterbit Documentation.

Jitterbit Introduces New Observability Tools, Cloud Datastore and Security Standards

Building on its AI-infused capabilities, Jitterbit introduced new observability and cloud storage features as well as new security certifications in the Harmony platform — designed to give organizations unmatched visibility, streamlined data management, and enhanced protection for their critical business processes.

* Agent Observability for Integration Performance Optimization: offers real-time visibility into the performance and behavior of private agents deployed on customer-managed servers, within firewalls, or in virtual private clouds. With pre-built dashboards for Datadog and Elasticsearch, customers can access over 50 key metrics to gain deeper operational insights addressing anomalies before they disrupt operations. A beta is now open to Jitterbit customers.
* Cloud Datastore for Streamlined Integration Data Management: Cloud Datastore is a cloud-based storage solution that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve data within their integration workflows. It acts as a central repository for data that various Jitterbit applications, APIs and integrations built on the Harmony platform can access. The Cloud Datastore is typically used to persist data for applications that require seamless data exchange or for integrations that need temporary or long-term storage of structured or unstructured data. Cloud Datastore also is GDPR-compliant for the European Union (EU). A beta is coming to Jitterbit customers in Q1 2025.
* **Elevated Security Standards:** Building on its layered security foundation, Jitterbit has attained new security certifications, including ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 compliance, along with NZISM certification for New Zealand and Australia. These certifications ensure that Jitterbit meets the highest global security standards.
