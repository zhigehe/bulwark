Australian consumers are being watched closely amid concerns that a possible recovery in spending could derail an interest-rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. Still, the monthly CommBank Household Spending Insights Index was flat in January as consumers took a breather from opening their wallets following sale activity in the final months of 2024. The January result was somewhat expected following a spike in spending in the last three months of 2024 off the back heavy price discounting, says CBA senior economist Belinda Allen. CBA is forecasting a cut in the RBA's official cash rate next week, she adds. The HSI index tracks on-month payments data by approximately 7 million CBA customers, comprising roughly 30% of all Australian consumer transactions. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
