The European Union acknowledged the increased US tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and will take "firm and proportionate countermeasures," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday.

"Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered," Von der Leyen said. "The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests. We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers."

US President Donald Trump on Monday increased the tariff rate to 25% from 10%. The additional tax will take effect from March 4, with no country exceptions and quota deals.

While Trump hopes the measures will support struggling industries in the US, the European Commission president said the "regretful" move will be harmful to businesses and consumers.
