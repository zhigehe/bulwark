Cresud S.A.C.I.F. y A. announces its results for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 ended December 31, 2024

PR Newswire

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, Feb. 10, 2025

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Cresud S.A.C.I.F. y A. (, BYMA: CRES), leading Argentine agricultural company, announces today its results for the second quarter of FY 2025 ended December 31, 2024.

HIGHLIGHTS

* The net result for the first half of fiscal year 2025 registered a loss of ARS 64,391 million. This result is mainly explained by the loss due to changes in the fair value of IRSA investment properties.
* The adjusted EBITDA for the period reached ARS 134,961 million, 15.3% lower than the same period in 2024. The agribusiness adjusted EBITDA was ARS 35,262 million and the Urban adjusted EBITDA (through IRSA), ARS 103,136 million.
* The 2025 campaign is developing with historically low commodity prices, although a slight recovery was observed in the last quarter, reduced input costs, and favorable weather conditions in the region. We planted 303,000 hectares in the region, 9% more than the previous season.
* In January 2025, the Argentine government announced a temporary reduction in crops tax exports until June 30, 2025, lowering soybean from 33% to 26% and wheat and corn from 12% to 9.5%. This had a positive impact on spot and future crop prices of approximately 5%.
* During the first half of fiscal year 2025, we sold a fraction of Los Pozos farm in Argentina for USD 2.2 million and our subsidiary BrasilAgro sold a fraction of its Alto Taquari farm for BRL 189.4 million.
* On November 2024, we distributed a cash dividend of ARS 45,000 million (dividend yield 7%).
