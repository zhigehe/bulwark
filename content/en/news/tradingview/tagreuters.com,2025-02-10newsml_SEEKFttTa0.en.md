BUCHAREST (Romania), February 10 (SeeNews) - Gas and electricity provider E.ON Energie Romania, a subsidiary of German utility group E.ON, said on Monday that it has financed and developed a 1,545.6 kWp photovoltaic (PV) plant for Webasto Romania, a unit of German automotive supplier Webasto, under a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

The 1 million euro ($1.03 million) PV plant will generate around 1,530 MWh of green energy per year, covering over 23% of the company's electricity needs, E.ON Energie Romania said in a press release. Under the PPA, the entire output of the PV plant located at Webasto Romania's factory in the western commune of Zimandu Nou, Arad county, will be sold to Webasto at a fixed price with annual indexation.

"We want to grow more and more in the area of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts, and the partnership with Webasto is a first step in this direction," E.ON Energie Romania general director Claudia Griech said.

The PV plant will also contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by around 467.74 tonnes annually.

E.ON Energie Romania serves around 3.5 million customers, including residential clients, companies, and municipalities and has a portfolio of over 392 completed PV projects in the non-residential segment, with a total value of 74 million euro and a cumulated solar production capacity of 104 GWh per year.

In December, Hungarian state-owned power utility MVM Group and the German utility group agreed on MVM's acquisition of two Romanian subsidiaries of E.ON, namely E.ON Energie Romania and service company E.ON Asist Complet. Last month, Romania's energy ministry notified the Commission for the Examination of Foreign Direct Investments of the agreed takeover, saying that MVM Group has extensive trade relations with Russia's Gazprom and Rosatom.

At the Arad factory, established in 2008, Webasto Romania produces car roof systems for various European clients.
