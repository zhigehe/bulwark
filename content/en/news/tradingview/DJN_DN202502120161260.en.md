By Erin Mulvaney and Gretchen Tarrant Gulla

A federal judge on Wednesday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its buyout offer that encourages federal workers to voluntarily resign, rejecting an attempt by labor unions to pause a program meant to shrink the government workforce.

U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Massachusetts lifted a previous temporary order that blocked the buyout while he considered arguments by unions challenging it.

The judge, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said in a five-page opinion that the unions lacked proper legal standing to challenge the buyout program because they were not directly impacted by it. He also said aggrieved employees could first bring any claims through an administrative review process.

The case, brought by the American Federation of Government Employees and other unions that represent federal workers, is the latest in a flurry of lawsuits challenging efforts by President Trump and his administration to radically overhaul the federal government.

Updates to follow as news develops.
