BELGRADE (Serbia), February 10 (SeeNews) - Serbian chemical products maker Tehnohemija [BEL:THHM] said it has launched an offer to buy back up to 3% of its own equity.

The Belgrade-based company plans to buy up to 30,736 own shares at 250 dinars ($2.2/ 2.1 euro) apiece between February 7 and March 10, it said in a filing with the Belgrade bourse on Friday.

Tehnohemija's total equity capital is divided into 1,024,544 shares of 1,000 dinars in par value each.

Tehnohemija currently owns 0.56% of its own shares, which it repurchased in a buyback programme launched in July last year, when it aimed to buy up to 2% of its own equity.

As of February 10, Belgrade-based brokerage Tesla Capital is the largest shareholder in Tehnohemija with a 25% stake, followed by local steel distribution and processing company Metaling with 24.4%. The remainder belongs to a number of minority shareholders, according to data from Serbia's central securities depository and clearing house.

Tehnohemija shares last traded on January 17, closing flat at 250 dinars

(1 euro = 117.072 dinars)
