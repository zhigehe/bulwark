**Gross Profit:** $145.0 million, an increase of $5.4 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower raw material costs, pricing, and a net benefit from insurance recoveries and an advanced manufacturing production credit.

**Operating Income:** $31.7 million, an increase from $28.5 million in the prior year quarter, driven by pricing, lower raw material costs, and restructuring savings.

**Net Income:** $19.0 million, a decrease from $24.3 million in the prior year quarter, impacted by lower sales and production volumes.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments**

The Metal Cutting segment reported a sales decline of 4% for the three months ended December 31,Â 2024, driven by a 7% organic sales decline, partially offset by a 3% favorable business days effect. The Infrastructure segment's sales remained flat, with a 4% organic sales decline offset by a 3% business days effect and a 1% favorable currency exchange effect.

**Geographical Performance**

In the Metal Cutting segment, sales in the Americas declined due to decreases in the General Engineering and Transportation end markets, while EMEA saw declines in Transportation and General Engineering. Asia Pacific sales were flat due to lower economic activity. For Infrastructure, sales in the Americas decreased due to lower mining activity, while EMEA sales increased in Aerospace & Defense and Earthworks. Asia Pacific sales decreased due to lower mining activity.

**Sales Units**

The Metal Cutting segment experienced a decrease in production volumes, impacting operating income. The Infrastructure segment also faced lower production volumes, but this was offset by favorable pricing and insurance recoveries.

**New Production Launches**

The company announced plans to close a facility in Greenfield, MA, and consolidate two facilities near Barcelona, Spain, into a single modern facility by the end of fiscal 2027. These actions are expected to deliver annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $15 million by the end of fiscal 2025.
