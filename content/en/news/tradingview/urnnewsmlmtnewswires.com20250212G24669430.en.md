Germany's blue-chip DAX index was 0.50% in the green on Wednesday's close as investors digest the latest inflation data from the world's top economy.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, annual inflation in the US rose to 3% in January from 2.9% a month ago, against the consensus estimate of 2.9%. On the other hand, the core rate was 3.3%, compared with the previous 3.2% and the expected 3.1%.

The inflation report comes after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said there is no need to hurry in adjusting monetary policy in his testimony before the US Congress.

Back at home, Deutsche Bundesbank said the nation's current account surplus was 24 billion euros in December 2024, up by 2.1 billion euros from the prior month. Meanwhile, manufacturing export conditions remained steady in January 2025, reflecting subdued global demand. The headline HCOB Germany manufacturing PMI export conditions index was unchanged month over month at 50 points.

"The lack of momentum from abroad, the structural problems Germany is grappling with, and the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's tariff plans and ongoing geopolitical tensions are causing a gloomy mood across virtually all export sectors," Hamburg Commercial Bank Chief Economist Cyrus de la Rubia said.

In corporate news, Siemens Energy added 4.96% after its "strong" fiscal first-quarter results, with both attributable net income and revenue up year over year.

Bernstein upgraded Lufthansa to outperform from market-perform, with the price target up to 8 euros from 6.75 euros. The German airline was 3.12% higher at closing.

"Lufthansa offers significant exposure to the North Atlantic market at a discounted valuation. The company also has soft comps in 2025, owing to strike action in H1Â 2024, which look underappreciated by consensus," Bernstein wrote.
