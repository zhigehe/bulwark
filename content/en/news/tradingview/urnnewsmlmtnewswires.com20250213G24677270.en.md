Golden Horse Minerals found high-grade gold mineralization during a maiden drilling program in its Hakes Find gold project in Western Australia, according to a Friday filing with the Australian bourse.

The drilling program results yielded eight meters at 4.84 grams per ton of gold from a depth of 26 meters including one meter at 25.89 g/t gold.

Planning is underway for metallurgical testing and further infill drilling to extend down-dip mineralization and strike extensions associated with the historic workings at the project, the filing added.
