Seven of Redfin.com's 10 most-viewed home listings in January were in the Bay Area, particularly the East Bay and near San Jose, with two in Seattle's eastside suburbs. One popular listing was in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, amid recent wildfires. Nine listings exceed $1 million, five surpass $2 million, far above the U.S. median home price of $430,000. High interest in Silicon Valley and Seattle stems from limited desirable homes, despite improving inventory, and tech workers returning to offices. Amazon's mandate impacted 12,000 Bellevue workers, while Bay Area listings near Tesla and Meta offices also drew attention. These regions, among the most populous and highest-income U.S. metro areas, naturally attract significant viewership. (chris.wack@wsj.com)
