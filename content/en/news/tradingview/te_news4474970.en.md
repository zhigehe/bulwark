The DAX rose about 0.6% to finish at 22,034 on Tuesday, a fresh record high, driven by technology stocks and banks.

Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor corporate earnings while also assessing Fed Powell's latest remarks ahead of key inflation data set to be released tomorrow.

During his testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear that the Federal Reserve is focused on restoring inflation to the 2% target, with no immediate plans to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, caution prevailed across global markets after President Donald Trump outlined the promised 25% tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, and hinted at further reciprocal measures in the coming days.
