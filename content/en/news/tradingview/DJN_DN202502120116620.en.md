Joann plans to close about 500 stores, out of about 800 that it operated as of the time of its January chapter 11 filing.

The craft-focused retailer said in January that its stores remained open and that it would seek to sell substantially all of its assets, selecting Gordon Brothers Retail Partners as a stalking-horse bidder.

Joann said Wednesday that it is seeking bankruptcy court authority to begin closing stores.

"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve," the company said.
