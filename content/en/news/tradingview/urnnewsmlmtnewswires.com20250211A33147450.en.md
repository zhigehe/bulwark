Firefly Neuroscience shares were up more than 170% in recent trading after the company said it was accepted into the Nvidia (NVDA) Connect program.

Intraday trading volume catapulted to over 155 million shares from a daily average of about 2.48 million.

Lipella Pharmaceuticals said its treatment candidate for oral lichen planus showed "clinically meaningful" reductions in pain, ulceration, and inflammation across all key metrics in a phase 2a trial.

Shares soared about 36% as intraday trading volume surged to over 37.2 million from a daily average of about 1.59 million.

Travere Therapeutics said it completed a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration and plans to submit a supplemental new drug application for approval of Filspari for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a rare kidney disorder.

Wedbush raised its price target on the stock to $30 from $26 while maintaining its outperform rating.

Shares of Travere rose 13% as intraday trading volume climbed to over 3.62 million from a daily average of about 1.29 million.
