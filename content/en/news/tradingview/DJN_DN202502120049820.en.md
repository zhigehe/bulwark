Marc Fogel was a history teacher before he was arrested in a Kremlin operation and thrown in a Russian prison. Now that he's free, his case shows how the U.S. struggles to decide which Americans jailed overseas are worthy of rescue. In Washington, Trump administration officials are discussing plans to curtail and combine the power of banking regulators — without Congress's input. And world leaders are studying the deal that Mexico's leader negotiated with President Trump in preparation for their own trade talks.

Expert Take

Q: Is Trump's federal worker buyout plan legal?

The president enjoys considerable power to reshape and shrink the federal workforce, but his administration's swift actions so far have raised legal questions about the outer bounds of his authority. Jacob Gershman and Erin Mulvaney break down the key issues surrounding the president's buyout plan and other personnel moves.

A: The White House offered eight months of pay to people who quit, but labor unions have sued and warned workers that the deal is less than ironclad.

The unions' lawsuit argues that Congress has only funded the government through mid-March, so the administration doesn't have the authority to promise a pay package that extends until later in the year. A federal judge is considering whether to block the buyouts while the litigation continues.

The Office of Personnel Management, the government's human-resources agency, argues that its offer isn't subject to judicial review and is legally binding. If the government backtracks on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation, the office has said. It also said workers who agree to resign would be entitled to back pay if there is a shutdown from a lapse of appropriations.

The administration has suggested that workers who don't take the deal and voluntarily leave could be terminated as part of broad downsizing efforts. Federal laws and regulations set rules for mass layoffs. Agencies can eliminate jobs in bulk, even whole divisions, because of budget constraints or as part of a bureaucratic reorganization. But the layoffs can't be a pretext for replacing disfavored employees with other workers.

Is repeating someone's name charming — or creepy?

The tactic of repeating the names of people you meet, used by some to aid memory and others to get ahead, is encountering resistance from those who find it manipulative, condescending or just plain annoying.
