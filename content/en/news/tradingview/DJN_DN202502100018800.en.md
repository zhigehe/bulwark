The Australian dollar rises after data showed China's consumer inflation accelerated in January, boosted by prices of food and services ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The data help the commodity-linked currency to recover after falling earlier on U.S. President Trump's plans for 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. "The swift recovery in the Australian dollar was certainly due to the encouraging Chinese data that showed that inflation advanced to the highest level in five months." The Australian dollar rises 0.4% to $0.6268, having earlier fallen to a 6-day low of $0.6238, FactSet data show. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)
