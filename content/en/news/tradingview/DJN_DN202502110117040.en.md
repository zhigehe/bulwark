By Paul Ziobro

Pitney Bowes named Bob Gold as it next chief financial officer, effective March 10, tapping an outsider for its top finance job.

Gold succeeds John Witek, who has served as interim financial chief since March, the Stamford, Conn., shipping and mailing company said Tuesday.

Gold was most recently financial chief at EyeCare Partners, a national network of optometrists and ophthalmologists. He has also held the CEO at a number of other companies, including AM General, which makes the military Humvee vehicle; Culligan International; and United Plastics Group.

His appointment comes a few months after Pitney Bowes named Lance Rosenzweig as chief executive.
