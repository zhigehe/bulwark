DSM-Firmenich's 1 billion-euro buyback was a nice surprise, Barclays analysts write in a research note. In additiong, the nutrition, health and bioscience company's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization beat analysts expectations by 1.8%, they add. The only niggle was the miss to organic sales growth expectations in its taste, texture and health division, the analysts write. Fears around the 2% miss may be reduced if the company explains on its analyst call that momentum within the division remains strong, they write. DSM's underlying Ebitda guidance for 2025 of at least 2.45 billion euros shows constructive underlying performance, the analysts add. Shares rise 4% to 105.10 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)
