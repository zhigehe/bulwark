Capri Holdings shows "no clear evidence of a near-term turnaround," says BofA Securities in a note, adding that the stock will likely remain rangebound through 2026 which should be a transitional year for the company. Store closures and foreign exchange will negatively impact F2026 sales, and wholesale is expected to decline low double-digits, the analysts say. They also believe a sale of non-core brands Versace and Jimmy Choo would allow management to narrow its focus and allocate more resources to Michael Kors. BofA reinstates a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of $23 a share. Capri rises 3.5% to $22.44. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
