GoldHaven Resources (GOH.CN) on Monday said its 100%-owned Copecal Gold Project in Brazil holds "strong potential" for gold mineralization as it has a solid foundation of historic exploration data, favorable geological setting, and a systematic exploration strategy.

Exploration work conducted by AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU) from 2010 to 2016 had uncovered multiple gold-bearing anomalies.

"We view this as a highly compelling exploration venture within one of Brazil's most prolific gold belts. The depth of AngloGold's historical work has given us valuable insights into the underlying mineralization controls, positioning us to drive this project forward with precision and efficiency," said GoldHaven Chief Executive Bonn Smith. "Our goal is to continue advancing the Copecal Gold Project methodically, unlocking its full potential this year and into the future."

AngloGold's findings had also suggested that the Copecal Gold Project shared key geological characteristics with major gold deposits in the Juruena and Alta Floresta Gold Provinces.

The company expects a steady flow of updates and potential catalysts over the second and third quarters of 2025 as GOH develops the Copecal Gold Project.

Shares of GOH closed up $0.010 or 1.8%, to $0.58 on Friday on the Canadian Securities Exchange.
