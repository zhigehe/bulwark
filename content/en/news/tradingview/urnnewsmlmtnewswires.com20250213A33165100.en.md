Calian Group , a diverse products and services company, on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analyst expectations.

The company booked adjusted earnings of $10.5 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating the FactSet analyst consensus non-GAAP estimate of $0.70 per share.

Despite the beat, Calian's adjusted earnings were 25% down from $14 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, reported in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose to $185 million from $179.2 million and adjusted EBITDA sank to $17.8 million from $21.4 million.

"We closed the quarter as expected and are seeing positive momentum across our diverse end markets, while continuing to benefit from the strong contributions of our recent acquisitions in U.K., the U.S. and Canada," CEO Kevin Ford said.

The company reiterated its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance of $800 million to $880 million and adjusted EBITDA target of $96 million to $106 million.

Calian's share price fell 1.5% on Wednesday to $49.70 on the TSX.
