The discount of Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy crude to the North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) narrowed on Monday:

\* WCS for March delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, settled at $13.20 a barrel under WTI, according to brokerage CalRock, having ended at a $13.50 discount on Friday.

\* Canadian heavy crude prices have so far held up well in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs plan, analysts said.

\* Trump paused his plan to impose a 10% levy on Canadian oil for 30 days last week, in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement.

\* Canada exports approximately 4 million barrels of oil per day to the United States.

\* Globally, oil prices rose nearly 2% on Monday after posting their third straight week of losses, even though investors remained worried that U.S. President Donald Trump might start a trade war. Tariffs could dampen global economic growth and energy demand.
