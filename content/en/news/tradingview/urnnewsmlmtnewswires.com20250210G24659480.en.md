Kalina Power obtained two new sites in Alberta, Canada, expanding its secured land portfolio by 157% for the development of plants that can power AI data centers, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The company grew its secured landholding to 785 acres from 305 acres after obtaining site control in two locations in the Crossfield and Clairmont areas in Alberta.

The Crossfield site is priced at up to CA$15.2 million if purchased in the third year of the option period, while Clairmont is for at least CA$1.5 million. Both exclude agreed fees prior to the effectivity of a sale contract.

The clean-tech company's shares jumped nearly 13% in recent trade.
