The recently announced 25% tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel by US President Donald Trump are expected to lead to higher prices for US manufacturers as metal markets expect disruption, according to a Tuesday note from ANZ Research.

The US steel and aluminum industries will struggle to avoid the tariffs in the short term, according to the report.

The US has become reliant on imports to meet domestic consumption in aluminum and steel markets. The ability or incentive to build more domestic capacity will come at a greater cost than paying the extra cost in many cases.

The US is heavily reliant on aluminum imports. It consumes around 6 million tonnes, while its output fell from 2.6 million tonnes in 2014 on the back of the rising cost of electricity. It is expected to produce around 650,000 tonnes in 2025, compared with global output of 71 million tonnes.

Under 120,000 tonnes of Australian exports of around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminum find their way to the US. Australian aluminum exports to the US are not subject to levies due to exemptions secured in 2018.

Trade could also be rerouted under the levies, with more Canadian aluminum being exported to Europe and the US increasing its purchases from the Middle East. Canada is the biggest source of aluminum and steel imports for the US.

The US produces around 80 million tonnes of crude steel, falling short of its consumption needs by 25 million tonnes to 30 million tonnes. Its import reliance is around 12% to 15% of apparent consumption.

Australia exports a small amount of steel products to California and a big impact on Australian steel imports is not expected, according to the report.

Tariffs on steel imports also present a risk of weaker demand for iron ore, due to lower demand for China's steel exports.

Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum in 2018 during his first term.
