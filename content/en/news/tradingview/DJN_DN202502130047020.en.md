Sterling remains vulnerable even after U.K. economic data for the fourth quarter and December were better than expected, Monex Europe analysts say in a note. Increased U.K. government spending seems to have supported economic activity but this is an unsustainable method of sustaining growth in the longer term, they say. "It also leaves the Treasury with a headache." Treasury chief Rachel Reeves faces hard decisions for the March budget with her fiscal headroom likely having evaporated based on these latest figures. Sterling is at risk of falling in the coming months even if the U.K. outlook looks relatively more favorable compared to the EU. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
