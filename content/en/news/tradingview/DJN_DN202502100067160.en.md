Live cattle futures on the CME are up 0.6% early in trading, with the upward momentum coming amid a smaller figure for weekly slaughters than anticipated by livestock traders. "Weekly cattle slaughter totaled 584K head, a touch smaller than expected, down from 600K the prior week, and our smallest non-holiday week in almost a year," says StoneX in a note. The firm adds that a smaller total is now forecast for this week as well. Most-active lean hog futures are also higher early, trading up 0.3%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
