Oil edges higher in early Asian trade. Crude oil has rebounded recently amid signs of tightening supplies, ANZ Research analysts write in a note. Russian oil production fell short of its OPEC+ quota in January, easing oversupply concerns, they say. ANZ notes a report saying the Trump administration has put its peace plan for Ukraine on hold to include Europe in negotiations, adding to growing geopolitical risks. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are 0.1% higher at $72.37/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are 0.1% higher at $75.98/bbl. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
