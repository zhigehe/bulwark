Filecoin is having an important AMA to discuss changes to its fee structure. This change could impact how transactions are priced and therefore affect its network use and the token's value. If the adjustments reduce costs or add more functionality, it might attract more users, leading to potential growth in value. On the other hand, if the changes increase complexity or cost, they may push users away, resulting in a price drop. Investors should pay close attention to this event to gauge market reactions.
