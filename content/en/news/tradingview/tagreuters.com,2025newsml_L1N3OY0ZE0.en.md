Spot basis bids for corn and soybeans were unchanged in the U.S. Midwest on Friday, spot checks showed, amid a tepid trade ahead of the weekend.

\* Some buyers have purchased enough last month when multi-month CBOT corn (CH25) and soybean (SH25) futures climbed to multi-month highs and encouraged farmer selling.

\* Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybean and wheat futures weakened on Friday on renewed concerns over the risk for potential trade disputes to hurt demand for U.S. farm products, analysts said.

\* President [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. Grain traders worry that the duties may spark retaliation from importers that would dent U.S. crop sales.

\* Improved rains in Argentina helped drag down the markets after hot, dry weather in January, traders said. Showers this week delivered the country's soy crop "from the inferno," the Rosario grains exchange said.

\* Some farmers are waiting for higher prices before deciding to sell, dealers said.

\* CBOT March corn (CH25) was last down 8-1/4 cents to $4.87 a bushel and March soybeans (SH25) were down 11-1/2 cents to $10.49 a bushel.
