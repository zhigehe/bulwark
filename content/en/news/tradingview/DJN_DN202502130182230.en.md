With just a few days left before the Reserve Bank of Australia's first policy meeting for the year, money market traders have gone all in on the central bank delivering its first interest rate cut for the cycle. Money markets pricing now reflects a 100% probability of a cut, up from 85% midweek. The confident pricing comes despite media reports that the RBA board may be in two minds at the meeting. Albeit, the central bank can hang a cut on data showing a recent cooling in inflation, and its growing confidence that the three-year battle to tame price pressures will soon be over.
