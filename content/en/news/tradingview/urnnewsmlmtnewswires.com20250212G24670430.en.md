Telix Pharmaceuticals said that the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted marketing authorization for its prostate cancer imaging agent, Illuccix, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The approval allows for the detection and localization of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive lesions in adults with prostate cancer through positron emission tomography imaging, the filing said.

Illuccix will be distributed in the UK through Telix's partner, Xiel, a distributor of nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, and diagnostic radiology technologies.
