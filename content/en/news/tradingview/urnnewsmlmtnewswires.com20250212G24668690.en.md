Andrada Mining obtained a $2.5 million secured funding facility to support the construction of a second tin processing jig plant at its Uis mine in Namibia.

The loan will be provided by LC Abelheim, the trustee of the British tin producer's 15.81%-owner, The Orange Trust. The facility has a tenor of six months plus a fee of $50,000 per month, with Andrada to repay a total of $2.6 million in two tranches.

The funds aim to significantly boost tin processing capacity at the Uis site by an additional 100 tonnes per hour, as well as improve Andrada's cashflow.
