Digihost Technology (Nasdaq and TSXV: DGHI) rose 9.9% on Tuesday in U.S. pre-market trading after saying it formed a wholly owned unit called US Data Centers that will be dedicated to the development of high-performance computing (HPC) and data centers focused on artificial intelligence.

The unit will transform Digihost's existing site in Columbiana, Alabama into a state-of-the-art Tier 3 data center designed to support next-generation AI and HPC workloads.

US Data Centers' project is to be executed in two phases, with a total aggregate planned capacity of 55 MW, with the total capital expenditure for the project expected to be about $440 million.

Digihost Chief Executive Michel Amar commented: "The rapid growth of AI applications requires robust, high-performance infrastructure, and this strategic investment will help us meet that demand with a Tier 3-certified, AI-optimized facility designed for scalability and efficiency."

The company expects the first phase of the project will need capex of about $176 million and result in 22 MW of HPC capacity, with a target completion date of the second quarter of 2026. The second phase may need capex of about $264 million, and will consist of an additional 33 MW, with a target completion date during the first quarter of 2027, the company said.

U.S.-listed shares of the company were last seen up $0.30 at $3.34 in pre-market trading.
