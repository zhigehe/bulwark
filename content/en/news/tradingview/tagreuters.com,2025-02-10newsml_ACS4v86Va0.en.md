Civil Rights Leader Would Have Turned 100 This Year on Feb. 18, 2025

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / The Wing Luke Museum announced that it will host a community celebration to honor the legacy and contributions of Wing Chong Luke, a civil rights icon whose anti-discrimination, fair housing, Indigenous fishing rights, and cultural preservation work have indelibly shaped our region. Wing was the first person of color in King County and the first Chinese American elected to the Seattle City Council. Prior to his service on the City Council, Wing was also an assistant attorney general for the state of Washington.![](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-10:newsml_ACS4v86Va-fc88b8d8c1d4a0bd6df04297f3dce546-resized.jpeg)

The community celebration, which is part of year-long festivities, takes place at The Wing Luke Museum on Saturday, Feb. 15, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Museum also announced that for children ages 0-17, admission will be free on Friday, Feb. 14, through Sunday, Feb. 16, so families can learn about Wing Luke and his legacy. His birthday was Feb. 18, 1925.

During the community celebration, visitors will be able to view Wing Luke artifacts from the Museum's collection that include his City Council desk, photos from his early life and public service, illustrations, books, and personal items, as well as educational history banners about Wing Luke. Throughout the day, staff will hand out stickers, buttons, and light refreshments.

He was an attorney, served as Washington State assistant attorney general, and was the first Chinese American elected to the Seattle City Council. Wing Luke fought discrimination, advocated for fair housing, and supported Indigenous fishing rights.

While serving as Washington State's assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division from 1957-62 (Gov. Bob Ferguson formed the division and named it after Wing Luke in 2015), Wing participated in groundbreaking court cases. He was the lead attorney on the state's first antidiscrimination Cease & Desist order. He also represented the state (with others) in housing discrimination work that blew open the doors to fair housing in Washington. In 1967, The Wing Luke Museum was founded, named for him.

During his time, Wing also argued for preserving some of Seattle's most iconic historic sites, including the historic Pike Place Market, the Central Seattle Waterfront and the Pioneer Square neighborhood. His work to preserve these sites not only retained culture but also continue to be major economic drivers for small businesses and state and city tourism. Information on events and goings-on in celebration of Wing Luke will be announced via our social media pages, e-news and website.
