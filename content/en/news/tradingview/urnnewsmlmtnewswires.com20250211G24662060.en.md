Chuzhou Duoli Automotive Technology said its subsidiaries, Kunshan Daya and Shanghai Dolly, received supply commitments from multiple domestic automakers, according to a Tuesday filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

Kunshan Daya will supply integrated die-casting parts for two leading EV manufacturers, while both subsidiaries will provide hot-formed parts for seven automotive firms.

Production is expected to start in 2025-2026, with estimated sales of 1.3 billion yuan to 1.5 billion yuan over three years. However, actual supply volumes remain uncertain due to market conditions.
