\*\* Shares in France's GTT fall as much as 7.3% after the engineering group's CEO Jean-Baptiste Choimet resigned

\*\* The group also announced cost cutting measures at its unit Elogen and suspension of construction at its gigafactory in Vendome, and forecast 2024 group revenue and core profit in the upper range of its previous guidance

\*\* Considering sector weakness and GTT's historic willingness to reduce spending, while the announcement is not too surprising, it is a significant one, Portzamparc says in a note

\*\* The broker cuts GTT to "hold" citing governance uncertainties and limited upside to the stock's valuation, expecting its profits to peak in 2025

\*\* The Paris-listed stock is down 3.9% by 0847 GMT to the bottom of Europe-wide STOXX 600 index

\*\* If losses hold, it will see its worst day since August
