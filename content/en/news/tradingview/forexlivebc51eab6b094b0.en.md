There are a couple to take note of on the board for today, as highlighted in bold.

The first ones are for EUR/USD at the 1.0300 and 1.0350 levels. The pair opened with a gap lower today amid a stronger dollar from tariff fears, again. But we're seeing price action slowly eat into the gap now and sitting just above 1.0300 again.

The large expiries at the figure level might lock any downside in the session ahead, with Trump headlines set to take a breather in European trading at least. Meanwhile, the ones at 1.0350 might not offer too much as key near-term resistance from the 100 and 200-hour moving averages close to 1.0368 now is the more crucial point on the charts. So, that will lock down any topside momentum to start the new week.

Then, there is one for USD/JPY at 151.50, which doesn't offer much of any technical significance. As such, I wouldn't expect the expiries to be too impactful with key resistance around 152.68-70 (confluence of the 100 and 200-day moving averages) being the more pivotal point on the charts.
