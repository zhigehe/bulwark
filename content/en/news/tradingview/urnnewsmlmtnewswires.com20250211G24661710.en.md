Baader Helvea Equity Research on Monday cut Ems-Chemie's price target while making slight downward revisions to its estimates for 2025 and 2026, citing a "disappointing" sales guidance.

The Swiss polymer and specialty chemicals company said it expects 2025 sales to be below the prior-year level due to currency effects. Baader Helvea estimates a marginally negative foreign exchange impact and a 3.2% decline in prices in 2025 for Ems-Chemie, with a roughly flat topline and profit in the first half.

At the same time, the analyst reiterated its reduce rating on the stock.

"EMS will continue to outgrow the market also in Europe through continuous product innovation and additionally profit from a further recovering consumer-related demand. Additionally, we expect EMS to expand its sales share in healthcare applications through launches in e.g. injection pens, pipettes and bioreactors, which should be also slightly margin accretive," the research firm wrote.
