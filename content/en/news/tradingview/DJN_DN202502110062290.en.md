Inflation cooled down slightly in Brazil last month, but not enough to relief pressure on the central bank. Brazil's 12-month IPCA consumer price index was 4.6% in January, compared to 4.8% in December, the country's statistics agency IBGE says. The central bank's target is 3%, with a tolerance range of 1.5 percentage point. "The inflationary pressures remain strong, particularly among services, and goods inflation is normalizing upwards from low-levels," Goldman Sachs' Alberto Ramos writes. The central bank will need to remain hawkish, he says. The central bank's policy rate is at 13.25% and widely expected to keep rising. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
