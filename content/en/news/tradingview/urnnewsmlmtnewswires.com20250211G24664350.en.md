Kingsmen Creatives said its Malaysian subsidiary has filed to transfer a civil suit to the Shah Alam High Court, pending determination, according to a Tuesday filing on the Singapore Exchange.

The lawsuit, initiated by JKC Engineering, is currently before the High Court of Malaya in Johor Bahru. Kingsmen Projects submitted its defense on Dec. 31, while two individuals, Lim Tian Siong and Simon Ong Chin Sim, filed their responses on Feb. 7.

Kingsmen Projects filed the transfer request on Jan. 7, arguing that the Shah Alam High Court is the more appropriate forum. Both parties have since submitted affidavits in response, with JKC filing on Jan. 22 and Kingsmen Projects on Feb. 6.
