\*\* DoorDash beat estimates for Q4 revenue and total orders on Tuesday, as customers turned to its online platform to buy everything from food and groceries to alcohol during the holiday season

\*\* Shares rise 6.6% to $205.7 premarket with at least five brokerages raising price target on stock

\*\* DASH rated "buy" on average by 45 brokerages; median PT is $210 - LSEG

PROFITABILITY TO RAMP ON ROBUST ENGAGEMENT

\*\* Citigroup ("buy"; PT: $240) believes that with expanding EBITDA margins, positive international gross profit and grocery unit economics nearing break-even, profitability can ramp significantly going forward

\*\* Morningstar (fair value: $179) says DASH is growing faster than all e-delivery competitors, driven by ability to retain and monetize users

\*\* Piper Sandler ("neutral"; PT: $210) says impressed by management's execution and ability to expand into new verticals like grocery and retail

\*\* Roth Capital Partners ("neutral"; PT: $193) expects company to be included in the S&P 500 index as early as June this year

\*\* BTIG ("buy"; PT: $225) says while expectations were high going into the release, DASH showed enough to support bullish buy-side expectations
