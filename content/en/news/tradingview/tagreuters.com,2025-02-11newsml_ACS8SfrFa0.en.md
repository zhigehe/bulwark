NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 / Originally published on Aflac Newsroom

If there's one thing fans and media have learned by now, it's to always expect the unexpected with University of Colorado Head Football Coach Deion "Coach Prime" Sanders. Known for keeping things interesting, like being the only athlete to play in both the Super Bowl and the World Series, Coach Prime never misses a chance to surprise.

On Sept. 17, at the news conference leading to the Colorado vs. Baylor showdown, Coach Prime added another twist. In honor of National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, he introduced 8-year-old cancer survivor and lifelong Buffs fan, Piper Lardes, as the Aflac Supplemental Coach of the Game.

Piper, a true Buffs fan through and through, took a few questions from reporters with confidence and shared how excited she was to team up with Aflac and Coach Prime to help support the Buffs in their upcoming game. Sporting her Blenders sunglasses and wrapping up with a heartfelt "Sko Buffs!," Piper stole the show.

Piper's connection with Coach Prime goes back to this past summer when they met at a children's hospital during a My Special Aflac Duck® delivery, but Piper's journey started much earlier. At just 4 years old, she began experiencing unexplained arm pain, which led to an emergency MRI. On Halloween 2020, she was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare tumor pressing against her spinal cord.

After enduring 28 weeks of biweekly chemotherapy and 31 days of radiation, Piper was declared cancer-free. Today, she enjoys reading, playing softball and helping raise awareness for pediatric cancer. She even had the chance to do just that during the first quarter of the Colorado vs. Baylor game on Sept. 21.

On the field, Piper wore the first-of-its-kind Aflac-branded coaching staff custom headset that coordinated with the team's helmets. Piper and her family were honored on Folsom Field, where her story was shared with fans. The stadium erupted in applause and cheers when it was announced that Piper is now cancer-free. Fans congratulated her and took photos with her as she made her way to her seat.

As the Aflac Supplemental Coach of the Game, Piper now boasts a perfect 1-0 coaching record after the Buffs fought hard and clinched a thrilling overtime victory against Baylor. It's a game - and an experience - Piper and her family will never forget.

These memorable moments serve as powerful reminders about the importance of supporting children with cancer. Watch below for a special message from Piper to Team Aflac.
