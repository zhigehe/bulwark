**Challenges and Risks**

**Challenges and Risks**: The company faces intense competition across all aspects of its business, which could negatively impact profitability. The financial services market is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes due to technological innovation and evolving regulations. New market entrants with greater resources may offer more attractive products, leading to pricing pressures and reduced revenue growth.

The variability in assets under custody/administration and management, due to large institutional clients, poses a risk. The loss or gain of a significant client can materially affect financial results. Additionally, large clients exert considerable market influence, leading to fee pressures.

Development of new products, particularly in fintech and digital assets, involves significant costs and dependencies on third parties, exposing the company to increased risks. The introduction of new products requires substantial resources and may not yield expected benefits.

Acquisitions and strategic alliances present integration risks, including potential underperformance and challenges in achieving anticipated benefits. The company may face difficulties in retaining clients and talent from acquired businesses, which could impact financial objectives.

The company is exposed to political, geopolitical, and economic risks, which could lead to market volatility and affect financial stability. Global operations are susceptible to disruptions from geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue and operational costs.

**Financial Market Risks**: The investment securities portfolio is subject to risks from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market conditions. Regulatory liquidity standards require maintaining high-quality liquid assets, impacting net interest income and margins.

The company assumes significant credit risk from counterparties, including major financial institutions, which could lead to financial loss. Concentrated counterparty exposure and settlement risks in payments and foreign exchange activities present additional challenges.

**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**: Management acknowledges the challenges posed by regulatory changes and competitive pressures. Strategies include focusing on innovation and expanding product offerings to mitigate risks. The company is also enhancing risk management frameworks to address geopolitical and market uncertainties.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**: The company is exposed to interest rate risk, which affects net interest income and margins. Changes in global interest rates and currency fluctuations could impact financial results. The company employs hedging strategies to manage these risks but acknowledges potential volatility in outcomes.
