By Dominic Chopping

Unilever will demerge its ice cream business and list it in Amsterdam, London and New York, ending months of speculation over how the company would move ahead with previously announced plans to separate the business.

The consumer-goods giant announced plans to carve out the business nearly 12 months ago as it has a different operating model to the rest of the group.

Unilever's ice cream business--which includes the Ben & Jerry's, Magnum and Wall's brands--generated turnover of 8.3 billion euros ($8.62 billion) in 2024.

Unilever said its underlying sales grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.1% expected by analysts in a company-compiled consensus, while sales volumes grew for the fifth consecutive quarter.

Under Chief Executive Hein Schumacher, the company is working through a turnaround plan that includes the ice cream spin-off and cost-cutting measures that will shed 7,500 jobs globally.
