Health care stocks were flat to higher pre-bell Monday as the iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB) was inactive and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) was up 0.2% recently.

Pliant Therapeutics shares declined by over 62% after the company said it has suspended enrollment and treatment in a phase 2b trial of bexotegrast for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following a recommendation from the trial's data safety monitoring board.
