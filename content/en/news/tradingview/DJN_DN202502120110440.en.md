By Anthony Harrup

U.S. natural gas inventories probably decreased by less than average last week as a milder start to February curbed demand, particularly for heating in the residential and commercial sectors, while production picked up after January freeze-offs.

Gas in underground storage is expected to have fallen by 96 billion cubic feet to 2,301 Bcf in the week ended Feb. 7, according to the average estimate of 11 analysts, brokers and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Forecasts range from a withdrawal of 82 Bcf to a withdrawal of 118 Bcf.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration is scheduled to report weekly natural gas inventories on Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EST.

The predicted draw is smaller than the five-year average for the week of 144 Bcf, and would reduce the deficit against the 2020-2024 average to 63 Bcf from 111 Bcf the week before. A return of below-normal temperatures across much of the U.S. this week and next are expected to widen the deficit in subsequent weeks.

Last week's expected drawdown would leave natural gas stocks 244 Bcf below their level of a year ago, when an exceptionally mild winter kept a lid on demand.
