MEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 13, 2025--

FIBRA Macquarie México (FIBRAMQ) (BMV: FIBRAMQ12) announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024.

FOURTH QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS

* Solid same store NOI portfolio performance with Industrial portfolio up 6.7% (US Dollars, YoY) and Retail portfolio up 4.3% (Mexican Pesos, YoY)
* Industrial portfolio Leased GLA of 30.4 million square feet, steady QoQ and YoY
* Retail portfolio closing occupancy of 93.3%, steady QoQ and up 130 bps YoY
* 4Q24 cash distribution of Ps. 0.5250 per certificate declared

"We had a productive year in 2024 as we continued to execute on our disciplined growth strategy, of maximizing NOI in our operating portfolio, while selectively investing in new industrial developments to increase our NAV and grow our total returns," said Simon Hanna, FIBRA Macquarie's chief executive officer. "For the year, we delivered solid earnings growth as we achieved record AFFO at the top end of our guidance range. Our well-located retail portfolio has demonstrated ongoing progress, with solid retention rates and growing occupancy contributing to strong NOI growth. We are pleased to be starting to see the contribution from our industrial development program, including two new developments that we leased during the year. Furthermore, as we move into 2025, our scheduled lease expirations are below historical averages, which provides us with additional resiliency and earnings visibility as we observe a shift in the shorter-term macro-outlook."

Mr. Hanna continued, "Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the positive long-term dynamics in Mexico. While there is currently heightened political and tariff uncertainty, we believe that Mexico will continue to be a strategic component of the regional and global supply chain overt the long term, and that FIBRAMQ is well positioned given our portfolio composition and prudent balance sheet, providing us with both flexibility and stability."

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

FIBRAMQ continues to pursue a strategy of investing in and developing class "A" industrial assets in core markets that demonstrate strong performance and a positive economic outlook.

Industrial Portfolio Growth Capex Program

FIBRAMQ has 0.6 million square feet of GLA under development or stabilization. In addition, FIBRAMQ is advancing for the obtention of relevant permits and licenses with respect to its recent Guadalajara project, and expects to start construction on the first building in this park comprising 330 thousand square feet of GLA in the second half of 2025.

The forecast 2025 cash investment for the industrial development program is expected to be in a range of US$50.0 million to US$100.0 million. FIBRAMQ will remain disciplined in its capital deployment as it completes developments in process and stabilizes recent deliveries, while being opportunistic to maintain a future growth pipeline. FIBRA Macquarie maintains a target NOI yield on cost of between 9% and 11%, which incorporates the highest sustainability standards and is designed to generate embedded operational efficiencies for its customers.

Projects in process are summarized below. For further details regarding recently delivered projects, please refer to the Supplementary Information materials located at BMV Filings (fibramacquarie.com).

FIBRAMQ's indebtedness is 99.4% fixed rate, with 3.7 years of weighted average tenor remaining.

FIBRAMQ does not have any loans maturing before September 2026.

As of December 31, 2024, FIBRAMQ's CNBV regulatory debt to total asset ratio was 30.3% and debt service coverage ratio was 5.8x.

CERTIFICATE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

FIBRAMQ has a Ps. 1,000 million CBFI repurchase-for-cancellation program available through to June 25, 2025. No certificates were repurchased during the quarter.

SUSTAINABILITY

At December 31, 2024, FIBRA Macquarie's green building certification coverage represented 41.8% of consolidated GLA, representing an increase of 213bps YoY.

The sustainability and green financing linked portion of drawn debt stands at 63.0%.

During the fourth quarter, FIBRAMQ obtained a second LEED(R) v4 C&S Platinum certification, for its 211 thousand square foot development property in Monterrey.

DISTRIBUTION

FIBRAMQ declared a cash distribution of Ps. 0.5250 per certificate for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The distribution is expected to be paid on or about March 13, 2025, to holders of record on March 12, 2025. FIBRAMQ's certificates are expected to commence trading ex-distribution on March 12, 2025.

FY25 GUIDANCE

FIBRAMQ maintains a cautious outlook on operational performance for 2025, and this guidance assumes no material deterioration of the geopolitical landscape or Mexico's key trading relationships.

FIBRAMQ has a record-low level of annual scheduled lease expirations in its Industrial portfolio, with FY25 lease roll-over comprising 11.4% of Industrial portfolio annualized base rents. On an overall basis, FIBRAMQ anticipates lease renewals in its industrial portfolio to achieve weighted average positive leasing spreads of approximately 10%.

Revenue and NOI growth for the consolidated portfolio is expected to be partly offset by the financing costs of near-term investments in FIBRAMQ's industrial growth capex program, which is expected to contribute to additional revenue and AFFO growth from FY26 onwards.

AFFO

FIBRAMQ is initiating FY25 AFFO guidance in a range of between Ps. 2.95 and Ps. 3.05 per certificate.

The FY25 AFFO guidance equates to a range of US$115 million to US$119 million, representing an annual increase of between 1% and 5% in underlying USD terms.

This guidance assumes:

* an average exchange rate of Ps. 20.50 per US dollar for FY25;
* no new acquisitions or divestments;
* no issuances or repurchases of certificates; and
* no deterioration in broader economic and market conditions, including the potential implementation of tariffs or deterioration in the trade relationship with key trading partners

Cash Distribution

FIBRAMQ is initiating guidance for cash distributions in FY25 of Ps. 2.45 per certificate, expected to be paid in equal quarterly installments.

The FY25 cash distribution guidance equates to approximately US$95m, representing an annual increase for scheduled distributions of 4.2% in underlying USD terms.

The guidance implies an expected FY25 AFFO payout ratio of approximately 82%, based on the AFFO guidance midpoint.

The payment of distributions is subject to the approval of the Manager, stable market conditions and prudent management of FIBRAMQ's capital position.

Outstanding certificates

FIBRA Macquarie had 797,311,397 outstanding certificates as of December 31, 2024. This considers the 36.0 million certificates issuance to existing holders that was made in March 2024 in respect of the extraordinary distribution corresponding to FY23, resulting in a 4.7% increase in outstanding CBFIs.
