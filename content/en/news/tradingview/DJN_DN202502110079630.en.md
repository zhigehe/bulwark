By Adriano Marchese

Parkland shares rose Tuesday after Ontario's provincial court found that Simpson Oil, its largest investor, is no longer bound by the voting and standstill restrictions.

Shares traded 13% higher at 37.74 Canadian dollars ($26.36).

The two parties have been involved in a legal dispute regarding their governance agreement when in August of last year, Simpson Oil, which owns 19.8% of Parkland, began an application with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking a declaration that the standstill and voting restrictions no longer applied.

Simpson Oil has also pushed for a strategic review which could include a potential sale of the business.

Parkland said Tuesday that it remains focused on acting in the best interests of all shareholders to maximize value and executing its long-term strategy, and that it will continue to engage with shareholders.
