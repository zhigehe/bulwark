Construction activity in Malaysia expanded by 23.1% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, accelerating from 22.9% growth in the third quarter and marking the eleventh consecutive period of growth.

It was also the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2022, boosted by a sharp acceleration in output for both residential (38.9% vs 27.8% in Q3) and special trade activities (44.9% vs 42.6%).

Meanwhile, non-residential (24.6% vs 27.7%) buildings and civil engineering (9.3% vs 12%) moderated, though both continued to contribute positively to the countryâ€™s construction growth.
