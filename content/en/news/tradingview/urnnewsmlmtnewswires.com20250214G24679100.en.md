NatWest Group said Friday its profit for the full year 2024 rose, while total income fell year over year.

Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 4.52 billion pounds sterling, compared with 4.39 billion pounds a year ago. EPS moved to 0.531 pound from 0.477 pound.

The British lender's total income was 14.70 billion pounds, compared with 14.75 billion pounds earlier.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 14.57 billion pounds in sales, 4.25 billion pounds in net income, and 0.50 pound in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board proposed a final dividend of 0.155 pound per share for the period, payable on April 28 to shareholders on record March 14. It paid 0.115 pound per share a year ago. The final dividend takes the full-year 2024 dividend to 0.215 pound per share, up from 0.17 pound per share in 2023.
