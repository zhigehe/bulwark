HARRISBURG, Pa., Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — RxTechExam and the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association (PPA) have announced a strategic partnership aimed at addressing upcoming pharmacy technician regulations in Pennsylvania through a comprehensive, online training solution. This collaboration is designed to provide a seamless pathway for pharmacy technicians to achieve certification and meet new regulatory requirements.

With pending legislation from the Pennsylvania Board of Pharmacy that mandates the completion of an approved technician training program, the partnership seeks to bridge the gap between current practices and future regulations. As part of this initiative, PPA members and their affiliated pharmacies will gain access to discounted training for their staff. Additionally, students who successfully complete the program will receive a one-year PPA technician membership to support their continued growth in the field.
