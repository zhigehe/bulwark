Iron ore prices for cargoes with 62% iron content rose to nearly $107 per ton in mid-February, marking a four-month high.

This increase was driven by a strong short-term demand outlook, as steel production in China resumed following the Lunar New Year holidays.

Supply disruptions in key producers like Australia also contributed a risk premium to iron ore prices.

Despite these factors, markets appeared to overlook the latest tariff measures from the US. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions," raising concerns about a potential escalation of the global trade war.
