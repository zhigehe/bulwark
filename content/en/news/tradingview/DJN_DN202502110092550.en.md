By Stuart Condie

SYDNEY--Commonwealth Bank raised its first-half profit by 6.1% as Australia's largest bank lifted lending volumes and cut loan impairments despite pressure on consumers and businesses from inflation and elevated interest rates.

The lender on Wednesday reported a net profit for the six months through December of 5.13 billion Australian dollars, or about US$3.22 billion. Revenue rose by 3.8% to A$14.10 billion.

The average analyst forecast had been for a statutory net profit of A$5.05 billion, according to data compiled by Visible Alpha.

The board lifted the interim dividend to A$2.25 from A$2.15, slightly ahead of the A$2.24 expected by analysts.

Operating expenses rose 6.0% to A$6.37 billion, with the bank citing wage inflation, technology spending, and investment in artificial intelligence and data infrastructure. This was offset by productivity initiatives, it added.
