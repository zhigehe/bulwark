Sterling rises after the latest U.K. economic growth data came in better than expected. The economy grew 0.4% on month in December, beating the 0.1% forecast by economists in a WSJ survey. In the fourth quarter, the economy expanded 0.1% on quarter. Despite exceeding expectations, economic momentum remains "dismal," Pepperstone strategist Michael Brown says in a note. The fourth-quarter figures reinforce the case for 2025 to be a year of stagflation where the economy experiences stagnant growth, stubbornly high inflation and elevated unemployment, he says. The Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates more rapidly. GBP/USD rises to a one-week high of 1.2517 after the data from 1.2489 beforehand. EUR/GBP falls to 0.8336 from 0.8352.
