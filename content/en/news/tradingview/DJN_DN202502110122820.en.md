NY Fed President John Williams says measures of housing inflation are partly responsible for his forecast that overall inflation is likely to finish 2025 around 2.5%, somewhat above the Fed's 2% target. With housing disinflation, "it took longer to get that process going," and therefore it will take a while yet for slower housing price increases to translate into a less inflationary addition to the overall figure. Another stubborn inflation metric, core services inflation excluding housing, is set to continue making gradual progress too, Williams tells a group of reporters.
