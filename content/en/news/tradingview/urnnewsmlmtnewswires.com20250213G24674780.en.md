Urban Logistics REIT said Thursday it completed new lease agreements for five properties totaling 301,000 square feet since the end of September 2024.

The new lettings will deliver an annual headline rental income of 3 million pounds sterling, of which 1.3 million pounds from two units purchased in September 2024 and 1.7 million pounds from previously-tenanted assets.

The deals reduce the real estate investment trust's portfolio vacancy to 6.2%, compared with 8.1% at the end of September 2024.
