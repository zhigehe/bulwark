Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc. recently released its preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company, which specializes in auto transportation and logistics services, provided a detailed overview of its performance for the three months ending December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

**Financial Highlights**

Proficient Auto Logistics reported a total operating revenue of $95.1 million for Q4 2024, marking a 4% increase from Q3 2024 but a 15.9% decrease from Q4 2023. The company experienced a total operating loss of $1.9 million, an improvement from the $2.2 million loss in Q3 2024 but a significant decline from the $9.4 million operating income in Q4 2023. Adjusted operating income stood at $1.7 million, up from $1.1 million in Q3 2024 but down from $9.4 million in Q4 2023. The adjusted operating ratio improved slightly to 98.3% from 98.8% in Q3 2024.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The company delivered 521,476 units in Q4 2024, a 4% increase from Q3 2024 but a 4% decrease from Q4 2023. Revenue per unit for company deliveries was $179.22, down from $193.53 in Q4 2023. Revenue per unit for subhaulers was $163.49, a significant drop from $198.59 in Q4 2023. The decline in revenue per unit reflects a lower spot buy opportunity and reduced price premiums for spot buys.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Proficient Auto Logistics completed its initial public offering (IPO) on May 13, 2024, and subsequently acquired five operating businesses. The company also acquired Auto Transport Group (ATG) on August 16, 2024. These acquisitions have been integrated into the company's financial reporting.

**Management's Perspective**

Rick O’Dell, Proficient’s Chief Executive Officer, commented on the company's performance, stating, "Proficient navigated through a continuing weak industry environment during the fourth quarter, achieving top line growth of 4% compared to the previous quarter and improving adjusted operating ratio by 50 basis points quarter over quarter. We continue to build an integrated national operating foundation that we are confident will serve us well as the market begins to rebound."

**Future Outlook**

The company provided preliminary financial results for Q4 2024, which are subject to completion and audit. These results reflect management's current views and may change as a result of continued review and audit procedures. The company will host an investor conference call to discuss the results and provide further insights into its future outlook.
