Legrand's guidance for 2025 isn't very clear as it doesn't provide specific organic growth targets, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The French electrical and digital building infrastructure manufacturer posted solid fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted profit results ahead of consensus estimates. North America was the standout, growing 12.9%, compared to consensus of 5.7%, the analysts say. Legrand guides for total revenue growth of 6% to 10%, including organic and scope--focused on growth related to acquisitions--. Consensus estimates see organic growth above 4% and scope above 3%, Jefferies says. Shares trade 8% higher at 104.9 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)
