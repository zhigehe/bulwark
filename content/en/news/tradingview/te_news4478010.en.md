The yield on the 10-year Swiss government bond has risen to 0.41%, its highest since late January, aligning with US Treasury yields after a hot US CPI report supported a hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve.

Meanwhile, the Swiss annual inflation rate eased to a near four-year low of 0.4% in January, closer to the lower limit of the SNB's 0-2% definition for price stability.

Still, the core gauge unexpectedly increased to 0.9% from 0.7% in December, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures may be stronger than initially forecast if this trend continues.

Inflation is expected to remain very low this year, with the central bank forecasting average consumer-price growth of just 0.3%.

In December, the SNB cut interest rates by 50 basis points and signaled the possibility of additional cuts, potentially pushing rates into negative territory.

A further reduction in interest rates might deter currency appreciation pressures, supporting export competitiveness for Swiss companies.
