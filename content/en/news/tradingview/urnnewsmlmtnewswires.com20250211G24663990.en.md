Bayer secured the European Commission's approval for Beyonttra, or acoramidis, for treating wild-type or variant transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in adults.

The marketing authorization is supported by the late-stage ATTRibute-CM study, which demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality or first cardiovascular hospitalization by 36% and annualized cardiovascular hospitalizations by 50% at 30 months, compared with placebo, according to a Tuesday statement.

The German pharmaceutical company plans to launch Beyonttra in Europe in the first half of 2025, following its approval in the US in November 2024. The drug was developed by BridgeBio Pharma, which holds the marketing rights in the US.
