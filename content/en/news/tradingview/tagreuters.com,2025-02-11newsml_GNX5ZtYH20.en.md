SEATTLE, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (“Adaptive Biotechnologies”) , a commercial stage biotechnology company that aims to translate the genetics of the adaptive immune system into clinical products to diagnose and treat disease, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.

“2024 was a year of strong execution, marked by key catalysts achieved in our MRD business and advancements in our Immune Medicine programs. Our MRD revenue grew by 42%, with a 35% increase in clonoSEQ test volume, and we nominated a lead autoimmune indication within our Immune Medicine business,” said Chad Robins, chief executive officer and co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies. “With strong momentum heading into 2025, we are focused on achieving profitability in MRD, advancing our therapeutics pipeline in Immune Medicine, and maintaining a durable cash position to support sustainable, long-term growth.”

**Recent Highlights**

* Revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 was $47.5 million and $179.0 million, respectively. The MRD business, which contributed 85% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 81% of revenue in the full year, grew 31% and 42% over the corresponding periods a year ago.
* clonoSEQ® test volume increased 34% to 20,945 tests delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter 2023 and ended the year with 76,105 tests delivered, up 35% versus 2023.
* Obtained updated Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) Gapfill Determination for clonoSEQ of $2,007 per test, a 17% increase from the previous implied rate under the episode structure.
* The FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted unanimously in favor of the use of MRD as a primary endpoint to support the accelerated approval of new therapies for patients with multiple myeloma.
* Received expanded Medicare coverage of clonoSEQ for assessing measurable residual disease in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), enabling initiation of MCL promotional efforts.
* Signed an exclusive strategic commercial partnership with NeoGenomics to cross-promote our clonoSEQ® test along with NeoGenomics’ COMPASS® and CHART® hematopathology services.
* Completed multiple antibody mouse immunization campaigns in prioritized autoimmune indications and functionally tested a subset of selected antibodies to a number of disease-causing targets in these indications.
* Nominated a lead autoimmune indication to further advance on the preclinical development of antibody therapeutic candidates in this first autoimmune indication.

**About Adaptive Biotechnologies**

Adaptive Biotechnologies (“we” or “our”) is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature’s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed. We apply our platform to partner with biopharmaceutical companies, inform drug development, and develop clinical diagnostics across our two business segments: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and Immune Medicine. Our commercial products and clinical pipeline enable the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.

**Forward-Looking Statements**

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. All statements contained in this release other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our ability to develop, commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our current and planned products and services, our research and development efforts and other matters regarding our business strategies, use of capital, results of operations and financial position and plans and objectives for future operations.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors are described under "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. We caution you that forward-looking statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. As a result, the forward-looking statements may not prove to be accurate. The forward-looking statements in this press release represent our views as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure**

To supplement our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and unaudited consolidated balance sheets, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), this press release also includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation adjusted for interest and other income, net, interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment costs for long-lived assets, restructuring expense and share-based compensation expense. We define our segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same way to the extent the net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation and adjustments are allocable to each segment. We have provided reconciliations of net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of this press release.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate the financial performance of our business and segments and to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. We present these figures because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and it facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes items that are not indicative of our core operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments we make. In particular, we expect to incur meaningful share-based compensation expense in the future. Other limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, does not reflect:

* all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
* changes in our working capital needs;
* interest expense, which is an ongoing element of our costs to operate;
* income tax (expense) benefit, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;
* the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated and amortized, which will often have to be replaced in the future;
* the noncash component of employee compensation expense;
* long-lived assets impairment costs; and
* the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, such as our restructuring activities and reductions in workforce.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.
