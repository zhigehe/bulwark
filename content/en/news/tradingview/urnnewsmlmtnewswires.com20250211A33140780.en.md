U.S. crude oil inventories are projected to have risen 7.2 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 7, lower than the increase of 8.7 million barrels recorded in the previous week, Macquarie said in a Monday note.

Net imports are expected to have fallen week-over-week, with a decrease of 9.9 million barrels per day in exports and a decline of 1.2 million barrels/d in imports, Macquarie noted.

Domestic supply is seen to have edged lower by 0.1 million b/d while the strategic petroleum reserve inventory gained 0.2 million barrels, according to Macquarie.

Among products, Macquarie expects gasoline to have increased by 0.6 million barrels and jet fuel by about 0.7 million barrels. Meanwhile, distillate is projected to have declined by 2.1 million barrels.

Implied demand for these three products was forecast at 13.9 million b/d.
