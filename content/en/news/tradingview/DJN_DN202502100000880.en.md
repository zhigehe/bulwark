Developments related to U.S. tariffs remain a major factor for Asian equities, Nomura analysts led by Chetan Seth say in a commentary. The Trump administration's pause on tariffs levied on small packages last Friday could bring some added relief to Chinese equities, alongside continued optimism from the DeepSeek theme, the analysts say. Risk assets have taken a hit following Trump's announcement that he would impose "reciprocal tariffs on many countries," Nomura adds. The overhang relating to broader tariffs should keep risk appetite toward Asian stocks in check, the investment bank says. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
