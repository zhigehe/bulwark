Ragnar Metals said the reprocessing of very low-frequency geophysics survey data from the Viken project in Sweden identified several anomalies, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

The anomalies were coincident with polymetallic mineralization intersected in previous drilling and represent the highest-priority areas for potential uranium-vanadium-molybdenum-bearing alum shale.

Historical geophysical data was obtained by GeoVista Consultants, who performed extensive reprocessing and filtering to generate a series of images.

The firm plans to plans to advance 3D modeling work and evaluate the application of additional electromagnetic techniques to further refine exploration over the identified high-priority areas.
