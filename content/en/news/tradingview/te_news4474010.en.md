The offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.31 per dollar, weighed down by a stronger US dollar as President Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.

The move, which also encompasses finished metal products, aims to address what the Trump administration describes as attempts by countries like Russia and China to bypass existing duties.

This decision adds to existing trade tensions, with Trump's administration already imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% levies on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are currently on hold, along with plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs on other countries.

In retaliation, China imposed new tariffs on US imports, including 15% on coal and LNG and 10% on crude oil, agricultural equipment, and vehicles, effective February 10,Â 2025.

Chinese authorities also launched an anti-monopoly probe into Google and added PVH, parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, to its "unreliable entity" list.
