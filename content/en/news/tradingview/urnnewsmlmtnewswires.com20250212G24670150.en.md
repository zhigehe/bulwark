Pharma Foods International will establish Cadasil Drug Discovery Research Department in collaboration with the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Cadasil, a genetic vascular disease with no established cure, is linked to NOTCH3 gene mutations, leading to migraines, strokes, and dementia.

The National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, a research institute for cardiovascular diseases, is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials on adrenomedullin peptide as a potential treatment.

Pharma Foods will apply its expertise in peptide research to develop new therapies for the disease, aligning with its broader mission of advancing healthcare innovations.
