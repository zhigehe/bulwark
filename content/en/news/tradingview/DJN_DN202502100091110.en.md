Lyft's recent revenue growth could be unsustainable due to shifting labor market conditions and reduced driver incentives, Third Bridge analyst Albie Amankona says in a research note. The ride-hailing app is facing mounting pressure in its core ridesharing business, and it isn't expected to regain significant market share against Uber Technologies anytime soon, Amankona adds. Overall, Lyft's biggest growth opportunity lies in media advertising, or a potential deal with Amazon.com. "An acquisition of Lyft could give Amazon a major boost in the autonomous vehicle race." Owning Lyft would give Amazon more control over pricing and competition, especially against rivals like Waymo. Plus, integrating Lyft could enhance Amazon's existing businesses, like Prime and Whole Foods, creating a new ecosystem for cross-promotion, Amankona adds. Lyft shares rise 5.5%, with Amazon shares up 2%. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
