U.S. Treasurys trade little changed in early European hours after President Trump ordered federal agencies on Thursday to explore how to adjust U.S. tariffs to match of those of other countries. Treasurys rallied Thursday, fully reversing Wednesday's CPI-triggered selloff. That said, Trump's tariffs measures continue to hang over markets. "The threat of those reciprocal tariffs, plus apparent upcoming announcements on further tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceutical products will thus hang over proceedings like the 'sword of Damocles' for a while yet," says Pepperstone's Michael Brown in a note. This creates choppy trading conditions and higher volatility, the senior research strategist says. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield last trades 2 basis points higher at 4.545%, according to Tradeweb.
