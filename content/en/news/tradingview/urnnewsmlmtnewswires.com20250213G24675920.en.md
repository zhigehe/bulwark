BofA Global Research maintained Novo Nordisk (NOVO-B.CO) at buy, with a price target of 1,075 Danish kroner, as it noted the drugmaker's valuation and upcoming oral semaglutide for obesity.

"Our Buy remains based on attractive valuation, with shares close to c10 year low on PE, despite forward growth remaining robust at c12-13% sales CAGR. The key factor for investors is US [total prescriptions] momentum improving to give confidence in sales guide, which has dominated debate post results; we simply believe in Novo's guide as historically having been conservative, with return of EPS momentum possible," researchers wrote Thursday.

The research firm expects the drug's 2026 launch to be an underappreciated opportunity, adding that its clinical profile is compelling. Analysts acknowledged, however, that they understand that investors prefer a "more scaleable oral strategy" as drug supply and food/water admin restrictions provide some debate.
