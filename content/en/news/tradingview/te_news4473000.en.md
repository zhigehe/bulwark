Steel rebar futures hovered below CNY 3,300 per tonne, amid uncertainty over US trade policy as President Donald Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports.

He stated the tariffs would apply to all countries but did not specify when they would take effect, adding to market uncertainty.

The broad measure threatens global trade ties and raises concerns for major exporters like South Korea.

While Trump has previously imposed and later paused tariffs on key partners like Canada and Mexico, the lack of clarity fuels unease.

US steel imports, though a smaller share of consumption, are crucial for industries relying on specialty grades, including aerospace, automotive, and energy.

During Trump’s first term, some oil companies secured exemptions.

South Korea, already diversifying exports since Trump’s initial trade policies, now ships about 70% of its pre-2018 average to the US by volume, though the country remains its top steel customer by value.
