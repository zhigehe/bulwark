British biotechnology company Phytome Life Sciences is looking to set up a headquarters in Saudi Arabia and use it as a hub to fund and manufacture medicines and materials developed by its UK research facilities.

In an interview with Bloomberg News published Monday, Phytome Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Vaughan said the group will initially focus on commercializing inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy and menopausal sleep disorder drugs.

Phytome also plans a venture studio in Riyadh, as well as Saudi-based funding vehicles for investments in plant-based materials, medicines, and food production.
