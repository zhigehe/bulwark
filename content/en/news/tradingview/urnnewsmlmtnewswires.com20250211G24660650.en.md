SGS said Tuesday its profit and sales for full year 2024 increased year over year.

Profit attributable to equity holders for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 581 million francs, compared with 553 million francs earlier. EPS moved to 3.09 francs from 2.99 francs.

The Swiss testing and certification company's sales were 6.79 billion francs, compared with 6.62 billion francs a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 6.81 billion francs in sales, 604.8 million francs in net income, and 3.59 francs in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board intends to propose an unchanged optional scrip dividend of 3.20 francs per share for the period.

Looking ahead, the company expects 5% to 7% organic sales growth in 2025, with the same annual target range set for the period through 2027.
