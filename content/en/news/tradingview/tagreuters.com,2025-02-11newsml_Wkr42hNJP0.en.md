CEO Manuel Stan comments

The Q4 results reflected the ongoing challenges we face in our core markets. For the second consecutive quarter, profitability improved following the measures taken since mid-year to streamline the cost structure. These actions reduced the cost base by 33 percent from Q4 2023, lifting our adjusted EBITDA margin from 5 percent in Q2 to 15 percent in Q4. This represents a significant improvement, but reaching higher profitability will also require a return to top-line growth. In Q4, revenue remained under pressure as measures to focus the group on the new strategic priorities set by management gained traction more slowly than anticipated.

A 6 percent decline in revenue compared to Q3 reflected flat performance in our sports business and the impact of two Google algorithm updates in Q4 that created high volatility levels in our casino-facing organic search operations, with rankings experiencing large day-to-day swings.

It is clear that our initiatives in search engine optimisation (SEO), product development and geographic expansion will take additional time to translate into revenue gains. While this is unsatisfactory in the short term, I believe we now have the right focus areas and organisational structure in place to create a sustainable business with solid long-term growth prospects.

**Addressing our core priorities**

Catena Media has in the past spread its resources too thinly across multiple initiatives, diverting attention from core products. Management seeks to correct this by concentrating efforts on the group’s top-performing sites and products. Further brand optimisation plans are in preparation as we focus hard on how best to serve our customers.

To improve execution and accountability in this leaner approach, we in Q4 introduced objectives and key results metrics (OKRs) across the organisation. Though this may seem a basic step, aligning all personnel around key priorities, tracking performance consistently and ensuring focus on the highest-impact areas is critical to our success.

Work also included a range of granular improvements to support our drive for a revenue rebound in 2025. We improved our primary products’ alignment with Google’s web core vitals and stepped up efforts to enhance our brands’ user experiences so we raise the bar in engagement and retention over time. We also enhanced a new customer relationship management (CRM) system in our key products that will allow us to build longer-term relationships with our users and to extend the consumer lifecycle.

Operationally, we strengthened the organisation with key hires, including directors of SEO, Data and Engineering. We also completed the content streamlining announced in October, reducing the group’s headcount by more than 10 percent to align with our product goals. Additionally, we initiated a three-day-per-week return to work for staff at our Malta office and began establishing a US hub in Miami. These measures will be fully implemented in the second half of 2025.

**New media partnership and AI change**

An exciting development was the signing of an exclusive collaboration with Daily Racing Form (DRF), the premier US source for horse racing insights. In contrast to our previous media partnerships, the relationship with DRF is built on clear mutual value and aligned incentives. The partnership exemplifies the type of strategic relationship we seek – one that drives sustainable profitability for both parties. I look forward to seeing this collaboration reach its full potential.

After careful evaluation, we decided to discontinue our AI-based content generation platform and reached an agreement to acquire 100 percent of the business in January prior to liquidating it. As part of the agreement, we will recoup EUR 0.7m of our original investment. We continue to see AI as an important business enhancer, for example in scaling up content output and quality. However, the new board and management did not deem this venture to be an optimal way to realise the opportunity.

**Continued debt reduction and lower interest costs**

During the quarter, we repaid the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility of EUR 10m. Our remaining debt now comprises the senior unsecured bond due in June 2025, which we are now in a position to repay after receiving the proceeds from the AskGamblers sale. This and other incoming payments mean our overall interest costs in the second half of 2025 will be lower than current levels.

Catena Media enters 2025 as a more focused organisation. While Q4 results continued  to disappoint, we significantly improved our profitability through cost optimisation. Our underlying revenue has stabilised in recent quarters, providing a foundation from which we can build. With a leaner organisation, a stronger balance sheet and a clear strategic roadmap, I remain confident in our future direction. I want to thank our team for their tireless work and all our stakeholders for their continued support.
