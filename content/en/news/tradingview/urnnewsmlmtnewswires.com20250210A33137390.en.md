United States President Donald Trump's threats against the European Union and the pharmaceutical industry as well as the bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. increase the risks of

direct tariffs for Switzerland, said UBS.

However, the trade surplus is balanced by the services deficit and Switzerland having "significant" investments in the U.S. speaks against this, wrote the bank in a note to clients.

Switzerland could be affected by U.S. tariffs through various channels. In the UBS base case, however, the bank expects the Swiss economy to grow "solidly" in 2025 despite selective U.S. tariffs for certain countries and industries.
