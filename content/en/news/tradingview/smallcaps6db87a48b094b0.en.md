MTM Critical Metals believes its breakthrough in successful recovery of gallium and germanium may help unlock a multibillion-dollar market as governments and industries seek sustainable onshore solutions for securing these critical materials. The company’s new testing achieved recovery of approximately 90% gallium and 80% germanium from semiconductor industry waste using its proprietary FJH technology. The fact that only trace amounts of the two critical metals were found in wash solutions confirms the high capture efficiency within the closed system. Critical minerals Gallium and germanium are classified as critical minerals by the US Department of Defense, with no primary domestic production of gallium and more than 50% of US germanium demand met through imports. China’s implementation of export restrictions in 2024 has caused the market for the two to tighten considerably. This has resulted in a surge in investment across North America and Europe in an attempt to pick up the shortfall. High-efficiency recovery Chief executive officer Michael Walshe said the results position MTM as a leader in sustainable, high-efficiency recovery solutions for these ultra-high-value technology metals. “We’re thrilled with FJH technology’s versatility across multiple metals and the latest test results […] couldn’t be timelier given the current geopolitical landscape,” Mr Walshe said. “Gallium and germanium are indispensable to semiconductors and defence applications, yet their supply chains remain highly vulnerable due to overwhelming dependence on imports—particularly from China.” “MTM’s proprietary process offers a commercially viable, environmentally friendly solution to secure domestic supplies of these strategic materials, creating a major economic opportunity for the company.” Indium partnership Mr Walshe said this latest news is backed by the company’s strategic partnership with Indium Corporation, one of the Western world’s largest suppliers of refined specialty technology metals. That collaboration, announced in November 2024, was instrumental in assisting with the sourcing of the high-value feedstock used for the latest FJH testing. Indium’s Metals Manager Markus Roas described the results as a potential “industry game-changer.”
