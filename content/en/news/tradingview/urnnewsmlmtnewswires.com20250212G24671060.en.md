BNK Banking launched a second BNK bank guarantee product on Assuro's digital platform, expanding its collaboration with the financial technology firm, according to a Wednesday Australian bourse filing.

The lender introduced a new high-value guarantee to complement its existing "low-cost" one, offering a variable interest rate on cash security for bank guarantees above AU$50,000 with no ongoing fees, the filing said.
