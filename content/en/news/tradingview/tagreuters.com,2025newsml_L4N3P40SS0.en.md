Key points:

* Ukrainian, Russian assets jump on hopes of peace deal
* Markets brace for Trump's reciprocal tariffs
* Turkish current account deficit widens in December

Most emerging currencies and stocks were higher on Thursday as the dollar retreated, while assets in Russia and Ukraine jumped on the prospects of a ceasefire in their nearly three-year war.

MSCI's index tracking global EM currencies (.MIEM00000CUS) was up 0.1%, and so was the stocks gauge CBOE:EFS, after touching a more than two month high earlier in the session.

Investors were optimistic about emerging Europe, hoping that U.S. President Donald Trump's phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy could end their conflict.

Ukraine's sovereign dollar bonds rallied for a second consecutive day, gaining as much as 2 cents, with the 2035 maturity adding 2 cents to be bid at 60.63 cents on the dollar.

The Russian rouble climbed 3.7% against the dollar, to its highest since September 24, according to over-the-counter market data. Stocks on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX)index surged more than 4%. The euro advanced 0.3% against the dollar.

"Despite the jump in short-dated U.S. rates yesterday, EUR/USD has moved smartly higher on the back of the Trump-Putin story," analysts at ING said.

"Progress on peace in Ukraine could be an important positive for European countries should it deliver lower energy prices and encourage broader investment."

Oil prices fell more than 1%, with investors pricing in a lifting of sanctions on Russia that have disrupted supply flows.

Meanwhile, a report said that China proposed a summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents to help end the conflict.

Elsewhere in Europe, currencies in emerging market economies were little changed against the euro. Stocks in the region rallied, with Poland's main index up 0.7% and Hungary's Budapest stock index up 0.3%.

Israel's shekel was 0.3% higher, while Tel Aviv stocks (.TA125) gained 0.6%.

Turkey's current account deficit narrowed to $9.97 billion in 2024 from nearly $40 billion a year earlier.

South Africa's rand was up 0.2%, while stocks in the resource-heavy country were flat, after hitting a record high level.

Markets also braced for potential reciprocal tariffs from the United States - in line with Trump's vocal threats - on countries that impose duties on U.S. imports.

Elsewhere, the Philippine central bank unexpectedly kept overnight borrowing rate at 5.75% at its latest policy meeting.

Greentown China will buy back $741 million of outstanding bonds and is also planning to issue U.S. dollar-denominated notes as part of a debt refinancing plan.
