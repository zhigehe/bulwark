Four.Meme's decision to burn 100% of TST tokens in the liquidity pool could significantly impact TST's price. Regularly reducing the supply by burning tokens might lead to scarcity, potentially increasing TST's value as demand remains constant or rises. Token holders often view burns positively, as they can indicate a proactive approach to stabilizing or increasing prices. Investors seeking assets with price appreciation potential might be attracted to TST due to this burn strategy. However, for sustained impact, other supportive market conditions need to be present. source
