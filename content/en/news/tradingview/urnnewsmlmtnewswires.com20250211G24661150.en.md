Black Dragon Gold has applied for its Salave gold project in Asturias, northern Spain, to be classified as a strategic investment project under the Principality of Asturias' new Proyectos de Interés Estratégico Regional (PIER) law, designed to fast-track key regional projects, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The project is expected to create hundreds of jobs and meet the law's economic and environmental criteria. A decision on the application is expected by the second quarter, the filing said.

Separately, the company has appealed a rejection by the Tapia de Casariego Town Council of its land rezoning application, filing with the High Court of Justice of Asturias to overturn the decision.

Shares of the company rose 14% at market close.
