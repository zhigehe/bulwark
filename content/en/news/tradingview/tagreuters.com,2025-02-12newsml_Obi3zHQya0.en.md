12 February 2025 - The Board of Directors of Aker Carbon Capture ASA (ACC ASAorthe Company) has determined the way forward for the Company and has todayproposed an extraordinary cash dividend of NOK 5.80 per share, in total NOK3.5billion.

"We propose an extraordinary cash dividend of NOK 3.5 billion to the GeneralAssembly. ACC has been a remarkable success - emerging as a leader in carboncapture technology and delivering significant value to shareholders. From astarting share price of NOK 1.70 to now distributing a dividend of NOK 5.80pershare, this milestone demonstrates the company's strong progress and valuecreation. We are pleased to return substantial cash to shareholders whilemaintaining our commitment to responsible ownership of SLB Capturi," saidKristian Røkke, Chairman of ACC ASA.

In June 2024, ACC ASA and SLB announced the completion of a transactioncombining their carbon capture businesses in a joint venture (JV), sincerenamedSLB Capturi. ACC ASA retains a 20% ownership stake in the JV and SLB holds theremaining 80%. ACC ASA booked a gain on the sale of NOK 4.9 billion in theconsolidated accounts.

Going forward, ACC ASA will, through its ownership in SLB Capturi, continue tosupport the development of the carbon capture business of SLB Capturi. Thecashposition remaining in ACC ASA following the proposed dividend distributionwillenable the Company to retain a sufficiently robust balance sheet to fulfillitsrole and responsibilities as a minority owner of SLB Capturi, and will backACCASA's remaining pro-rata guarantee exposure for projects awarded prior to theformation of the JV. The Company will continuously consider the best wayforwardfor the Company and its shareholders.

Based on an audited interim balance sheet dated 30 December 2024, theCompany'sBoard of Directors has proposed to pay an extraordinary cash dividend of NOK5.80 per share, totaling NOK 3.5 billion. The dividend is subject to approvalbyan extraordinary general meeting in the Company, expected to be held on orabout7 March 2025 (the EGM), including the EGM's approval of the interim balancesheet. The Board of Directors has also proposed, based on the interim balancesheet, to reduce the share capital of the Company by approximately 98%,aligningthe capital with the Company's current operations and also safeguarding thattheproposed dividend is treated as repayment of paid in capital for Norwegian taxpurposes to the largest extent possible. The proposed capital reduction issubject to approval by the EGM, as well as a six weeks' creditor noticeperiod.The Board has on this basis proposed to pay out the dividend in two tranches,asfollows:

· NOK 4.82 per share shall be paid to the Company's shareholders as of 7March2025 (as registered in the VPS as of 11 March 2025), subject to approval bytheEGM, and
