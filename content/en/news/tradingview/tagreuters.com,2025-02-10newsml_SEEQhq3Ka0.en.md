BELGRADE (Serbia), February 10 (SeeNews) - The BELEXsentiment index of the Belgrade Stock Exchange fell to 78.85 points in February - its lowest level since March 2022 - from 113.28 points in January, signalling investor pessimism about future market movements, the bourse said on Monday.

Scores below 100 suggest negative market expectations, while those above 100 signal positive sentiment.

Calculated monthly, the BELEXsentiment combines the weighted input from three voter groups: stock exchange members, portfolio managers of investment and voluntary pension funds, and the general public, represented by users of the bourse's website. The first two groups carry the most significant weight in the index's value.

This is the first time since January 2024 the index scored below 100 points. In February 2024, the index stood at 129.29 points.

In January, the blue-chip BELEX15 index of the Belgrade bourse fell by 1.61% compared to the month before, while the broader BELEXline fell by 0.71%, the bourse said in a statement.

The top three most traded stocks on the Belgrade bourse in January were Aerodrom Nikola Tesla [BEL:AERO], transport firm Jugoprevoz Krusevac [BEL:JGPK], and oil and gas group NIS [BEL:NIIS].

January was marked by the suspension in trading of NIS shares following sanctions against the company imposed by the US Treasury Department, the bourse noted.

Total turnover on the Belgrade bourse amounted to 890 million dinars ($7.85 million/ 7.6 million euro) in January, representing one of the weakest results in the past year, the statement read.

(1 euro = 117.147 dinars)
