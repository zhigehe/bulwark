Consumer stocks were lower late Wednesday afternoon, with the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) easing 0.2% and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) down less than 0.1%.

In sector news, a group of Republican senators on Wednesday proposed a $1,000 tax on new electric vehicle purchases to help pay for road repairs, Reuters reported.

In corporate news, Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting "invidious" forms of diversity, equity and inclusion programs not in compliance with the Federal Communications Commission's regulations, Chairman Brendan Carr said Tuesday in a letter. Comcast shares fell 0.7%.

The Chefs' Warehouse shares jumped over 9% after the company reported fiscal Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.55 per diluted share, up from $0.47 a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $0.51.

Kraft Heinz offered a downbeat full-year earnings outlook on Wednesday as the company's Q4 net sales fell more than expected. Its shares fell 4%.

Restaurant Brands International reported stronger-than-expected Q4 results on Wednesday, driven by comparable sales gains at Tim Hortons and Burger King. Its shares were falling 1.8%.
