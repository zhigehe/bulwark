The Australian dollar remained steady around $0.628 on Thursday, trading sideways for about a week as market caution persisted following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on any country that charges duties on US imports.

This has fueled concerns of an escalating global trade war.

Additionally, hotter-than-expected US consumer inflation data prompted traders to scale back expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Markets are now pricing in just one quarter-point rate cut from the Fed this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating before Congress that the central bank is not in a rush to ease policy.

Domestically, Australian consumer inflation expectations rose to a ten-month high of 4.6% in February, up from 4% in January.

Despite this, markets still anticipate the Reserve Bank of Australia may begin cutting interest rates next week.
