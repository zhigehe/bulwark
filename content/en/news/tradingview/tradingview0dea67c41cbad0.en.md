Adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% to $8.61.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The EFT Processing Segment reported a 12% increase in revenues for the fourth quarter, driven by international travel, growth in merchant acquiring business, and expansion into new markets. The segment also saw a 35% increase in transactions to 3,203 million and a 5% increase in installed ATMs to 55,248.

The epay Segment achieved an 8% increase in revenues for the fourth quarter, with a 31% increase in transactions to 1,185 million. The Money Transfer Segment reported a 9% increase in revenues, with total transactions rising by 11% to 46.9 million.

The company also repurchased $50 million in shares during the quarter. Availability under its revolving credit facility increased to approximately $1,335 million, primarily due to an increase and extension of the credit facility in December 2024 from $1.25 billion to $1.90 billion.

**Management's Perspective**

Michael J. Brown, Euronet's Chairman and CEO, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting the 15% growth in adjusted EPS for the full year. He noted that the strong results were driven by robust performance across all three segments, despite significant increases in interest and tax expenses. Brown emphasized the company's ability to achieve double-digit growth in operating income and adjusted EBITDA.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead, Euronet anticipates its 2025 adjusted EPS to grow between 12% and 16% year-over-year, consistent with its 10 and 20-year compounded annualized growth rates. This outlook does not account for potential changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, or other unforeseen factors.
