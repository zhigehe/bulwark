The break suggests a reversal of the uptrend from $9.47. A retracement analysis on the trend reveals a wide target zone of $9.98-1/2 to $10.29-3/4, formed by the 61.8% and the 38.2% levels.

The contract tried to climb above the trendline on February 10 but failed. A pullback towards the trendline is thus considered complete.

The contract is expected to resume its fall towards $10.31-3/4. A break above $10.50-3/4 could lead to a gain to $10.62-1/2.

On the daily chart, a round top could have been developing around resistance at $10.79-1/4. The bearish divergence on the daily RSI suggests a further drop from the current level.
