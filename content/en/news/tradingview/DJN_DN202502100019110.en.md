CAB Payments will likely make a strategic pivot this year following the departure of senior leadership members, Shore Capital's analyst Vivek Raja says. CFO and executive director Richard Hallett stepped down on Monday, following the departure of other senior management in the past year. Shore Capital maintains its buy recommendation on the stock, expecting the London-listed fintech to return to a meaningful growth trajectory, Raja says. Shares are down 1.3% at 0.62 pounds.
