The total value of Canadian building permits rose 11% month-over-month to $13.1 billion in December, thanks mainly to a 21% jump in the residential sector in Ontario and British Columbia, said the country's statistical agency Tuesday.

On a constant dollar basis (2017=100), the total value of building permits issued in December grew 8.8% from the previous month and was up 31% on a year-over-year basis, noted Statistics Canada in a statement.

The total value of residential permits increased by $1.6 billion to $9.0 billion in December. Multi-unit construction intentions (+$1.5 billion) contributed the most to the gain, posting a 33.3% increase from the previous month, added StatsCan.

Construction intentions for single-family homes were up 1.8% (+$52.1 million) to $2.9 billion in December.

The total value of non-residential permits fell 5.9% month over month, or $262.2 million, to $4.2 billion in December, marking the third monthly decrease in a row. Declines in the commercial ($221.1 million) and institutional ($167.6 million) components more than offset a gain in the industrial component ($126.5 million).

The data refers to the value of permits issued for residential (single-family and multi-family dwellings) and non-residential (industrial, commercial and institutional) construction. It's calculated from a survey of municipalities that issue permits and is seasonally adjusted as the construction industry is sensitive to seasonal changes. It's a leading indicator of Canada's construction industry.
