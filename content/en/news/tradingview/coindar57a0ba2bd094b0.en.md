**MDT Info**

Measurable Data Token (MDT) is a blockchain project designed to provide an efficient, transparent, and secure mechanism for data exchange.

Measurable Data Token (MDT) connects users, data providers, and data buyers and denominates the value of data. It compensates users for sharing anonymous data points while providing data buyers and providers with a more efficient trading model. An important aspect of the MDT ecosystem is that it gives users full control over their data, allowing them to decide what data they want to share and get rewarded for providing it.

MDT's flagship product is the MyMDT app, a mobile application that enables users to accrue MDT tokens by actively participating in data sharing activities.
