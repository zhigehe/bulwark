SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of simple, powerful, secure observability and IT management software, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024. The company reported notable growth in revenue and net income, alongside significant corporate developments.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, SolarWinds reported total revenue of $210.3 million, marking a 6% year-over-year growth. The net income for the quarter was $72.7 million, and the adjusted EBITDA was $104.1 million, representing a margin of 49% of total revenue and a 20% year-over-year growth.

For the full year 2024, the company achieved total revenue of $796.9 million, a 5% increase from the previous year. Net income for the year was $111.9 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $384.7 million, with a margin of 48% of total revenue and a 17% year-over-year growth. Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew by 34% to $311.7 million, while Total ARR increased by 7% to $729.0 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

SolarWinds made significant strides in its business operations, including the launch of new products and services. In October, the company unveiled its SolarWinds Observability SaaS and Self-Hosted offerings, along with a new Universal Database License for its Database Observability products. Additionally, the company released its 2024 State of ITSM Report in November, providing valuable insights into IT service management strategies.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

A major corporate development was announced on February 7, 2025, when SolarWinds entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Turn/River Capital in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, SolarWinds stockholders will receive $18.50 in cash for each share of common stock. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

**Management's Perspective**

Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds President and CEO, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "We ended 2024 on a high note with fourth quarter and full-year total revenue and adjusted EBITDA results that exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges. I’m pleased with the progress of our subscription-first strategy, our strong customer retention, and the continued innovation on the SolarWinds Platform."

Regarding the acquisition by Turn/River Capital, Ramakrishna added, "We are pleased to reach this significant milestone in the SolarWinds journey. Partnering with Turn/River Capital, we believe we can invest to fast-track a broader set of SolarWinds Platform innovations and an even greater focus on customer success to help navigate the complexities of today's hybrid and multi-cloud environments."

**Future Outlook**

Due to the pending acquisition by Turn/River Capital, SolarWinds will not be holding an earnings conference call to discuss its financial results and will not be providing financial outlook for 2025.
