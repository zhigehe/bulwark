Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica reported an increase in revenue for the fourth quarter that was in line with market expectations amid a push to smart glasses.

The Franco-Italian eyewear group said Wednesday that it booked quarterly revenue of 6.78 billion euros ($6.92 billion), up 9.2% at constant currency compared with the prior-year period. The result was slightly above analysts' forecasts of 6.68 billion euros, according to a Visible Alpha consensus.

For 2024, EssilorLuxottica's net profit jumped to 2.36 billion euros from 2.29 billion euros in 2023, below analysts' expectations of 2.50 billion euros.
