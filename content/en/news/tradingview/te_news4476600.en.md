Rice futures traded around $14 per hundredweight, their highest since late January, as traders weighed the prospect of reduced supply and demand.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's February WASDE report projected a tighter global outlook for 2024/25 compared to the previous month, with reductions in supply, consumption, trade, and ending stocks.

Global supplies were lowered by 0.4 million tons to 712.4 million, primarily due to a lower production estimate for China, while world consumption was reduced by 0.1 million tons to 530.2 million, mainly reflecting weaker forecasts for Bangladesh and China.
