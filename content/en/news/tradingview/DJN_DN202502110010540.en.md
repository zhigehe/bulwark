SGS's 2024 results show the company's strong execution toward its 2027 plan, but its outlook for the year ahead seems conservative, Bernstein's Will Kirkness and Filippo Giardini say in a research note. The Swiss testing, inspection and certification company expects organic sales growth of 5% to 7%, against Bernstein's forecast of 6.7% and consensus estimates of 5.9%, the analysts say. It expects an improvement of at least 30 basis points in its adjusted operating profit margin relative to the 15.3% margin it reported for 2024. This compares with Bernstein's estimate of 16% and the consensus of 15.7%, the analysts say. "We view the outlook as conservative and contingent on further [foreign-exchange] developments," they add.
