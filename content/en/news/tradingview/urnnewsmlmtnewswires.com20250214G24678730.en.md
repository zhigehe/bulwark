Xinxiang Tianli Energy said one of its shareholders, Henan Fude Gaoke New Materials Venture Fund, plans to sell 5.4 million shares, equivalent to 4.55% of total equity, through block trades between Mar. 6 and Jun. 5, according to a Wednesday filing with the Shenzhen Bourse.

The sale is due to the fund's impending expiration. The final price and quantity may be adjusted based on market conditions and corporate actions. The reduction will not affect company control.
