European equity markets were set to open lower on Friday, taking a breather after surging to record highs in the previous session.

Traders also continue to assess the impact of US tariffs on European growth after President Donald Trump signed an executive order for reciprocal tariffs but delayed imposing levies, stating they would take effect only after the White House reviews appropriate tariff levels.

In economic news, Germany’s wholesale prices rose at its fastest pace in over 18 months.

On the corporate front, earnings reports are expected from major firms, including Hermès International, Safran, NatWest, and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.

In premarket trading, Euro Stoxx 50 and Stoxx 600 futures fell 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
