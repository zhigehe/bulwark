(Updates with Axsome stock's recent movement in the headline and first paragraph.)

Axsome Therapeutics shares were up more than 24% in recent Monday trading after the company said it has agreed to a settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals to resolve patent litigation over Auvelity, or dextromethorphan HBr - bupropion HCl.

Under the settlement agreement, Axsome said it will grant Teva a license to sell a generic version of Auvelity no earlier than March 31, 2039, if pediatric exclusivity is granted, or Sept. 30, 2038, if not. The parties also agreed to dismiss all ongoing litigation between them over Auvelity patents in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.

The settlement will be submitted to the US Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice for review.
