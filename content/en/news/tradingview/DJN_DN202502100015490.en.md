The FTSE 100 is expected to open seven points higher, or 0.1%, according to IG. The index closed 26 points lower, or 0.3%, to 8700 points Friday. President Trump on Sunday said he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports from Monday. Risky assets are becoming desensitized to Trump's tariff announcements, Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar says in a note. "Our view in tariffs remain that they will cause volatility, are a negotiating tool and will eventually be not as bad as feared." Elsewhere, this week's focus is on U.S. inflation data Wednesday, a testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Wednesday and U.K. economic growth data on Thursday.
