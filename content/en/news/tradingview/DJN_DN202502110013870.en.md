BYD's new driving-assistance system is notable as it brings advanced autonomous-driving technology to the masses with a price tag of under 100,000 yuan, Bernstein analysts write in a note. One key challenge that had weighed on BYD's stock previously was its laggard status in driving-assistance tech, they note. BYD's launch demonstrates the company's ability to catch up with competitors, they say. BYD has outpaced rivals in investing in R&D, and boasts a considerably bigger research team of more than 110,000 engineers, including more than 5,000 dedicated to its advanced driver-assistance system, Bernstein says. The asset management firm maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price of HK$350.00. Shares are last at HK$328.80. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
