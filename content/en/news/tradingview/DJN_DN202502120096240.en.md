Super Micro Computer's plan to have several regulatory filings finalized and released prior to the February 25 deadline, should reduce uncertainty for investors, Wedbush analysts Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault say in a research note. JPMorgan analysts raise their price targets on the company to $35 from $23, "largely on the back of the increased conviction from the management team to meet regulatory deadlines," they say in a research note. For that same reason, the JPMorgan analysts are ascribing a higher earnings multiple to the stock. That said, the delayed filings marked Super Micro's second flirtation with questionable financials and may continue to weigh on its perceived risk profile, the Wedbush analysts say in their note. Super Micro Computer climbs 1.5% and is up 29% year-to-date. (dean.seal@wsj.com)
