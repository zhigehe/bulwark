Australia’s 10-year government bond yields fell to around 4.48%, mirroring declines in global yields as markets continued to monitor trade tensions.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order for reciprocal tariffs but delayed imposing levies, stating they would take effect only after the White House reviews appropriate tariff levels.

Meanwhile, stronger-than-expected US PPI inflation in January prompted markets to push back Fed rate cut expectations to September from June.

Domestically, investors await the Reserve Bank of Australia’s first policy meeting of the year next week, with markets pricing a 95% chance of a cut to 4.10%, as data suggests underlying inflation is cooling faster than expected alongside signs of slowing economic growth.
