Singapore economy is expected to stay resilient this year, as strong local wage and employment growth should help cushion the impact of growing trade protectionism, says RHB Bank's Barnabas Gan. The city-state's negative output gap closed in 4Q 2024, coinciding with stronger-than-expected growth, Gan writes in a note. The shift toward a positive output gap is likely to continue into 1H, he says. Fiscal policy measures are likely to focus on stimulating domestic economic activity, he adds. RHB maintains Singapore's 2025 GDP growth forecast at 3.0%, which is at the top end of the official 1.0%-3.0% range. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
