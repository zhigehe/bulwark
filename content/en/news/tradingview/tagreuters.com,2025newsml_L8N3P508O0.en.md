Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro missed fourth quarter profit expectations on Friday, as higher costs and weak downstream demand were only partly offset by strong alumina and aluminium prices and positive currency exchange effects.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation grew to 7.70 billion Norwegian crowns ($690.5 million) in the October-December period, up from 3.74 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 8.28 billion crowns on average.

U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium are inflating U.S. prices and exposing the gap in domestic production, creating a potential cost surge for aluminium producers like Hydro who rely on imports to meet U.S. demand.

"As the U.S. is a major aluminium importer, tariffs will likely raise premiums and costs, with Midwest premiums already surging to the highest levels since April 2023," Hydro said in the statement.

($1 = 11.1511 Norwegian crowns)
