The US Treasury plans to sanction entities and countries facilitating the shipment of Iranian crude oil to China, according to the Treasury's press release on Feb. 6.

China, along with India, the UAE, and several vessels, is among the targets of the sanctions.

The sanctions aim to curb the funding of terrorist groups, as Iran generates billions from oil sales to finance organizations such as Hamas, the Houthis, and Hizballah, the Treasury said.

The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and the country's sanctioned company, Sepehr Energy.

The statement came after President Donald Trump said he will drive Iran's oil exports to zero to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon, according to a same-dated Reuters report.
