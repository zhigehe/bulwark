By Hannah Erin Lang

Shares of Charles Schwab slipped Monday after Toronto-Dominion Bank announced it plans to sell its 10.1% stake in the brokerage.

TD Bank said it would sell approximately 185 million shares of Schwab as the Canadian bank looks to shore up its business. The move-though hardly unexpected-weighed on Schwab shares, which were down about 2.5% in afternoon trading.

Schwab agreed to buy back about $1.5 billion worth of stock from TD Bank. On a January earnings call, Schwab CFO Mike Verdeschi said the company plans to keep buying back stock over the course of 2025.

Upon completion of the sale, two TD Bank-appointed directors-including former CEO Bharat Masrani-will resign from Schwab's board, according to a regulatory filing.
