Euronext reported higher than expected fourth quarter revenue on Thursday, supported by a contribution from non-volume related activities and the expansion of its clearing business.

The pan-European stock exchange operator recorded revenue of 415.8 million euros ($431.68 million) in the last three months of 2024, while analysts had expected 408.8 million euros in a consensus compiled by Euronext.

Fixed income trading revenue notably grew by 23.7% to 37.8 million euros in the same period.

Non-volume related revenue, which refers to income generated from trading activities not directly tied to the volume of trades, made up 59% of the group's revenue in the quarter.

Euronext has been implementing a change in its business mix, shifting away from trading of cash and derivatives towards higher valued custody & settlement and fixed income trading.

It also exceeded annual growth targets for both revenue and core earnings.

"In 2024, Euronext achieved several key milestones that allowed us to expand our presence across the entire capital markets value chain, as we have finalised the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group," CEO St√©phane Boujnah in a press release.

Euronext acquired the Italian stock exchange in 2021, enabling it to create a major bond trading platform and set up an internal clearing system.

The Borsa Italiana acquisition gave it greater heft in pan-European share trading and listings, while turning it into a major clearer and settler of securities in-house.

Euronext said it would propose a dividend payout of 292.8 million euros at its next shareholders' meeting, in line with the returns policy confirmed last November.

German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse on Tuesday also posted fourth quarter results ahead of market expectations, with a 25% rise in net profit, but warned of headwinds in 2025 due to lower interest rates.
