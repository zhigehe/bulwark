Carrier Global logged higher profit and revenue in the fourth quarter, though the top line missed analyst forecasts.

The air-conditioning and building-automation company posted net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.55 billion, or $2.82 a share, compared to $420 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were 54 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting 50 cents a share.

Sales jumped to $5.15 billion from $4.32 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $5.32 billion.

Chief Executive David Gitlin said the company was positioned to deliver strong results in 2025, reinforced in part by its growing commercial HVAC backlog, supported by the acceleration in data centers.

Carrier raised full-year adjusted earnings guidance to between $2.95 a share and $3.05 a share from a previous estimate of $2.50 share in adjusted earnings.
