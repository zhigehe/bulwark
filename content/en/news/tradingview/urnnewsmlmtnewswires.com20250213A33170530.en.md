Shares of US Foods fell intraday Thursday after the foodservice distributor reported in-line sales that partly reflected headwinds from hurricanes that weighed on restaurant foot traffic, particularly in the Southeast.

Sales rose to $9.49 billion for the three months ended Dec. 28 from $8.94 billion and met analysts expectations in a FactSet poll. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $0.84 from $0.64 year over year and topped the $0.80 consensus.

Shares of US Foods were down 2.7% in Thursday trade.

"The fourth quarter was noisy due to the impact of the devastating hurricanes that hit near the end of the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, affecting industry volumes, specifically in the Southeast, where we have a larger portion of our independent business," Chief Executive Dave Flitman told analysts on a conference call, according to a FactSet transcript. "The election and holiday calendar shift also impacted restaurant foot traffic."

Case volume increased 3.5% amid gains in the independent restaurant category, healthcare and hospitality. Storms, weather and the calendar shift translated into an estimated 150-basis-point to 200-basis-point headwind to independent and hospitality case growth, Flitman told analysts.

For 2025, the company is guiding for sales growth of 4% to 6% over 2024's sales of $37.88 billion, which was up 6.4% year to year. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to climb 17% to 23% from 2024's $3.15, which marked an improvement of 20% from the year prior.

The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $39.92 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.82 for the ongoing year.

Through 2027, US Foods is on track to achieve a 5% compound annual growth rate for sales and a 20% CAGR for adjusted EPS, Flitman said in a statement.

"I am highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry volume growth over the long-term and expand margins through our extensive portfolio of self-help initiatives," he said on the call.
