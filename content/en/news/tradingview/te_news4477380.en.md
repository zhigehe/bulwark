Industrial production in the UK rose by 0.5% month-on-month in December 2024, rebounding from an upwardly revised 0.5% fall in the previous month and beating market estimates of 0.2% gain.

At the same time, production declined at a softer pace for electricity, gas, steam and air-conditioning supply (-0.6% vs -2%).

Meanwhile, activity tumbled for water supply, sewerage and waste management (-0.4% vs 1.4%).

On a yearly basis, industrial output dropped by 1.9% in December, slightly cooling from an upwardly revised 2% decrease in November and below market expectations of a 2.1% loss.
