Shifts in consumer demand and food regulation are posing risks for many big food makers, but Hain Celestial says it sees developments as a tailwind. The organic food maker says its products use no artificial colors, including Red 3, which the FDA recently banned in food. Hain also says it has been working with experts to understand the nutritional needs of weight-loss drug users, and that it plans to begin marketing some of its goods to those consumers in the near future. "Our positioning and free-from-artificials portfolio is a true differentiator, particularly in the US," says Hain CEO Wendy Davidson, noting that Hain only uses colors from natural sources like fruits and vegetables.(jesse.newman@wsj.com)
