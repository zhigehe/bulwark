The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority cleared BlackRock's $3.2 billion acquisition of U.K. data provider Preqin after launching an investigation into the deal on competition concerns.

The regulator said Wednesday that based on the information currently available, it won't refer the merger for a further in-depth investigation.

The CMA said on Dec. 13 that it was formally opening an investigation into the deal, having previously said that it wanted to assess whether the acquisition might stifle competition in the U.K.

BlackRock agreed to buy Preqin at the end of June last year, saying the deal would add a highly complementary data business to its investment technology as the asset manager seeks to expand into the private-markets data business.
