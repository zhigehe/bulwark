While GrainCorp's initial guidance for FY 2025 earnings disappoints RBC Capital Markets, it could just be acting conservatively. GrainCorp has pointed to FY 2025 Ebitda of A$270 million-A$320 million, missing consensus expectations by some 10%. Still, analyst Owen Birrell says there is a higher degree of market uncertainty than in previous years. Specifically, GrainCorp called out "recent uncertainty in global trade policies" among issues that could influence annual earnings. GrainCorp's shares fall 8.7% in early trade, with a new A$50 million share buyback program offering only limited support.(david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
