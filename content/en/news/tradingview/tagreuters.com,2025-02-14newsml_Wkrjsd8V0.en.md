Investment AB Latour

Investment AB Latour has, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Swegon Group AB acquired American Geothermal, an American manufacturer of heating and cooling systems for the concrete industry as well as heat pumps and chiller products for healthcare, commercial, industrial, government and institutional buildings. Through the acquisition, Swegon strengthens its presence in the North American market.

American Geothermal has a strong position and legacy in manufacturing batchwater heating and cooling equipment for the concrete industry. This expertise has paved the way for the development of heat pumps and chillers tailored for the commercial and HVAC sectors, which are sold under the ChillMaster name. Founded in 1981, American Geothermal has 40 employees with headquarters in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Sales amounted to 14 MUSD in 2024.

“As green environmental initiatives and regulations continue to evolve, we see great potential to grow our heat pump and chillers business in North America and complete our BlueBox offering. This acquisition marks a milestone in our strategy to increase our presence in North America. In addition, we are excited to add a US manufacturing site with great people and extensive experience and knowledge to our team”, says Andreas Örje Wellstam, CEO Swegon Group.

“There is a strong urgency to decarbonise HVAC systems in both new and existing buildings, and American Geothermal offers all electric solutions that use advanced technology to both heat and cool water. We are happy to become part of the Swegon North America family and look forward to continue expanding both our American Geothermal and ChillMaster businesses. Together with Swegon’s well-established sales network across the US and Canada we especially look forward to create new opportunities to expand ChillMaster’s product reach”, says Tom Anderson, CEO American Geothermal.

As an effect of the acquisition, the net debt (excl. IFRS 16) of the Latour Group increases to approximately SEK 12.7 billion compared to the net debt level at the end of December 2024, all else equal.
