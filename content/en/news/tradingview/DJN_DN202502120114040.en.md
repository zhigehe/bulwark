By Tarini Parti

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump's "whole of government economic approach" would bring down inflation even with lower interest rates.

"The president had record low interest rates and inflation rates in his first term. He believes that the economy can handle it and withstand it," she said.

Leavitt also blamed the Biden administration for the uptick in inflation.

"The Biden administration indeed left us with a mess to deal with. It's far worse than I think anybody anticipated, because, unfortunately, the previous administration was not transparent about where the economy truly was," she said.
