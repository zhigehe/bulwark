\*\* Shares in Kemira fall about 8% after the Finnish chemical solutions maker missed Q4 profit forecasts due to weaker margins and higher-than-expected one-off costs

\*\* Kemira reports Q4 operative EBITDA of 135 million euros ($139.16 million), below LSEG IBES estimate of 142.3 million euros

\*\* Inderes says Kemira's profitability fell short of expectations, with its two main segments underperforming and operational EBITDA dropping y/y

\*\* "Kemira recorded significantly higher one-off costs than anticipated for Q4," Inderes says, adding that "combined with operational developments, this pushed earnings per share down to EUR 0.31, below expectations"

\*\* Kemira shares, heading for a biggest single-day drop in about 7 months if losses persist, are at the bottom of pan-European STOXX 600 index
