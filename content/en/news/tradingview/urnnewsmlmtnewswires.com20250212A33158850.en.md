Consumer stocks were mixed late Wednesday afternoon with the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) easing 0.2% and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) rising 0.3%.

In corporate news, Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting "invidious" forms of diversity, equity and inclusion programs not in compliance with the Federal Communications Commission's regulations, Chairman Brendan Carr said Tuesday in a letter. Comcast shares fell 0.5%.
