The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.566 on Wednesday, amid a steady U.S. dollar as traders await key inflation data due later in the day.

On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates, citing a strong economy and persistent inflationary pressures.

Investors are also monitoring developments related to U.S. trade policies, as any indications of escalating trade tensions could weigh on the Kiwi dollar.

Domestically, the currency remains under pressure as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely expected to cut its current cash rate of 4.25% by 50bps next week, amid a weakening economy.
