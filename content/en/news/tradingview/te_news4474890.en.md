The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 0.5% to below the 25,540 mark on Tuesday, weighed down by declines in major mining, financial, and tech stocks, although gains in the energy sector helped limit the downturn.

Agnico Eagle, Barrick Gold, and Wheaton Precious each dropped over 1% as gold prices retreated from record highs, while key financial institutions such as Brookfield and Manulife declined around 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively.

Additionally, e-commerce mega-cap Shopify lost nearly 4% despite beating Q4 estimates, as disappointing first-quarter 2025 guidance spooked investors.

In contrast, energy producers including Suncor, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus rallied between 1.7% and 2% on the back of rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, investor caution prevailed after U.S. President Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a flat 25% without exceptions, a measure intended to support domestic industries but one that risks sparking trade conflicts.
