The European Central Bank should ease policy only gradually and not target a difficult-to-define "neutral" level for interest rates, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said on Wednesday.

The ECB has cut interest rates five times since last June and hinted at even more easing in the coming months as the economy ails, fuelling speculation about how far it might cut its 2.75% deposit rate.

Economists see the neutral rate, which neither stimulates nor slows growth, as a possible destination and their views were given a boost when the ECB published a paper showing this level could be around 1.75% to 2.25%.

But Nagel, like many of his colleagues, played down neutral, also called "r-star" in central bank-speak, arguing that it was a good theoretical concept that was not very useful for policymaking, given the uncertainty over its exact level.

"The closer we get to the neutral rate, the more appropriate it becomes to take a gradual approach," Nagel said in a speech in London. "The limits of the concept are also clear: it would be risky to base decisions mainly on r-star estimates."

Nagel added that the Bundesbank's own estimate for the neutral rate was between 1.8% and 2.5%, a band so wide that the next cut could already take the ECB to neutral or it could still be several steps away.

Instead, the ECB should remain data driven and gradualist, especially in the current, highly uncertain environment, he argued.

The ECB next meets on March 6 and a rate cut to 2.5% is fully priced in.
