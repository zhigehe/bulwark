*No serious side effects or discomfort observed* 

Final safety and absorption data expected in March *2025*

SARASOTA, FL, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Silo Pharma, Inc. (“Silo” or the “Company”), a developmental stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel therapeutics and drug delivery systems, today announced a positive update from an ongoing study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of its novel SP-26 ketamine extended-release rods when implanted subcutaneously. The SP-26 implant is a novel self-administered, non-opioid therapeutic intended for the treatment of chronic pain and fibromyalgia.

The launch of our non-GLP study in December 2024 marked the first small animal testing of SP-26, a key preclinical milestone. Implantation (dosing) was completed in the first week of January 2025 and no animals experienced serious side effects or discomfort. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) testing is nearing completion and final safety, and pharmacokinetic reports are expected in March 2025.

“We are encouraged by the early initial data from the SP-26 animal study, with no abnormal clinical observations reported so far,” said Eric Weisblum, CEO of Silo. “We believe that a successful final outcome would provide clear, actionable data for validating the advancing of SP-26 as a potential treatment for chronic pain.”

**About SP-26**

SP-26 is a ketamine-based injectable dissolvable polymer implant for the treatment of chronic pain and fibromyalgia. The subcutaneous implant is being designed to safely regulate dosage and time release of the pain-relieving treatment. If clinically successful, SP-26 could qualify for the FDA’s streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for drug approval.
