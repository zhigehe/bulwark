Health and Happiness (H&H) International has fully redeemed $24.7 million of senior bonds ahead of their maturity on Thursday, a same-day filing with the Hong Kong Bourse stated.

The redemption price for the 13.5% bonds falling due in 2026 was 109.54% of the redemption principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

Following redemption, the bonds have been cancelled and the infant formula manufacturer has applied to the Hong Kong bourse for withdrawal of the listing of the bonds. The withdrawal is expected to become effective Feb. 21.
