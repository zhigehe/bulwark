A winding-up petition against Strong Petrochemical Holdings was dismissed by the Hong Kong High Court at the Feb. 10 hearing following the recent Speed Success case decision by a Cayman Island's Court, according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong bourse.

Previously, the Cayman Island Court declared the matter a dispute solely between Yao Guoliang and Speed Success. It added that while Strong Petrochemical is the subject of the proceedings for discovery purposes, it will not actively participate unless directed by the court.
