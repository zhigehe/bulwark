1) Criminal Court Milan

On 11 October 2024, EAM submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of Cassationasking it to once again set aside the judgement from the appeal court receivedon 4 July 2024. The grounds for this appeal can be read in previous stockexchange notices.

EAM has been informed that the Supreme Court of Cassation has now fixed thehearing date for 18 March 2025. It is expected, but not guaranteed, that thecourt will deliver its judgement on the same day.

2) UBI Banca Case in BresciaIn the Stock Exchange Notice dated 8 January 2025, EAM informed of thenegativedecision in the court proceedings against UBI Banca, now a part of IntesaSanPaolo. The company informed that it would appeal the judgement within 30days. This was based on the expectation that UBI would serve the judgement onEAM, triggering a 30-day timeline for appeal.

As of today, UBI has not enforced the judgement. This is likely because theparties have begun preliminary talks about finding an alternative solution tothe dispute. EAM cannot comment any further on this process at this time.

In any event, the absolute deadline for an appeal is 6 months from the date ofthe judgement. In this matter, such deadline would be 4 July 2025.
