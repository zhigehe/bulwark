Industry sources and experts indicate Apple (AAPL, Financials) is investigating the robotics business as a possible future focus point.

The tech giant is looking at both humanoid and non-humanoid robotic prototypes even if research is still in its early years. According to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's main priorities are user interactions with robots rather than their outward look.

It is said that the company favors anthropomorphic design elementsthat is, aspects akin to human-like characteristicsinstead of building only entirely humanoid robots.

Apple's research and development programs draw attention to improved sensor hardware and software, suggesting a focus on artificial intelligence-driven interaction over just mechanical robots. The goal appears to be creating robots competent of basic customer contact, thus enhancing Apple's present range of smart devices.

Kuo argues that because the robotics industry typically follows long development cycles necessitating major testing and modification, an Apple-branded robot is unlikely to reach consumers until 2028 or later. Comparisons to Apple's prior ground-breaking ideas in wearables, telephones, and personal computers have been made about its potential debut into the market.
