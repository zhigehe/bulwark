Grace Therapeutics, Inc., a late-stage biopharma company, has released its financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2025, ending December 31, 2024. The company, which is advancing GTx-104, a novel injectable formulation of nimodipine for IV infusion, has reported significant progress in both clinical and corporate goals.

**Financial Highlights**

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, Grace Therapeutics reported a net loss of $4.2 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.21 per share, for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $1.3 million difference in the change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities, an increase in research and development expenses of $0.8 million, and a decrease in interest income of $0.2 million, offset in part by a $0.4 million increase in income tax benefit.

Total research and development expenses for the quarter were $2.2 million, up from $1.4 million in the same period last year, mainly due to increased research activities for the GTx-104 pivotal Phase 3 safety clinical trial. General and administrative expenses slightly decreased to $1.5 million from $1.6 million, primarily due to lower professional fees and stock-based compensation, offset by higher salaries and benefits.

As of December 31, 2024, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $11.1 million, a decrease from $23.0 million as of March 31, 2024.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

* Announced that the Phase 3 STRIVE-ON safety trial met its primary endpoint.
* Anticipates submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA in the first half of 2025.
* Secured private placement financing of up to $30 million, with an initial upfront funding of $15 million and the potential for an additional $15 million upon warrant exercise.
* Hosted a virtual key opinion leader (KOL) event discussing the high unmet medical need and current treatment landscape for aSAH patients.
* Received FDA guidance on the design of a pivotal efficacy and safety trial for GTx-102, which could support an NDA with appropriate confirmatory evidence.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Grace Therapeutics secured up to $30 million in private placement financing led by Nantahala Capital and ADAR1 Partners, along with other healthcare-focused investors. This investment will support pre-commercial planning, commercial team build-out, and product launch if GTx-104 is approved. The company is focused on finalizing the NDA submission for GTx-104 by the end of June 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Prashant Kohli, CEO of Grace Therapeutics, highlighted the significant progress made in both clinical and corporate goals. He emphasized the positive topline data from the Phase 3 STRIVE-ON trial, which demonstrated improved clinical outcomes for patients treated with GTx-104 compared to orally administered nimodipine. Kohli also noted the potential medical and pharmacoeconomic benefits of GTx-104 in aSAH patients, which could drive adoption by neurocritical care physicians and hospital pharmacies.

**Future Outlook**

The company anticipates submitting an NDA for GTx-104 in the first half of 2025. The standard of care for aSAH has not seen meaningful innovation in nearly 40 years, and the STRIVE-ON trial results suggest a promising role for GTx-104 as a potential breakthrough for aSAH patient care, pending FDA approval.
