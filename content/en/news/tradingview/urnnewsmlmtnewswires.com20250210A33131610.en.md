Kosmos Energy said Monday that it achieved first liquified natural gas production at the bp-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project, offshore Mauritania and Senegal.

As part of the commissioning process, gas from the first phase of the project started to flow from wells to the floating production storage and offloading vessel and has now been delivered to the floating LNG vessel where liquefaction has started.

Moreover, bp has given notice to the offtaker for an LNG carrier to arrive later this quarter to export the first LNG cargo, the company said.
