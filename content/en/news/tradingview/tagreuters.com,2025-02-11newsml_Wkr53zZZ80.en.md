NCC has signed an agreement with Tyresö Municipality outside Stockholm to build a new school with associated sports hall. The project is a turnkey contract in partnering form with an order value of approximately SEK 600 million.

In addition to dismantling the existing school, NCC’s assignment includes the construction of a new school covering just over 10,000 square meters, three floors and a basement with a civil defense shelter, as well as a sports hall covering approximately 3,000 square meters on two levels.

The new Njupkärr School will have 550 places for students from preschool to Year 6.

“With the new Njupkärr school, we will have a sustainable school for the future and creative learning environments for our youngest Tyresö residents. The school and sports hall will create a vibrant meeting place in the area, with school and sports environments that will be welcoming and safe even outside of school hours. We are also proud that we, with this project, can contribute new knowledge and new methods for recycling in the construction sector,” says Louise Bergman, Head of Strategy and Projects at Tyresö Municipality.

NCC and Tyresö Municipality have worked closely together with a strong focus on climate measures. In autumn 2024, dismantlement of the existing school commenced with the intention to re-use large parts of the building, such as the glulam beams and bricks. Windows and glass sections will primarily be recycled into new window glass, but also glass wool.

“The planning process together with Tyresö Municipality has been successful. Our focus has been reduced climate footprint and cost efficiency. NCC possesses a great deal of expertise about both school buildings and the specific impact areas of this project. When we, like this, can collaborate with our customers from an early stage, we can optimally leverage this expertise,” says Niklas Sparw, Head of NCC Building Sweden.

The school and sports hall are scheduled for completion by the autumn term of 2027. The order value is approximately SEK 600 million and will be registered in the NCC Building Sweden business area in the first quarter of 2025.
