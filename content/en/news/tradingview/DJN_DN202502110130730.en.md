Ley Choon Group Holdings' share price may extend its uptrend, according to a technical chart, Phillip Securities Research's Zane Aw says. The share price is consolidating within a "bullish flag" formation between S$0.055 and $0.059, which gives a bullish signal that it could sustain its uptrend, the analyst says. Also, momentum of the moving average convergence divergence indicator has been increasing, which supports the bullish view, the analyst says. Should shares rise above S$0.059 resistance level of the "bullish flag," they could extend gains to S$0.063, the analyst adds. Shares last quoted at S$0.055. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
