China's consumer price index rose 0.5% year over year in January, the fastest in five months, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released Sunday.

The figure is higher than the 0.4% estimate by economists polled by Reuters.

Urban inflation grew 0.6% while rural inflation increased 0.3%, the NBS said.

Food prices inched up 0.4% while non-food prices rose 0.5%.

On a month-on-month basis, the CPI grew 0.7%, below the forecast 0.8% expansion, but better than the flat reading between November and December 2024.
