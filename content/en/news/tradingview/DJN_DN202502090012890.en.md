By Megan Graham

Jeep's two-minute Super Bowl commercial hit patriotic notes as actor Harrison Ford argued that freedom was "the roar of one man's engine, and the silence of another's," showing gas, hybrid and electric models.

"We won't always agree on which way to go, but our differences can be our strength," Ford said later in the ad.

Many Super Bowl advertisers these days try to maximize the return on their multimillion-dollar investment by releasing their commercials online ahead of the game, but the Stellantis auto brand kept its ad under wraps until it aired.

The ad is meant to be memorable for viewers, even if they aren't immediately in the market for a new car, said Olivier Francois, global chief marketing officer at Stellantis, in a video released by the company.

"Not everyone is going to purchase a Jeep the Monday after the Super Bowl, but they will all have a lasting impression of what we did," he said.

Jeep previously tried to bridge consumers' political divide in a 2021 Super Bowl ad that starred Bruce Springsteen narrating a somber plea to come together.
