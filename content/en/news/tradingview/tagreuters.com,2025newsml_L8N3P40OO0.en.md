\*\* Shares in Metso rise 5.7% after the Finnish mining equipment maker reported a better than expected order intake and improved cash flow in Q4

\*\* "The Group's orders received grew by 13 percent, thanks especially to the strong order intake for the Minerals equipment business," CEO Sami Takaluoma said in the statement

\*\* Q4 orders of EUR 1.39 billion ($1.45 billion) were higher than the EUR 1.32 billion expected by analysts on average

\*\* Q4 sales of EUR 1.27 billion also slightly beat estimates

\*\* "Cash flow, which has been a key focus for investors, did improve, aided by a working capital release of €43m, marking a step up from the €4m achieved in 3Q24," J.P.Morgan says

\*\* The shares are on the track for their best day in a year if the gains hold

($1 = 0.9601 euros)
