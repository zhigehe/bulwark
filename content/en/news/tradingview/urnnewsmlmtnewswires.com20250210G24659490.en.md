Ordell Minerals acquired and consolidated tenements adjacent to its Goodia gold-lithium project in Western Australia, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

The firm will issue shares worth AU$40,000 to Greatland Gold at a deemed issue price of AU$0.32 per share for the acquisition of a tenement, which includes the provision of all exploration data as well as the assignment of a heritage agreement.

The new tenements cover around 16 strike kilometers, with the firm holding over 30 strike kilometers combined with the project tenements.

The company will evaluate previous gold, lithium, and nickel exploration work undertaken at the site, and conduct reconnaissance air core drilling to test geochemical anomalies generated from soil sampling.

Ordell Minerals' shares rose above 4% in recent trading on Tuesday.
