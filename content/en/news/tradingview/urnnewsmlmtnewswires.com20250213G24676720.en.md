Japan Tobacco's profit attributable to owners of the parent slipped 4% to 463.4 billion yen in the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, from 482.3 billion yen a year ago as higher operating profit was more than offset by increased financing costs.

The tobacco company's earnings per share declined to 260.94 yen from 271.63 yen a year ago, according to a filing.

Revenue grew 10.9% to about 3.150 trillion yen from 2.841 trillion yen a year earlier.

Japan Tobacco forecasted attributable profit to decline 2.9% to 450.0 billion yen, or 253.44 yen per share, and revenue to rise 3.9% to 3.273 trillion yen for the year ending Dec. 31.

It declared a year-end dividend of 97 yen per share, payable March 27, 2025.

The company expects to pay interim and year-end dividends of 97 yen per share, maintaining the total annual dividend at 194 yen per share for the current fiscal year.

Shares of the company declined nearly 3% in morning trade Friday.
