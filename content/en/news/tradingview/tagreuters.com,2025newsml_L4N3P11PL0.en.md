Australia's CSL Ltd reported a 5% rise in its first-half profit on Tuesday, boosted by growth in its core immunoglobulin business across geographies.

Strong underlying demand for CSL's immunoglobulin products for the treatment of patients with chronic immune system disorders drove up sales.

Total revenue from the company's largest division, Behring, for the six months ended December 31 rose 10% to $5.74 billion.

Meanwhile, revenue for CSL Seqirus, the company's influenza-related products division, fell 9%.

"CSL Seqirus was negatively impacted by significantly low influenza immunisation rates, particularly in the United States," CEO Paul McKenzie said.

The biotech giant said that its underlying net profit after tax attributable for the half year was $2.11 billion, on a constant currency basis, compared with $2.06 billion reported a year ago.

On a reported currency basis, its profit was $2.07 billion, missing a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of $2.16 billion.

It declared an interim dividend of $1.30 per share, higher than $1.19 per share declared a year ago.
