LONGVIEW, Texas, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Friedman Industries, Incorporated (NYSE American: FRD) announced today its results of operations for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024.

**December 31, 2024 Quarter Highlights:**

* **Sales of approximately $94.1 million**
* Working capital balance at quarter-end of approximately $107 million
* Operating cash flow of approximately $2.7 million during the quarter
* **Debt reduced 9% during the quarter**
* Quarter-end sales backlog volume 11% higher compared to prior year

“We continued to experience challenging conditions during the third fiscal quarter,” said Michael Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our margins were adversely affected by continued industry-wide pricing pressure and sales volume was dampened by political uncertainty and the holidays. On an encouraging note, our sales order activity surged following the presidential election and our latest commercial initiatives. We have seen continued strength in new order activity. At quarter-end, our sales backlog volume was 11% higher year over year. I remain confident in the long-term outlook for our industry, and I believe Friedman is well-positioned for success,” Taylor concluded.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 quarter”), the Company recorded a net loss of approximately $1.2 million ($0.17 diluted loss per share) on sales of approximately $94.1 million compared to net earnings of approximately $1.2 million ($0.16 diluted earnings per share) on sales of approximately $116.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 quarter”).

**FLAT-ROLL SEGMENT OPERATIONS**

Flat-roll product segment sales for the 2024 quarter totaled approximately $86.1 million compared to approximately $106.4 million for the 2023 quarter. The flat-roll segment had sales volume of approximately 105,000 tons from inventory and another 18,000 tons of toll processing for the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 110,000 tons from inventory and 22,000 tons of toll processing for the 2023 quarter. The average per ton selling price of flat-roll segment inventory decreased from approximately $960 per ton in the 2023 quarter to approximately $813 per ton in the 2024 quarter. Flat-roll segment operations recorded operating profits of approximately $1.3 million and $8.7 million for the 2024 quarter and 2023 quarter, respectively.

**TUBULAR SEGMENT OPERATIONS**

Tubular product segment sales for the 2024 quarter totaled approximately $7.9 million compared to approximately $9.5 million for the 2023 quarter. Sales volume for both the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter was approximately 8,000 tons. The average per ton selling price decreased from approximately $1,164 per ton in the 2023 quarter to approximately $1,013 per ton in the 2024 quarter. The tubular segment recorded operating losses of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the 2024 quarter and 2023 quarter, respectively.

**HEDGING ACTIVITIES**

We utilize hot-rolled coil (“HRC”) futures to manage price risk on unsold inventory and longer-term fixed price sales agreements. We typically account for our hedging activities under mark-to-market (“MTM”) accounting treatment and all hedging decisions are intended to protect the value of our inventory and produce more consistent financial results over price cycles. With MTM accounting treatment it is possible that hedging related gains or losses might be recognized in a different period than the corresponding improvement or contraction in our physical margins. For the 2024 quarter, we recognized a gain on hedging activities of approximately $0.3 million. The Company’s hedging activities were limited during the quarter due to a lack of price volatility.

**OUTLOOK**

The Company expects sales volume for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 to be higher than the third quarter volume due to stronger order activity and the impact of holidays on third quarter volume. HRC prices were stable at the start of the fourth quarter but began to increase at the time of this release. Most industry participants anticipate prices to increase further during the second half of the quarter. The Company expects fourth quarter sales margins to improve compared to the third quarter.

“Friedman remains in a strong financial position and ready to capitalize on both short-term and long-term opportunities” Taylor said. “I see favorable long-term demand for the industry and our products and believe we have a team uniquely qualified to recognize Friedman’s fullest potential.”
