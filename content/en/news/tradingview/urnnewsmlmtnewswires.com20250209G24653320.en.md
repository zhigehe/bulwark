Mitsui Fudosan's profit attributable to owners of the parent fell 13.5% to 144 billion yen in the fiscal nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from 166.4 billion yen a year ago.

The real estate company's revenue declined 1.3% to 1.677 trillion yen from 1.699 trillion yen a year earlier.

Mitsui Fudosan has revised its forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31 to reflect growth in overseas operations, brokerage income, and better-than-expected hotel and resort performance.
