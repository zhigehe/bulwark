Deutsche Bank is planning to appeal a monetary penalty of 10 million euros in Spain over its sale of derivatives, Bloomberg News reported Monday, citing a spokesperson for the German lender.

The statement follows the Spanish securities regulator CNMV's imposition of a fine on the bank after the latter's securities sale resulted in client losses. The report noted that the fine was one of the biggest in the regulator's history.

The spokesperson said Deutsche Bank could not comment further on the specifics of the matter but reiterated that it had already improved its processes and enhanced controls.

Deutsche Bank and CNMV did not immediately respond to requests for comments from MT Newswires.
