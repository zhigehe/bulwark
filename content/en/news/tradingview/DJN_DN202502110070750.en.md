The confirmation of new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. does not appear to be a concern for traders of CBOT grain futures — this even as U.S. grains are believed to be a prime target for any retaliatory tariffs from aggrieved nations like China. Owning corn in particular is seen as a hedge, says Tomm Pfitzenmaier of Summit Commodity Brokerage in a note. "The funds… continue to want to own corn as part of a strategy to own commodities as an inflation hedge with traders fearful that tariffs along with other Trump policies will be inflationary," he says. Funds are holding a huge long position in corn futures, signifying that they expect higher corn prices to come. Most-active corn is up 0.7%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
