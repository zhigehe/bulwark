European credit is likely to be a good source of income over the coming 12 months, BlackRock's James Turner and Simon Blundell say in a note. As the European Central Bank continues to cut interest rates and deposit rates fall, investors are likely to lower their cash holdings and invest in higher-yielding assets such as credit, BlackRock says. "Investors should look to step out of cash and increase allocations to fixed income to benefit from the higher yields," they say. European issuers remain in good financial health and strong demand for credit assets are likely to drive good performance in the asset class, BlackRock says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
