The FTSE 100 traded at record highs above 8,730 on Monday, driven by an 8.2% surge in BP shares after activist investor Elliott Management was reported to have built a stake in the company, aiming to address its underperformance.

BP shares hit their highest since August following the news.

Meanwhile, mining stocks faced pressure after former U.S. President Donald Trump pledged a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with potential retaliatory tariffs on countries taxing U.S. goods.

This follows his earlier tariffs on China, set to take effect at midnight on Sunday.

Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Antofagasta, and Glencore were down between 0.2%-0.7%.
