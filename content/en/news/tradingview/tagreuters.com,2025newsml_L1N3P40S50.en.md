Sterling rallied after markets' benign interpretation of unexpectedly strong U.S. PPI data weighed broadly on the dollar, but GBP/USD is still challenged to break out of recent ranges.

Markets took declines in certain PPI categories such as healthcare costs and airline fares as a sign of potential moderation in core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, bolstering rate-cut expectations and hurting the dollar broadly.

The problem for sterling is that its rise off the post-data NorAm low at 1.2454 ran into offers near the overnight high at 1.2515 that followed UK GDP and output beats in early European trade.

Sterling's failure rise above those highs reflects concerns over a host of global macro issues including still relatively firm Fed rate expectations, U.S. trade tariffs and reduced, but lingering, UK fiscal concerns.

While UK data beats lowered BoE rate cut odds, with futures pricing less than a 20% chance for a 25bp cut in March, the U.S. PPI data still provides no impetus for the Fed to hasten rate cuts.

That should keep GBP/USD capped by key Fib resistance at 1.2571 and the early-February tariff-related low by 1.2249.

Sterling bulls now look to upcoming UK employment data on Feb. 18 and UK price data on Feb. 19. Positive surprises could push GBP/USD past resistance at 1.2571- the 50% Fib of 1.3043-1.21, opening the door for a retest of early-Dec. highs above 1.28.
