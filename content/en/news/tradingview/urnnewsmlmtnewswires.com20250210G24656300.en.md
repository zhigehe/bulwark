The Hong Kong government will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US regarding its 10% additional tariffs against the city.

The tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump target mainland China.

A government spokesman said the tariffs are "grossly inconsistent" with WTO guidelines, adding the city is a separate customs territory from mainland China and is recognized by the WTO.
