Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson decided to discontinue the E.mbrace late-stage study of their investigational vaccine for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli due to its insufficient efficacy.

An independent interim analysis of the phase 3 data showed that the vaccine candidate was not effective enough in preventing invasive E. coli disease, according to a Thursday release. The clinical trial was launched in June 2021.

Paris-based Sanofi made $250 million in upfront and development milestone payments as part of the agreement with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit signed in October 2023.
