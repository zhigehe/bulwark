British American Tobacco's pledge to become a smokeless business by 2035 raises questions about its ability to replace the revenue and cash flow provided by the sale of cigarettes, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says in a note. The segment is what allows the tobacco company to reward shareholders with generous dividends and share buybacks, he says. The new category products, which includes vapes and e-cigarettes, had a contribution of 250 million pounds to adjusted operating profit in 2024, from a total of almost 12 billion pounds. "This clearly illustrates the size of the task over the next decade better than the company's observation that these areas of the business are now contributing some 17.5% of revenue," Mould adds. Shares are down 7.5% at 31.40 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)
