A consortium led by Exxon Mobil has requested environmental permits from Guyana for its eighth project, the first that will generate gas not linked to oil production, and to explore another well at its massive offshore block, the head of the U.S. oil major in Guyana said on Wednesday.

The Exxon group is getting ready for a very active year for exploration and production in Guyana following upgrades that increased the capacity of two of its three floating facilities and the expected arrival of a fourth vessel in the coming weeks, which will expand its total output capacity to around 940,000 barrels per day (bpd).

Guyana is pressing Exxon to produce and deliver more natural gas, part of the government's strategy to rely on the fuel for power generation, to industrialize the country and begin petrochemical and liquefied natural gas businesses that can expand revenue.

The consortium recently completed a long-awaited appraisal of its gas resources in the area, which will allow a more accurate calculation of total resources available for output, said Alistair Routledge, president of Exxon Guyana, in a press conference.

The study could help integrate Exxon's efforts with a massive development awarded by Guyana to Fulcrum LNG, aimed at designing and building the country's first LNG project.

Routledge said Exxon has not had recent conversations with the company.

In 2030, Exxon's eight project, dubbed Longtail, is expected to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of crude output capacity and 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas production.

Guyana's economy achieved its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth in 2024, expanding 43.6%, driven by oil production. Oil output rose to an average of 616,000 bpd from 391,000 bpd the previous year.
