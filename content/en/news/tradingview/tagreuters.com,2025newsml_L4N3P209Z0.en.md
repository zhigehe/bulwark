\*\* Shares of Indian tractor maker Escorts Kubota down 3.3% at 3,193 rupees

\*\* Of 17 analysts covering ESCO, four downgraded the co's stock rating and three cut TPs - according to data compiled by LSEG

GROWTH, MARKET SHARE WOES AMID RICH VALUATIONS

\*\* Ambit Capital ("sell", TP: 3349 rupees): Weak performance in tractor business makes the co a laggard in the industry, in terms of growth

\*\* Co's journey to increase exports 2-3x, market share to 18% (from current ~12%) may be long-drawn - Ambit

\*\* Asian Markets Securities (AMSEC) ("sell", TP: 2,900 rupees): Co plans to introduce Uber-like model for tractors to make it more affordable for small farmers

\*\* While co may be planning a strong transformative strategy to assist its mid- to long-term growth, current valuations seem rich to justify the near-term growth - AMSEC

\*\* BOB Capital Markets ("sell", raises TP to 2,533 rupees from 2,426 rupees) expects performance at co's other segment - construction equipment - to improve, says tractor business to continue facing hurdles on intense competition-led discounts
