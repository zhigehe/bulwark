US heating oil futures climbed toward $2.45 per gallon in February, rebounding from a near one-month low of $2.38 on February 5, as new U.S. sanctions on Iran’s crude exports heightened supply risks by targeting individuals and tankers transporting millions of barrels to China annually.

Gains were further supported by an EIA report showing a 5.5 million barrel draw in distillate inventories, more than three times the expected decline, tightening refined product availability.

However, an 8.7 million barrel crude build, far exceeding the anticipated 2.6 million barrel increase for the week ending January 31, alongside mounting concerns over a potential U.S.-China trade war and global demand outlook, limited further gains.
