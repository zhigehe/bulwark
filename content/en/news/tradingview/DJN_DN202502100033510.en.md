By Connor Hart

IDEAYA Biosciences named Joshua Bleharski as its top finance chief, effective in early May.

Bleharski most recently served as managing director and global co-head of biopharma at J.P. Morgan, the South San Francisco, Calif., company said Monday. He held various roles of increasing responsibility over his nearly 17 years at the financial-services firm.

Prior, Bleharski worked as a senior staff scientist at a private biotechnology company in San Diego and was a post-doctoral fellow at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology and the UCLA School of Medicine, the company said.

IDEAYA Biosciences said it expects to approve compensation terms of Bleharski, who is 50 years old, at a later date, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
