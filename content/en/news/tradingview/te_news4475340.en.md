WTI crude oil futures fell to around $73 per barrel on Wednesday, snapping a three-day gain after an industry report showed a sharp rise in US crude inventories.

API data revealed that US crude stocks surged by 9 million barrels last week, far exceeding the expected 2.8 million build, which would mark the largest increase in a year if confirmed by official data later today.

Traders also remained cautious amid escalating trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty.

Trump’s recent steel and aluminum tariffs could disrupt US oil drilling, which relies on specialty steel not produced domestically.

However, losses were limited by concerns over Russian and Iranian oil supply due to sanctions.

US sanctions imposed last month on tankers, producers, and insurers have disrupted Russian oil shipments to China and India, while new sanctions target networks shipping Iranian oil to China under Trump’s renewed “maximum pressure” campaign.
