Yields on Japanese government bonds with shorter maturities rose on Friday after a five-year bond auction saw a weak outcome.

The five-year yield (JP5YTN=JBTC) rose 0.5 basis point to 1.005%, after opening at 0.985%. The two-year JGB yield (JP2YTN=JBTC) climbed 0.5 bp to 0.795%.

The five-year bond auction received bids worth 3.52 times the amount sold, down from a ratio of 3.82 times at the previous auction.

"If the terminal rate of the Bank of Japan's policy rate is 1%, the current level of the five-year bond yield was not attractive," said Shiji Ebihara, chief fixed income strategist at Tokio Marine Asset Management.

The 10-year JGB yield (JP10YTN=JBTC) was flat at 1.35%, retreating from a nearly 15-year high of 1.37% scaled in the previous session.

Yields on the longer-dated bonds fell, with the 20-year JGB yield (JP20YTN=JBTC) slipping 0.5 bp to 2.01%. The 30-year JGB yield (JP30YTN=JBTC) fell 0.5 bp to 2.315%.

The 40-year JGB yield (JP40YTN=JBTC) fell 1.5 bps to 2.64%.
