PC Partner expects to report a net profit attributable to shareholders of no less than HK$250 million for the year ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, compared with HK$60 million a year earlier, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange on Thursday.

The increased profit is due to an improvement of gross profit margin driven by strong demand of a new series of video graphics cards.

The company will release its financial results before the end of February.

Singapore shares of the company slid over 7% in recent trading, while its Hong Kong shares shed over 4%.
