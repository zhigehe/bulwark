MDA Space shares rose Monday morning after the company signed a contract to become Globalstar's prime contractor for its satellite constellation for an added 750 million Canadian dollars ($524.7 million).

Shares traded 11% higher at C$24.23.

The announcement confirms the identity of a mystery client that MDA has been working with for over a year that began with a C$350 million authorization-to-proceed contract.

At the time, analysts widely believed the client to be Globalstar and technology company Apple, who are working together to deliver expanded services over a new mobile satellite-services network.

The new expanded deal includes a fresh satellite constellation, expanded ground infrastructure, and increased global MMS licensing.

MDA, a Brampton, Ontario-based space-technology company, is set to manufacture more than 50 MDA Aurora software-defined digital satellites for Globalstar's low-Earth-orbit constellation as part of its new deal.

The expanded agreement is worth C$1.1 billion.
