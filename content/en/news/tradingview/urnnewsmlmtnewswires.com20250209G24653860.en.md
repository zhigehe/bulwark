Santak Holdings expects to report a lower loss before tax for the fiscal first half ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, as compared to a year ago.

The company attributed the decrease in loss to a lower gross loss recorded and a drop in the selling, administrative and other expenses, and finance costs, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange on Friday.

However, despite an expected narrowed loss, the group is projected to log a lower revenue compared to the revenue in the year-ago period.

The manufacturer of precision machine components is expected to release its financial findings before mid-February, the filing added.
