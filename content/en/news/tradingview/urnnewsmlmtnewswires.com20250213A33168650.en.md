Crocs issued an upbeat full-year earnings outlook on Thursday as the shoemaker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.

The company anticipates per-share adjusted earnings to be in a range of $12.70 to $13.15 for 2025 on annual revenue growth of about 2% to 2.5%. The current consensus on FactSet is for non-GAAP EPS of $12.58 and sales of $4.16 billion. In the previous year, adjusted EPS gained 9.5% to $13.17 while revenue improved 3.5% to $4.1 billion.

"For 2025, we are expecting another year of revenue growth, led by mid-single-digit growth in the Crocs brand," Chief Executive Andrew Rees said in a statement. "We are pleased by the early signs of progress we made for HEYDUDE during the fourth quarter and are taking a prudent approach to how we shape 2025 guidance for HEYDUDE as we focus on reigniting the brand."

Crocs completed its $2.5 billion acquisition of casual footwear brand Heydude in 2022.

Revenue from the Crocs brand is pegged to rise by roughly 4.5% versus 2024, while HEYDUDE sales are projected to decline by 7% to 9% on a yearly basis. Shares of the company jumped 18% in Thursday trade.

For the December quarter, Crocs' adjusted EPS decreased to $2.52 from $2.58 the year before, but surpassed the Street's view for $2.26. Revenue inclined to $989.8 million from $960.1 million in the prior-year period, topping the average analyst estimate of $961.6 million. Sales from direct-to-consumer channels gained 5.5% while wholesale revenue edged down 0.2%.

"Our fourth-quarter performance exceeded expectations across all metrics led by Crocs Brand," according to Rees. "The North American business outperformed our plan and China growth accelerated from the third quarter."

Crocs brand sales were up 4% to $762.1 million, buoyed by a roughly 12% jump in the international segment that offset a 0.1% decrease in North America. HEYDUDE brand revenue remained nearly flat at $227.7 million, but "higher than anticipated as direct-to-consumer sales inflected to growth," Rees said.

Crocs expects adjusted EPS to come in between $2.38 and $2.52 for the ongoing three-month period, while the Street is currently looking for $2.63. Revenue is forecast to decline about 3.5% year over year, with the Crocs brand to be flat to down about 1% and HEYDUDE expected to drop roughly 14% to 16%. The market's view is for sales of $925.6 million for the quarter.
