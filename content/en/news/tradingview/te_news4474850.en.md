Stocks in the US remained lower on Tuesday, with the three major averages continuing to fall by about 0.3%, as Fed Chair Powell reaffirmed before Congress that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates.

He reiterated the pledge from the last FOMC meeting in January, when the central bank paused its rate-cut cycle.

Meanwhile, President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports with no exceptions or exemptions.

Shares of steel and aluminum producers rose, namely Cleveland-Cliffs (3.1%), US Steel Corp (1.2%), Nucor (2.5%) and Alcoa (1.6%).

Megacaps were mixed, with Apple gaining 1.6% and Alphabet adding 0.2% while Microsoft (-0.4%) and Meta (-0.5%) booked losses and Nvidia and Amazon traded around the flatline.

Tesla was down about 1.7%.

Meanwhile, the earnings season continues with shares of Coca-Cola rising more than 4% after the company's sales topped estimates.
