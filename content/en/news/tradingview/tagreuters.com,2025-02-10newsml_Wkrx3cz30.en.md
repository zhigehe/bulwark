BoMill AB announces that the company, together with the Finnish company GrainSense Oy, has received a grant from Eurostars. Both companies seek to disrupt the grain industry by developing a new state-of-the-art automatic high precision grain quality sorting and monitoring system. BoMill will receive a grant of SEK 5 million.

The collaboration between BoMill and GrainSense aims to integrate their technologies to create a new state-of-the-art, automated, high-precision grain quality monitoring and sorting system for large volumes of grain.

GrainSense is a Finnish Agtech company offering an innovative grain analysis solution featuring its patented NIR sensor. This sensor transforms traditional bulky Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy equipment into a compact and affordable solution. GrainSense technology is tailored for industrial, trading, research, and farming customers. It provides instant grain quality analysis such as protein, moisture, oil, and carbohydrate contents.

"We are keen to start our collaboration with GrainSense on this project. Our combined efforts will pave the way for a new era in grain sorting, benefiting our existing and future customers, commented Andreas Jeppsson, CEO of BoMill.

"We are excited to partner with BoMill on this groundbreaking project," said Riku Niemelä, CEO of GrainSense. "The EU funding will enable us to push the boundaries of grain sorting technology, ensuring higher precision and better outcomes for the entire grain supply chain."

Eurostars is part of the European Partnership for Innovative SMEs with support from the European Union through Horizon Europe. The project has a budget of approximately EUR 1.45 million and will run for 18 months. It is funded to approximately 50% by grants from Vinnova and Business Finland.
