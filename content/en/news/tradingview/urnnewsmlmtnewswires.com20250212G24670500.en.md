Idemitsu Kosan's profit attributable to owners of the parent fell nearly 47% to 127.5 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from 239.1 billion yen a year ago mainly due to higher costs and expenses.

The petroleum refinery's earnings per share dropped to 94.43 yen from 167.76 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing on Wednesday.

Net sales increased 7.4% to 6.876 trillion yen from 6.402 trillion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company raised its earnings forecast due to robust domestic margin in the petroleum segment and weaker yen.

Idemitsu Kosan forecasted attributable profit of 145 billion yen or 107.43 yen per share (from 125 billion yen or 90.64 yen per share previously) and net sales to gain 5.5% to 9.2 trillion yen (from 8.7 trillion yen) for the fiscal year ending March 31.

The company expects to pay a year-end dividend of 18.00 yen per share, bringing the total to 36.00 yen per share for the fiscal year.
