SHANGHAI, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — ECARX Holdings Inc. (“ECARX” or the “Company”), a global mobility tech provider, today announced that the first intelligent cockpit jointly developed under its strategic partnership with FAW Group Co., Ltd. (“FAW Group”), China’s leading automaker, will debut in the Hongqi Tiangong 05 all-electric sedan, which has been launched in January. This marks a significant milestone in the deepening strategic partnership signed in April 2024 with FAW Group to develop next-generation intelligent cockpits for its premium Hongqi brand of vehicles.

The Tiangong 05’s intelligent cockpit will be powered by ECARX’s Antora 1000 Pro computing platform and come integrated with customized Hongqi FAW OS on top of ECARX Cloudpeak and the recently upgraded ECARX AutoGPT in-vehicle AI large model application, setting a new industry benchmark with an immersive and AI-driven intelligent cockpit experience. To build this solution, ECARX and FAW combined their research and development capabilities and technological strengths over the past year to build an end-to-end value chain for the development of intelligent cockpits – from software and hardware design to system integration. This solution will be replicated and scaled across future Hongqi models, providing a highly cost-effective and streamlined solution that aligns seamlessly with evolving E/E architecture.

Ziyu Shen, Chairman and CEO of ECARX, commented, “Deploying our AI-driven intelligent cockpit solution in the Tiangong 05 is significant milestone in the journey we embarked on with FAW last year to bring rapid change, technical advancement, and innovation to the sector. In particular, the deep integration of ECARX AutoGPT with DeepSeek-R1 is set to redefine in-vehicle connectivity and performance, empowering more drivers with intuitive AI-driven solutions that align with the rapidly evolving demands of next-generation mobility. This will further broaden Antora series and AutoGPT’s appeal as the solution of choice for automakers globally, showcase our technological strengths, and further demonstrate our remarkable versatility to replicate and scale our solutions across various models.”
