MGM China Holdings' market-share gains and potential dividend payout could support near-term stability for the stock, according to Citi analysts in a research note. The Macau casino operator's 4Q net revenue grew about 3%, and the company reported record-high Ebitda for 2024, the analysts note. MGM's market share increased 0.9 percentage point on quarter to about 15.6% in 4Q. Citi expects MGM China's board to declare a final dividend in mid-March and maintain its around 50% payout ratio. The implied dividend yield of about 6% would provide investors with downside risk protection in the near term, the analysts say. Citi keeps a buy rating with a target price of HK$13.25. Shares closed 6.5% higher at HK$10.34. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
