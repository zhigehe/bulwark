South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 0.7% to close at 2539.05, with foreign and institutional investors being net buyers. Traders largely shrugged off President Trump's additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum--the latest in a series of tariff threats and impositions in the first few weeks of his second term. Some analysts suggest that markets may have either preemptively priced in the impact of these policies or view them as bargaining chips. Hyundai Steel ended flat. Earnings were also in focus, with howitzer maker Hanwha Aerospace jumping 21% after strong 4Q results. USD/KRW settled 0.1% higher at 1,452.60 in Seoul onshore trading. South Korea's 10-year government bond yield was down 0.8 bp at 2.822%. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)
