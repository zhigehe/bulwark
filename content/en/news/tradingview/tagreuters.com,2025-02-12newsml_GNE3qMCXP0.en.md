Innovative cloud surveillance solution allows for compliance with evolving regulations in cities nationwide

PALO ALTO, Ca, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cloudastructure, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Cloudastructure” or the “Company”), In response to new surveillance compliance regulations in a DC Metro municipality, a leading property management firm has chosen Cloudastructure, the cloud-based AI surveillance company, to ensure compliance for its affected properties. The firm has deployed Cloudastructure’s award-winning cloud video surveillance solution across all five of its multifamily communities subject to the new requirements, ensuring they meet the latest security mandates while enhancing overall safety and monitoring capabilities.
