Carrier Global Corporation, a global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. The company reported significant growth and provided an optimistic outlook for 2025.

**Financial Highlights**

Carrier's fourth quarter sales reached $5.1 billion, marking a 19% increase compared to the same period in 2023. The company achieved a GAAP EPS from continuing operations of ($0.05) and an adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.54, reflecting a 50% increase. The operating margin expanded by 250 basis points, with an adjusted operating margin expansion of 370 basis points.

For the full year 2024, Carrier reported sales of $22.5 billion, up 19% from the previous year. The GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.22, while the adjusted EPS was $2.56, up 16%. The company also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Carrier's HVAC segment saw an 11% organic sales increase in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance in the Americas, particularly in Commercial and North America Residential sectors. However, the Refrigeration segment experienced a 6% decline in organic sales, mainly due to decreases in North America truck and trailer sales.

The company completed its portfolio transformation in 2024, generating over $10 billion in divestiture proceeds. Additionally, Carrier successfully acquired and integrated Viessmann Climate Solutions, enhancing its global portfolio.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Carrier announced plans to exit its Fire & Security and Commercial Refrigeration businesses in 2023, with the divestitures completed in 2024. The company also repurchased approximately $1.9 billion in shares and paid around $0.7 billion in dividends to shareholders.

**Management's Perspective**

David Gitlin, Carrier's Chairman & CEO, highlighted the company's strong performance and successful portfolio transformation. He emphasized the acquisition of Viessmann Climate Solutions as a key factor in achieving a comprehensive and differentiated global portfolio. Gitlin expressed confidence in Carrier's ability to deliver strong results in 2025, supported by a growing global commercial HVAC backlog and a commitment to double-digit aftermarket growth.

**Future Outlook**

Carrier projects mid-single-digit organic growth for 2025, with reported sales expected to be between $22.5 billion and $23.0 billion. The company anticipates an adjusted operating margin of 16.5% to 17.0%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05. Free cash flow is projected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, with plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion in shares.
