Bellway is experiencing a pickup in the spring selling season after a subdued autumn, with the order book 30% ahead of a year ago, Peel Hunt analysts Sam Cullen and Clyde Lewis say in a note. The U.K. housebuilder is experiencing an encouraging improvement in demand levels despite consumers remaining sensitive to mortgage rates, the analysts say. The company expects to deliver at least 8,500 homes this year, with an average selling price of 310,000 pounds and underlying margins of 11%. This implies an underlying operating profit of around 290 million pounds which is 2% to 3% above Peel Hunt's forecasts. "Sustained improvements in affordability should help to drive demand forward, while outlets are beginning to return to net growth," the analysts say. Shares are down 5.5% at 2,422 pence.
