Key points:

* Trump raises tariffs on steel, aluminum imports
* Brazil's inflation rate slows in January
* Ecuador's bonds fall further
* MSCI Latam FX up 0.2%, stocks up 0.6%
* Egyptian, Jordanian bonds slide as Trump threatens to withhold aid

Latin American currencies and stocks edged up on Tuesday as selling pressure sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcements receded, while Brazil's real firmed after data pointed to elevated price pressures in the local economy.

Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a flat 25% and eliminated country exceptions, quota deals and product-specific exclusions, a move that drew condemnation from Canada, the EU and Mexico.

MSCI's index tracking Latin American currencies (.MILA00000CUS) was up 0.2%, while a stocks gauge (.MILA00000PUS) climbed 0.6%.

Currencies in Brazil and Mexico , among the biggest suppliers of steel to the United States, inched up 0.3% and 0.2% respectively, with the news already priced in following reports in the previous session.

Brazil's Bovespa rose 0.7%, although gains were limited by a 0.7% fall in steel heavyweight Vale , while Mexican stocks were weighed down by a 0.7% fall in miner Grupo Mexico .

Trump's plans to unveil reciprocal tariffs in the next two days also added some caution among investors in EM assets.

Aiding strength in Brazil's real, data showed domestic inflation slowed in January, but the 12-month rate was still above the upper end of the central bank's target range, keeping expectations intact for another rate rise next month.

"For now, we think that Marchâ€™s hike will mark the end of the tightening cycle, but the risks to our interest rate forecast lie firmly to the upside," said Kimberley Sperrfechter, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.

The Chilean peso was flat but stocks in the Chilean stock index were off 0.2%.

After five years of political upheaval, Chilean voters appear to be returning to traditional moderate conservatism in the run-up to a November presidential election, according to polls and political analysts, and this has helped the stock market in the world's largest copper producer to record highs.

Heavily influenced by oil exports, Colombia's peso dipped 0.1%, while its stocks (.COLCAP) gained 0.3%.

Dollar bonds in Ecuador (XS2214239175=TE) fell 3.4 cents, further declining after Monday's sharp losses as the first round of voting did not yield a winning presidential candidate, forcing the election to a second vote.

"Other than keeping uncertainty high, the wait could impact fundamentals too. It could leave fiscals looser or delay potential funding until the election uncertainty has cleared," analysts at Morgan Stanley said.

They said Ecuador's bonds hold value and look cheap compared to peers.

Analysts at BofA Global Research said that LatAm markets outperformed other emerging markets in January, attracting inflows from foreigners, despite broader EM funds seeing outflows.

Elsewhere, investors monitored developments in the Middle East.

Some Egyptian bonds (EG195305749=) logged their biggest daily drop in nearly two months after Trump said he could "conceivably withhold aid" for the country and Jordan if they didn't agree to take in Palestinians from Gaza as part of his plan for the U.S. takeover of the enclave. Some Jordanian bonds (418097AJ0=) also fell.

Peru's sol was flat, while local equities (.SPBLPGPT) dropped 0.7%, with Credicorp <BAP.LM> down 0.8% after reporting fourth-quarter net profit slightly below analysts' forecasts.
