Crude palm oil prices are likely to remain stable in February, hovering around between MYR4,500/ton to MYR5,000/ton. The prices are seen to be supported by restocking ahead of the Ramadan festive season as well as lower output, MIDF Research says in a note. January CPO average prices strengthened by 24% on year. Malaysia's palm oil output recovery is expected to be slow, with only 1% growth expected in 2025, due to biological tree rest and adverse weather, it adds. Large planters, such as IOI Corp., SD Guthrie, and Genting Plantations, could benefit from elevated CPO prices, it adds. MIDF maintains a tactical positive rating on the Malaysian plantation sector, expecting high CPO prices to persist at least until 1H. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
