St Barbara said it plans to separate its Atlantic gold operations from the Company, according to a Wednesday Australian bourse filing.

The Atlantic gold operations include the 15-Mile, Beaver Dam, and Cochrane Hill projects in Nova Scotia, Canada, the filing added.

After a portfolio review, the company concluded that this separation would maximize shareholder value by advancing Atlantic through development and permitting proposals under a Canadian firm with local leadership, per the filing.

The Atlantic gold operations have 1.4 million ounces in ore reserves and 2 million ounces in mineral resources, with significant potential due to the presence of production-ready infrastructure and exploration opportunities.

The company is exploring separation options including a sale, vend-in, or demerger and the company will focus on the Simberi Gold Operations in Papua New Guinea and the development of the Simberi sulfide expansion project.
