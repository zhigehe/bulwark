India's consumer inflation is expected to have eased to 4.5% on year in January, according to the median estimate of 12 economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. That compares with December's 5.22% rise. DBS Group Research economists believe broad-based deceleration in food prices and winter disinflation in staples and perishables likely dragged headline inflation lower. Core CPI, which excludes food and fuel, likely edged higher but remained below 4%, due to higher gold prices amid a weaker rupee, says Rahul Bajoria of BofAS India in a note. "So far, the impact of a weaker rupee is not visible in a generalized manner, but we remain cautious on the impact as it may take a few months to feed through," Bajoria adds. India's January CPI data are due Wednesday. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)
