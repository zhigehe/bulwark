Compass Minerals, a leading global provider of essential minerals, has released its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results. The company, known for its salt and plant nutrition products, has shown mixed performance in the latest quarter.

For the three months ended December 31,Â 2024, Compass Minerals reported:

* Revenue of $307.2 million, down from $341.7 million in the same period last year.
* Operating earnings of $0.5 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $53.6 million in the prior year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The company has made strides in reducing its North American salt inventory volumes, which declined by 10% year over year. Despite a slow start to the winter deicing season, the company remains optimistic about further inventory reductions in the coming months. In the Plant Nutrition segment, sales volumes increased by 36%, although the average sales price per ton decreased by 9% due to global supply conditions.

The company is also evaluating alternatives for its Fortress North America business, including ongoing discussions with the U.S. Forest Service regarding its fire retardant product, Qela.

**Management's Perspective**

Edward C. Dowling Jr., president and CEO, commented, "This quarter we began to see results from our back-to-basics strategy and initiatives to reduce inventory volumes, improve our cost structure, and enhance profitability. Our efforts are expected to further strengthen our future financial performance."
