BMO has cut its target on Alimentation Couche-Tard by $2, to $85 ahead of the company reporting its third-quarter results, likely in late-March.

Analyst Tamy Chen has also cut EPS estimate to $0.65 (from $0.79, Street is $0.76), reflecting a lower U.S. fuel margin forecast and reduced U.S. merchandise and fuel SSS.

The company remains low in BMO's pecking order given limited compelling positive catalysts near-term.

Maintain Outperform.
