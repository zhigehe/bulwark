Indian government bond yields inched lower on Friday as U.S. yields were off their recent highs, even as major focus remained on the fresh debt supply through the weekly auction.

The benchmark 10-year yield (IN067934G=CC) was at 6.7000%, as of 10:00 a.m. IST, compared with its previous close of 6.7103%.

The 10-year U.S. yield eased over 10 basis points overnight, after certain components in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for January pointed to lower inflation.

New Delhi is set to raise 390 billion rupees ($4.49 billion) through a sale of bonds, including 220 billion rupees of the benchmark security.

"Demand for the benchmark note at current levels would be an interesting cue for movement in the remaining part of the month," a trader with a state-run bank said.

The Reserve Bank of India bought bonds worth 400 billion rupees on Thursday, with nearly 50% consisting of debt with a duration of more than 10 years.

However, the cutoff yields at which the offers were accepted were higher than market estimates, which weakened sentiment as it indicated that banks were desperate to clear their stock, traders said.

The RBI will conduct a 49-day repo for 750 billion rupees later in the day, followed by its last scheduled OMO purchase of bonds worth 200 billion rupees on February 20.

"Another positive trigger could come in the form of the RBI increasing the quantum of next week's OMO auction like they did for this week," the trader added.

The RBI has bought bonds worth 988.35 billion rupees through auctions and secondary purchases, infused 500 billion rupees through a 56-day repo and around 440 billion rupees via a dollar/rupee swap in the last one month.

As the mega liquidity infusion package nears its end, investors will also eye the central bank's next set of measures, as liquidity is set to tighten further into the financial year-end in March.
