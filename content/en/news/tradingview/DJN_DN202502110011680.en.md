By Adam Whittaker

BP's profit fell more than expected as weak refining margins dragged on its results but the British energy major still launched a $1.75 billion quarterly buyback.

The British oil and gas giant reported an underlying replacement cost profit--a similar metric to net income that U.S. oil companies report--of $1.17 billion for the fourth quarter. This compared with $1.26 billion analysts had expected, according to a company-compiled consensus, and $2.27 billion reported in the third quarter.

It said it would review its 2025 buyback target and announce its expectations as part of its capital markets day scheduled for April 26.
