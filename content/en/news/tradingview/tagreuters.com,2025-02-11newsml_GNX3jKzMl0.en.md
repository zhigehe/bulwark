HAZARD, Ky. and FRANKFORT, Ky. and DANVILLE, Ky. and LANCASTER, Ky., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Kentucky First Federal Bancorp , the holding company (the “Company”) for First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard and First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky, Frankfort, Kentucky, announced net income of $13,000 or $0.00 diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $361,000 or $(0.05) diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $374,000 or 103.6%. A net loss of $2,000 or $(0.00) diluted earnings per share was announced for the six months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a net loss of $536,000 or $(0.07) diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $534,000 or 99.6%.

The increase in net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher net interest income. Net interest income increased $381,000 or 23.0% to $2.0 million due primarily to interest income increasing more than interest expense increased period to period. Interest income increased $857,000 or 21.8% to $4.8 million, while interest expense increased $476,000 or 21.0% to $2.7 million for the recently-ended quarter. While the rising interest rate environment has slowed and market rates have even decreased, the repricing level of our assets has begun to outpace the increase in expenses paid on liabilities.

The average rate earned on interest-earning assets increased 80 basis points to 5.28% and was the primary reason for the increase in interest income, although average interest-earning assets also increased $11.5 million or 3.3% to $362.3 million for the recently-ended quarterly period. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 44 basis points to 3.53% and was the primary reason for the increase in interest expense, although average interest-bearing liabilities also increased $17.3 million or 5.9%.

Non-interest income increased $125,000 or 271.7% and totaled $171,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2024, almost entirely due to net gains on sales of loans increasing $74,000 compared to December 31, 2023. This was due to the increase in demand for fixed -rate secondary market loans.

Non-interest expense also increased $54,000 period to period primarily due to other non-interest expense increasing $123,000, with the majority of this due to increased professional fees. This increase was partially offset by employee compensation and benefits decreasing $62,000 or 4.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

At December 31, 2024, assets totaled $374.2 million, a decrease of $760,000 or 0.2%, from $375.0 million at June 30, 2024, due primarily to the decrease in loans, net, of $2.8 million or 0.8%, as well as a decrease in investment securities of $1.0 million or 10.6% primarily because of principal repayments and prepayments. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $21.0 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 14.7% compared to June 30, 2024. Total liabilities decreased $818,000 or 0.3% to $326.2 million at December 31, 2024, as consistent with our efforts to reduce our reliance on higher cost funding sources, FHLB advances decreased $7.2 million or 10.4% to $61.8 million. Partially offsetting the decrease in FHLB advances was an increase in total deposits of $6.9 million or 2.7% at December 31, 2024. Savings account deposits increased $1.6 million or 3.4%, and certificates of deposit increased $10.3 million or 5.9%.

At December 31, 2024, the Company reported its book value per share as $5.94. Shareholders’ equity increased $58,000 or 0.1% to $48.1 million at December 31, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily associated with accumulated other comprehensive loss decreasing $60,000 at December 31, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 as the unrealized losses on our investment portfolio decrease.
