Indian government bond yields are expected to be flat in early deals on Wednesday, as market participants await inflation prints in India and the U.S. for cues on their interest rate trajectories.

The benchmark 10-year yield (IN067934G=CC) is likely to move between 6.67% and 6.71%, a trader with a private bank said, compared with Tuesday's close of 6.6983%.

"Bonds should be rangebound today, with some underlying caution as U.S. yields are moving up amid tariff uncertainty and after comments from Federal Reserve on rates."

India's consumer inflation likely fell sharply to a five-month low of 4.60% in January, from 5.22% in December on slowing food price rises, according to a Reuters poll.

This would be followed by inflation data in the U.S., which is likely to be 0.3% on a monthly basis and up 2.9% for 12 months to January.

U.S. yields moved higher overnight, with the 10-year yield crossing 4.50% mark after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is not in a rush to cut rates.

"We are in a pretty good place with this economy."

The U.S. interest rate futures market priced in about 35 basis points of easing this year, with the first rate reduction now seen at the July or September meetings. Earlier, futures had priced more than an even chance of easing in June.

Any large upmove in bond yields is unlikely after the Reserve Bank of India doubled the quantum for purchase of securities that is due on Thursday to 400 billion rupees ($4.61 billion).

The RBI's heavy intervention in the forex market could have been the primary reason for raising its debt purchases, traders said.

The RBI has bought bonds worth 588.35 billion rupees through auction and secondary purchases, infused 500 billion rupees through a 56-day repo and around 440 billion rupees through a dollar/rupee swap so far.

KEY INDICATORS:

\*\* Brent crude futures were up down 0.3% at $76.75 per barrel, after rising 1.5% in the previous session

\*\* Ten-year U.S. Treasury yield at 4.5393%; two-year yield (US2YT=RR) at 4.2917%

\*\* RBI to auction treasury bills worth 280 billion rupees

\*\* RBI to conduct 1-day variable rate repo auction for 2.50 trillion rupees

($1 = 86.6920 Indian rupees)
