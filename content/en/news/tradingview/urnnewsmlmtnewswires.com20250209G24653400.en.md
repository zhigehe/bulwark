Lachlan Star identified a priority near-term drilling target at its Junee copper project in New South Wales, after receiving results from an induced polarization geophysical survey, according to a filing on the Australian bourse on Monday.

The target is located to the north of recent copper intercepts at the Basin Creek prospect at the project.

The data showed a large-scale chargeable anomaly extending across the prospect, and its northern extension represents a high-priority exploration target.

The chargeable anomaly aligns closely with previous copper-in-soil results and the firm plans to conduct further exploration.
