Hain Celestial Group, a leading global health and wellness company, has released its financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31,Â 2024. The company reported strong operating cash flow and a reduction in debt, despite facing challenges in sales growth due to poor in-store performance in snacks and supply chain issues.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fiscal second quarter, Hain Celestial reported net sales of $411 million, a 9% decrease year-over-year. Organic net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, discontinued brands, and exited product categories, decreased by 7%. The company posted a net loss of $104 million, significantly higher than the $14 million net loss in the prior year period, primarily due to non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $107 million.

Gross profit margin increased by 20 basis points to 22.7%, while adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 60 basis points to 22.9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, down from $47 million in the prior year period, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.2% compared to 10.4% previously. Loss per diluted share was $1.15, compared to $0.15 in the prior year period, while adjusted EPS was $0.08, down from $0.12.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Hain Celestial's North America segment saw a 9% year-over-year decline in organic net sales, driven by lower sales in snacks and personal care. The International segment experienced a 4% decline in organic net sales, primarily due to lower sales in meal prep and short-term service challenges. The company reported sequential improvement in the baby & kids category and its largest category, meal prep.

Segment gross profit for North America was $57 million, an 8% decrease from the prior year period, while adjusted gross profit was $58 million, a 13% decrease. The International segment's gross profit was $37 million, a 9% decrease, with adjusted gross profit also at $37 million, down 9% from the prior year period.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Hain Celestial is exploring strategic options for its personal care business to focus on better-for-you food and beverages. The company aims to simplify its business and create long-term value for shareholders. Additionally, Hain Celestial has made significant progress in stabilizing its personal care business, driving sequential improvement in gross margin and sales trends in core channels of natural and e-commerce.

**Management's Perspective**

Wendy Davidson, President and CEO, highlighted the company's strong operating cash flow and debt reduction efforts. She acknowledged the challenges faced in the quarter but expressed confidence in the actions taken to address marketing and supply chain issues. Davidson emphasized the company's focus on disciplined execution and the potential for organic net sales growth in the second half of the year.

Lee Boyce, CFO, noted that commercial execution and supply chain challenges impacted the second quarter results. However, he remains optimistic about the company's position to pivot to growth in the latter half of the year, supported by recent distribution wins and the recovery of infant formula supply.

**Future Outlook**

Hain Celestial has revised its guidance for fiscal 2025, expecting organic net sales growth to be down 2 to 4%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be flat year-over-year, with gross margin expected to increase by at least 90 basis points. Free cash flow is projected to be at least $60 million.
