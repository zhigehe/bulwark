Nestle's turnaround efforts will take time to pay off amid a challenging cost backdrop, Barclays analysts say in a research note. The Swiss maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee is likely to face questions on its profitability in light of cost inflation, the analysts say. The company expects underlying trading operating profit margin to be 16% or above this year. However, the key issue is how to square that target with rising cost inflation and advertising-and-promotional spending that is increasing slowly, according to Barclays. "Nestle is making early progress but the inflation and consumer backdrop remain challenging," the analysts say. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)
