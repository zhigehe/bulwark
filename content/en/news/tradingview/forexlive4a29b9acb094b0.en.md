There are quite a number of large ones to watch out for, as highlighted in bold.

The first ones are for EUR/USD with some large bookends at 1.0400 and 1.0500 in particular. In between that, there are also some larger ones layered between 1.0435 through to 1.0475 on the day.

The dollar is in a weak spot this week as traders have largely shrugged off tariff fears, as evident by the reaction even to Trump's reciprocal tariffs yesterday. That is putting the near-term bias in favour of buyers. As such, the expiries above should offer some pull in keeping price action more underpinned in the session ahead.

The ones at 1.0500 is likely to keep a lid on things, holding at the January highs as well.

Then, there is one for USD/JPY at the 152.00 level. The pair is contesting with its 200-day moving average of 152.68, so that's the bigger draw at the moment. The expiries might not see much impact unless the bond market also plays ball, which usually only comes closer to US trading as seen yesterday.

There's also one for USD/CAD at the 1.4200 level but I wouldn't attach too much significance to it. It could help to draw in price action if risk sentiment is more tentative in European trading. However, the figure level doesn't offer any technical significance at this stage. The break below the support region of 1.4260-80 has freed up plenty of room to the downside for the pair with 1.4100 eyed next.

And lastly, there is one for AUD/USD at the 0.6300 level. The pair itself is nudging close to the January high of 0.6330 and that's the more crucial technical point to watch now. As such, the expiries might not feature much into play besides the potential to hold price action thereabouts in the meantime.

But if risk starts running again and the bond market also starts moving, those will be bigger drivers of trading sentiment as we look to close out the week.
