Anterix shares gained after the company said it is starting a strategic-review process to capitalize on growing demand for its products.

The stock rose 27% to $36.17 Tuesday morning. Shares are now up about 13% over the past year.

The Woodland Park, N.J., broadband-services provider has engaged Morgan Stanley to help advise on the review, which is intended to meet growing demand and urgency among the utility industry for private wireless broadband solutions, Anterix said Tuesday.

Anterix is also launching an effort to allow customers to deploy 900 MHz private wireless broadband networks more quickly. As part of the initiative, the company plans to review pricing, payment and ownership terms, and consider strategic partners on additional products and services.

Anterix is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday morning.
