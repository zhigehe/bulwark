Lindian Resources appointed Henk Ludik as a corporate finance advisor reporting directly to the board, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

Ludik will work with the Gerald Group to advance a binding term sheet in relation to a nonbinding $50 million stage-one funding and offtake package. He will also identify, review, and recommend other funding opportunities, the filing said.

The firm said it received multiple funding inquiries to help progress the development of its Kangankunde rare earths project in Malawi.
