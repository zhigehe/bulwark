US biotechnology company Illumina is in discussion with authorities after being added to China's unreliable entity list for allegedly breaching fair market rules, Yicai Global reported on Feb. 7, citing the company's spokesperson.

The company was placed on the Chinese Commerce Ministry's list after cutting ties with Chinese firms, a move that affected the firms' legitimate rights and interests, following President Donald Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese imports, the report said.

The spokesperson told Yicai in a statement that Illumina is seeking solutions in its talk with authorities, the report said.
