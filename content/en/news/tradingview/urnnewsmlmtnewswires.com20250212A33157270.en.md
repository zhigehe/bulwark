Eminent Gold on Wednesday said it completed its acquisition of a 100% interest in the Celts Project in Nevada for US$400,000.

The vendors will also receive a 3% net smelter returns (NSR) royalty, including on any future claims that Eminent stakes within a kilometer of the Celts Project, and an additional 1.5% NSR royalty for certain claims, should Eminent acquire them. The NSR Royalty may be reduced to 2% for a cash payment of US$1.5 million.

"We are very enthusiastic about advancing the Celts Project as it represents a rare opportunity to explore a remarkable analogue to the recent AngloGold Ashanti Silicon discovery," said Dan McCoy, chief geologist.

Eminent was last seen up $0.01 to $0.48 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
