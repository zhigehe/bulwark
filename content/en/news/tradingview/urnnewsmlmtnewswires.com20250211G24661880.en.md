At least five small and medium-sized banks in China are offering higher returns on one-year deposit products compared with two-year deposit products, Yicai Global reported Monday.

The move is seen as unconventional as banks usually encourage depositors to put their money longer in banks for higher returns, the report said.

Among the banks following this practice are Shuozhou Rural Commercial Bank, which is offering 30 basis points higher on its one-year time deposit product compared with its two-year product, the report said. The bank's three-year product is 25 basis points higher compared with its five-year product, the report said.

The move is not unprecedented in China as a number of small and medium-sized commercial lenders modified their rates, Yicai said.

The offerings are more attractive to rural residents sensitive to interest rate changes, while banks may also get more new clients and maintain stable risks for longer-term products, the report said, citing a rural commercial banking insider.
