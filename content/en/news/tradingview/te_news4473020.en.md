Aluminum futures posted modest gains, holding above $2,640 per tonne, after President Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the US. While Trump stated that the tariffs would apply to all countries, he did not specify when they would take effect.

The US relies on imports for nearly half of its aluminum consumption, with Canada being the largest supplier, followed by the UAE. In 2018, during his first term as president, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns.

Meanwhile, aluminum prices were already trending higher, tracking broad gains in base metals as supply concerns and improving manufacturing indicators supported demand expectations.

In China, aluminum production hit a record 44 million tons in 2024, approaching the government-imposed cap of 45 million tons set in 2017 to curb excess supply and support carbon emissions targets.
