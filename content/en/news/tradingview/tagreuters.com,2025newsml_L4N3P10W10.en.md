Gold hit a record high above $2,900 per ounce on Monday as fears of a potential global trade war, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcements, sent investors scurrying towards the precious metal.

Bullion prices have smashed records seven times already this year, and are up more than 10%, with market bulls eyeing $3,000 per ounce as the next psychological level to breach.

Here are the different way to invest in gold:

SPOT MARKET

Large buyers and institutional investors usually buy gold from big banks. Prices in the spot market are determined by real-time supply and demand dynamics.

London is the most influential hub for the spot gold market, largely because of the London Bullion Market Association. The association sets standards for gold trading and provides a framework for the over-the-counter market, facilitating trades among banks, dealers, and institutions.

China, India, the Middle East and the United States are other major gold trading centres.

FUTURES MARKET

Investors can also get exposure to gold via futures exchanges, where people buy or sell a particular commodity at a fixed price on a particular date in future.

COMEX (Commodity Exchange Inc), part of the New York Mercantile Exchange, is the largest gold futures market in terms of trading volumes.

Shanghai Futures Exchange, China's leading commodities exchange, also offers gold futures contracts. The Tokyo Commodity exchange, popularly known as TOCOM, is another big player in the Asian gold market.

EXCHANGE TRADED PRODUCTS

Exchange traded products or exchange traded funds issue securities backed by physical metal and allow people to gain exposure to gold prices without taking delivery of the metal itself.

Exchange traded funds have become a major category of investment demand for the precious metal.

Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds registered a modest net inflow of $3.4 billion in 2024, their first inflow in four years, even though their holdings fell by 6.8 metric tons, the World Gold Council said.

BARS AND COINS

Retail consumers can buy gold from metals traders selling bars and coins in an outlet or online. Gold bars and coins are both effective means of investing in physical gold.

DRIVERS:

INVESTOR INTEREST AND MARKET SENTIMENT

Rising interest from investment funds in recent years has been a major factor behind bullion's price moves.

Sentiment driven by market trends, news, and global events can lead to speculative buying or selling of gold.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

Gold is a popular hedge against currency market volatility. It has traditionally moved in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since weakness in the U.S. currency makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and vice versa.

MONETARY POLICY AND POLITICAL TENSIONS

The precious metal is widely considered a "safe haven" during times of uncertainty.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of trade tariffs - and his imposition of additional duties on Chinese goods - have led to fears of a global trade war, rattling currency markets and sparking fears of a spike in U.S. inflation

Trump announced plans to impose fresh 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports on Sunday, as well as reciprocal tariffs targeting imports from a wide range of countries.

Policy decisions from global central banks also influence gold's trajectory. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold since it pays no interest.

CENTRAL BANK GOLD RESERVES

Central banks hold gold as part of their reserves. Central bank demand has been robust in recent years because of ongoing macroeconomic and political uncertainty.

More central banks plan to add to their gold reserves within a year despite high prices for the precious metal, the World Gold Council said in its annual survey in June.

Global gold demand, including over-the-counter trading, rose by 1% to a record high in 2024, the World Gold Council said, adding that central banks sped up buying in the fourth quarter.
