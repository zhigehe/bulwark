Japanese stocks edged higher on Thursday as accelerating wholesale inflation reinforced expectations of a near-term rate hike.

The Nikkei 225 gained 1.28%, or 497.77 points, to close at 39,461.47.

Japan's wholesale inflation rose to 4.2% in January, its fifth straight month of acceleration. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warned rising food costs could shape inflation expectations.

The corporate goods price index (CGPI) topped forecasts, with price gains in food, textiles, plastics, and metals. Import prices in yen climbed 2.3% from a year earlier, up from 1.4% in December, as the weak currency kept pressure on costs.

In other data, producer prices hit a 20-month high, rising 4.2% on-year, led by food, fuel, and transport costs. Utility bills soared over 11%, while agricultural prices surged more than 36%.

On the corporate front, Zensho Holdings reported a 56% jump in nine-month profit to 34.1 billion yen, driven by recovering foot traffic and economic normalization.

Earnings per share rose to 209.89 yen from 141.10 yen, while net sales climbed 20% to 846.8 billion yen.

Toray Industries posted a 65% surge in nine-month profit to 75.2 billion yen, with EPS rising to 46.92 yen from 28.51 yen. Revenue grew 5.2% to 1.924 trillion yen.

Chiome Bioscience said research on its Tribody cancer immunotherapy, conducted with Italy's Ceinge-Biotecnologie Avanzate, was published in Cell Death Discovery.

The study explored a multi-specific antibody integrating PD-L1, PD-1, LAG3, and a T-cell engager targeting tumor-associated antigen 5T4.
