Oil prices rose early on Monday, rebounding from three days of losses as U.S President Donald Trump promised to impose a 25% tariff on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum.

West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery was last seen up US$0.96 to US$71.96 per barrel, while April Brent crude up US$0.98 to US$75.64.

Trump on Sunday said the new levies will take effect today, adding to a 10% tariff imposed on imports from China and continuing threats to impose 25% levies on imports from Canada and Mexico after last week postponing them by 30 days. He is also threatening new tariffs on imports from the European Union.

Trump's seemingly impulsive decisions on tariffs, combined with a disruptive domestic agenda, has been supportive of equities, but commodities have been more sensitive to the administration's threats to raise costs for international producers and U.S. consumers.

"The gap between equities and oil keeps widening. Last year was characterized by an equity bull market where the US outperformed the rest of the world. The MSCI All-Country Index returned 16% and the Nasdaq Composite Index 29%. The US crude oil benchmark, WTI, on the other hand, was flat," PVM Oil Associates noted.

Rising U.S. inventories are also offering a check to oil prices, with the Energy Information Agency last week saying U.S. oil stocks were up by 8.7-million barrels. OPEC+ last week also confirmed plans to boost supply with 18 monthly additions of 122,000 barrels per day beginning in April.
