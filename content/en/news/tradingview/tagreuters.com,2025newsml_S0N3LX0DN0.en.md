A federal judge has ordered the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to restore funding for hundreds of foreign aid contractors who say they have been devastated by his 90-day blanket freeze, Politico reported late on Thursday.

“At least to date, defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs,” U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, a Washington, D.C.-based appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote in a filing, according to Politico.
