The date for settlement for Tranche 1 is expected to be on or about 17February2025 and settlement for Tranche 2 is expected to be on or about 10 March 2025.

The following close associates ("PCAs") to persons discharging managerialresponsibilities have conducted the following transactions in the PrivatePlacement (a PCA notification form will be published in a separate stockexchange notice):

Subsequent repair offering and equal treatment considerations:

Completion of the Private Placement implies a deviation from the pre-emptiverights of the existing shareholders of the Company under the Norwegian PublicLimited Companies Act. When resolving the issuance of the Offer Shares in thePrivate Placement, the Board has considered the Private Placement in light ofthe equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Actsection 5-14, section 2.1 of Euronext Oslo Rule Book II and Oslo Børs'Circularno. 2/2014, and is of the opinion that the proposed Private Placement is incompliance with these requirements. By structuring the Private Placement as aprivate placement, with a Subsequent Offering (as defined below), the Companywas able to complete the transaction in an efficient manner to strengthen theCompany's balance sheet. On this basis, and based on an assessment of thecurrent equity markets, the Company's need for equity funding, deal executionrisk and possible alternatives, the Board has considered the Private Placementto be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders. As aconsequence of the overall transaction structure, the shareholders'preferentialrights will be deviated from.

To mitigate the dilution of existing shareholders not participating in thePrivate Placement, the Board has resolved to undertake a subsequent repairoffering (the "Subsequent Offering") of up to 12,000,000 new shares which,subject to applicable securities law, will be directed towards existingshareholders in the Company as of 12 February 2025 (as registered in the VPStwotrading days thereafter), who (i) were not included in the pre-sounding phaseofthe Private Placement, (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares in the PrivatePlacement, and (iii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offeringwould be unlawful or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require anyprospectus, filing, registration or similar action (the "EligibleShareholders"). The subscription price in the Subsequent Offering will beequalto the Offer Price. The Eligible Shareholders will receive non-transferrablesubscription rights in the Subsequent Offering.

The Subsequent Offering is subject to (i) completion of the Private Placement,(ii) the Board resolving to issue shares in the Subsequent Offering pursuanttoan authorisation granted by the EGM, (iii) the publication of an offering andlisting prospectus pertaining to the Subsequent Offering and (iv) theprevailingmarket price and trading volume of the Company's shares following the PrivatePlacement. The Board may decide that the Subsequent Offering will not becarriedout in the event that the Company's shares trade at or below the subscriptionprice (i.e. the Offer Price) in the Subsequent Offering at trading volumesequalto or above the number of shares in the Subsequent Offering.

Further information regarding the Subsequent Offering will be announced inseparate stock exchange notices.
