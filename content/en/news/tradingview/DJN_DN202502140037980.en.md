* Semiconductor company Arm Holdings plans to launch its own chip this year, in a departure from the SoftBank-owned group's business model, the Financial Times reports citing sources familiar with the company's plans.
* Arm making its own chips is just one step in among larger plans to move into AI chip production, and the company will roll out its first in-house chip as early as this summer, the sources tell the FT.
* The chip is expected to be a central processing unit for large data-centre servers, and the chips' base can be customised for clients including Meta. Production will be outsourced to a manufacturer like TSMC, the FT reports, citing the sources.
* Arm, SoftBank and Meta declined to comment to the FT.
