The annual producer inflation in Macedonia increased to 6.1% in December 2024, up from 5.5% in the previous month.

This marked the eight consecutive month of rising producer prices and the highest level since February 2023.

This was mainly driven by higher prices for consumer goods (7.2% vs 6.3% in November), particularly durable goods (9.2% vs 6.2%) and non-durable goods (7% vs 6.3%).

Meanwhile, price growth slowed marginally for capital goods (11.4% vs 11.7%) and energy (12.9% vs 13.1%).

At the same time, costs dropped at a slower pace for intermediate goods excluding energy (-7% vs -7.7%).

On a monthly basis, producer prices rose by 0.3% in December, following a 0.6% advance in November.

In 2024, producer inflation stood at 1.5%.
