Light & Wonder's US unit Light and Wonder International (L&WI), amended its credit agreement to increase revolving credit commitments to AU$1 billion, up from AU$750 million, according to a Tuesday filing with the Australian bourse.

The amendment, dated Feb. 10, extends the maturity to Feb. 10,Â 2030, and reduces the interest margin for revolving loans to between 2% and 1.5% per annum, based on certain benchmarks, the filing said.
