Enechange borrowed 19 million yen under its EV charging commitment line, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

It secured 10 million yen from SMBC for EV Juden Infra Ichigo and 9 million yen—split between 2 million yen from SMBC and 7 million yen from Aozora Bank —for EV Juden Infra Nigo.

The funds will be used for subsidiary operations.

The loan, due March 31, carries an interest rate based on JBA TIBOR plus a spread and is secured against deposit receivables. Enechange has drawn 3.54 billion yen from the 5.7 billion yen facility since October 2024 and plans further monthly borrowings.

Enechange shares were down 1% in recent trade.
