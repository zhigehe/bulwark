(1)   Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date (as defined below) and accepted for purchase by the Company.

(2)   Does not include Accrued Interest (as defined below), which will also be payable as described below.

(3)   The applicable page on Bloomberg from which the dealer manager will quote the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security is FIT1.

The Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated February 10, 2025 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or decrease any or all of the Series Notes Caps and/or the Aggregate Notes Cap in its sole discretion at any time without extending or reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law.

The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 11, 2025, or any other date and time to which the Company extends the applicable Tender Offer (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the “Expiration Date”), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 24, 2025 (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the “Early Tender Date”), and the holder’s Notes must be accepted for purchase, to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below). If a holder validly tenders Notes after the applicable Early Tender Date but prior to or at the applicable Expiration Date, and the holder’s Notes are accepted for purchase, the holder will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below).

Subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap, the Series Notes Caps and proration, if applicable, the total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to each Tender Offer will be calculated in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable Fixed Spread for such Notes specified in the table above plus the applicable yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on February 25, 2025 (excluding Accrued Interest with respect to each series of Notes, the “Total Consideration”). The Total Consideration includes an applicable early tender premium per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase as set forth in the table above (with respect to each series of Notes, the “Early Tender Premium”). Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase will receive the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium (with respect to each series of Notes, the “Tender Offer Consideration”).

In addition to the consideration described above, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the applicable settlement date (“Accrued Interest”).

The Company intends to fund the purchase of validly tendered and accepted Notes with available cash on hand and other sources of liquidity. The purpose of the Tender Offers is to purchase a portion of the Notes, subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap and the Series Notes Caps, in order to reduce the Company’s total outstanding public debt.

The Tender Offers will expire on the applicable Expiration Date. Except as set forth below, payment for the Notes that are validly tendered prior to or at the Expiration Date and that are accepted for purchase will be made on a date promptly following the Expiration Date, which is currently anticipated to be March 14, 2025, the third business day after the Expiration Date. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make payment for Notes that are validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date and that are accepted for purchase on an earlier settlement date, which, if applicable, is currently anticipated to be February 27, 2025, provided that the conditions to the satisfaction of the applicable Tender Offer are satisfied. The Company is not obligated to conduct any early settlement or have any early settlement occur on any particular date.

Tendered Notes may be withdrawn prior to or at, but not after, 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 24, 2025.

The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions which are specified in the Offer to Purchase. The Tender Offers are not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered.
