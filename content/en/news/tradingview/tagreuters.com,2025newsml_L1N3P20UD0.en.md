The Bank of Canada said on Tuesday it had appointed Michelle Alexopoulos as its second external deputy governor, expanding its rate-setting team to seven members.

Alexopoulos will serve a two-year term starting March 17 and will be the second external deputy governor after Nicolas Vincent, who was appointed in early 2023.

The bank had initiated a process to bring in outside perspectives to its monetary policy decision making when it changed the fourth Deputy Governor position to an external, non-executive role two years ago.

Last year in October, the bank said it would add one more external seat to its governing council , mainly to bring in varied perspectives in making policy decisions and streamline management responsibility.

"Alongside other members of the Council, Dr. Alexopoulos will also be responsible for communicating with Canadians about the Bank's policy decisions and its outlook for the economy and inflation," the bank said in a statement.

Alexopoulos, who is a professor of economics at the University of Toronto, holds a PhD in economics and is an expert in technical change, macroeconomics and applied econometrics, her profile on BoC's official website said.
