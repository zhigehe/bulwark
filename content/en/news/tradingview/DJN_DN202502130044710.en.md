0913 GMT - Oil prices extend the previous trading session's losses on news that U.S. President Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to open talks to end the war in Ukraine. Brent crude is down 0.5% to $74.80 a barrel, while WTI falls 0.6% to $70.97 a barrel. Both benchmarks closed more than 2% lower on Wednesday, pressured by prospects of lower supply risks and speculation over a potential easing of restrictions on Russian producers. Meanwhile, hotter-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. is also weighing on sentiment, upholding the Federal Reserve's more cautious stance on interest-rate cuts. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)

0907 GMT - Delivery Hero's full-year 2025 guidance points to another year of improved profitability and cash flow generation, Jefferies analysts write. The guidance is well-aligned with consensus expectations, they say. The German food-delivery company comfortably met its full-year 2024 guidance after a strong fourth-quarter, they write. Delivery Hero reported a slowdown in growth in Asia but this was not a surprise to investors, they write. The company is expected to use its call with analysts later in the day to explain its turnaround strategy in South Korea, the analysts add. Shares trade up 6.6% at 28.01 euros.

0845 GMT - The euro's gains could have further to run on optimism over a ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, ING analyst Chris Turner says in a note. "Progress on peace in Ukraine could be an important positive for European countries should it deliver lower energy prices and encourage broader investment on the back of something like a new Marshall Plan," he says. However, the threat of U.S. tariffs on Europe could limit the euro's appreciation. Sticky U.S. inflation and interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar could also hold back the euro. The euro rises 0.3% to $1.0418, having earlier reached a one-week high of $1.0441, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0838 GMT - Gold futures rise, sitting close to all-time highs on safe-haven demand. Futures are up 0.4% at $2,938.90 a troy ounce, nearing the record $2,968.50 an ounce set on Tuesday's session. Gold's gains come despite rising U.S. yields, traditionally a headwind to the precious metal's price, Swissquote Bank's Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. This usually negative relationship has broken down as big buyers, including central banks, flee typically safe U.S. debt and replace it with gold, Ozkardeskaya writes. Spot gold prices hitting the $3,000 an ounce level could trigger some profit taking and a tactical opportunity to short the yellow metal, but the medium to long-term outlook for gold remains positive, Ozkardeskaya says. "If Bitcoin could rally to $100,000, gold could well continue its journey toward... $4,000 per ounce," she adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

0835 GMT - Yields on U.K. government bonds, or gilts, fall slightly after U.K. GDP data showed modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the three months to September. U.K. monthly real GDP grew 0.4% in December, stronger than the consensus forecast of 0.1% by economists in a WSJ poll. The GDP data was slightly above forecasts but it remains weak, raising concerns about the U.K. economy, MoneyFarm's Richard Flax says in a note. "As policymakers and businesses digest these GDP figures, they are likely to remain focused on the challenge of generating stronger economic growth against backdrop of uncertainty around tariffs," he says. The 10-year gilt yield declines 2 basis points to 4.534%, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)

0832 GMT - The U.K.'s recovery now banks on policy, trade, and a recovery in consumer spending, Deutsche Bank economist Sanjay Raja writes in a note to clients. An expansion of 0.1% in GDP in the fourth quarter of last year leaves the British economy on a more positive footing, Raja says. But vulnerabilities remain, he says, pointing to a looming trade war and rising energy bills. "The near-term U.K. recovery now rests on three pillars: less restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, a savings-led household consumption recovery, and a rebalancing in trade," Raja says.

0826 GMT - The 0.1% growth in the U.K. economy in the fourth quarter leaves the economy all but stagnating, Capital Economics' Paul Dales says. A lot of the weakness is due to the rise in business taxes announced in October's government budget as well as soft demand overseas. With business sentiment on the floor and employment declining, it's hard to see private-sector activity improving much in the first or second quarter, Dales says. Business investment fell for the first time in five quarters, with the only areas of growth being government consumption, government investment and inventories. "The economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months," he says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)

0824 GMT - European defense stocks faced pressure in early-morning trade Thursday, following the call between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over a potential cease-fire in the Ukraine-Russia war. Germany's Rheinmetall, one of the biggest beneficiaries from the conflict, is down 2.1% at 713.20 euros, while the German sensor solutions provider Hensoldt falls 7.1% at 33.38 euros, and Renk Group losses 2.2% at 23.92 euros. In the U.K., BAE Systems is down 0.3% at 12.05 pounds, and Italy's Leonardo falls 2.2% at 29.26 euros. European foreign ministers issued a joint statement Wednesday saying that they want to put Ukraine in a position of strength, but without a budgetary announcement this is unlikely to prevent significant pressure on European defense stocks, Jefferies analysts Chloe Lemarie and Ben Brown say.

0824 GMT - Faster Bank of England rate cuts are still possible, despite the U.K. reporting stronger-than-expected economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year, Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, says in a note. The 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter shows the loss of confidence following the budget was more than offset by a bumper December, where strong services activity helped boost overall output, he says. However, the loss of business confidence following the budget adds to longstanding difficulties, including poor productivity. With BOE policymakers more worried about a stagnating economy than rising inflation, another rate cut sooner rather than later remains on the table, he says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)

0822 GMT - Sterling could hand back its gains if investors reassess Thursday's seemingly better-than-expected U.K. economic growth data, ING analysts say in a note. Growth was driven by a massive rise in inventories, which are volatile and don't tell much about underlying economic fundamentals, they say. Consumption was flat, business investment fell sharply and net trade was flat. "So it's a lacklustre story, which puts pressure on the U.K. Treasury to find savings." ING is negative on sterling for the second quarter and expects EUR/GBP to stay above the 0.8300-0.8350 this month. EUR/GBP falls 0.1% to 0.8340. GBP/USD rises 0.4% to 1.2493. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0819 GMT - The dollar falls as hopes for a deal to end the Ukraine-Russia conflict reduce demand for safe-haven assets, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. President Trump said he had a constructive call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday with the leaders agreeing to start negotiations for a peace deal. The dollar's decline comes even after U.S. inflation data Wednesday exceeded expectations. This encourages other currencies to recover losses against the dollar such as the euro, Ozkardeskaya says. The DXY dollar index falls 0.3% to 107.611, having earlier hit a one-week low of 107.502. The euro rises 0.4% to $1.0425 after reaching a one-week high of $1.0441 earlier, according to FactSet.

0806 GMT - Data showing small, but better-than-expected, U.K. growth in the fourth quarter gift Treasury chief Rachel Reeves a slither of good news and relieves some stress on the government, says Wealth Club's Isaac Stell in a note. The government is under pressure to execute on their manifesto promise to deliver growth, says Stell, who is investment manager at the broker. "With Reeves committed to her non-negotiable fiscal rules, it is likely that public expenditure will be cut to balance the books with the prospect of additional tax hikes looming in the background." The impact of any additional taxes will likely hamper growth going forward, he says. U.K. GDP rose 0.1% between October and December. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
