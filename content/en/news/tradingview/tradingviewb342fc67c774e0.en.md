**Financial Highlights**

**Net Income:** Net income for the year was $1,109.1 million, a decrease of 3.4% primarily due to the absence of a one-time gain recognized in the prior year.

**Adjusted EBITDA:** Adjusted EBITDA increased by 12.7% to $1,716.5 million, driven by the growth in operating revenues compared to Adjusted EBITDA expenses.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments:** MSCI operates through three main reportable segments: Index, Analytics, and ESG and Climate. The Index segment includes revenues from recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees, and non-recurring revenues. The Analytics segment offers risk management and performance attribution tools, while the ESG and Climate segment provides data and tools for sustainability and climate risk assessment.

**Sales Units:** The company reported a 5.8% growth in the number of employees, with a total of 6,132 employees as of December 31, 2024. This growth supports the company's operational expansion and increased demand for its products and services.

**New Product Launches:** MSCI is focused on developing advanced technology and innovative solutions, including the use of AI to enhance products and services. Recent acquisitions, such as Fabric and Foxberry, have strengthened the company's capabilities in wealth management and index customization.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Operational and Market Risks:** MSCI operates in a complex and evolving investment landscape, which presents challenges such as fee compression, changing demographics, and regulatory shifts. The integration of sustainability and climate considerations into investment processes is becoming increasingly important, and the company must adapt to these trends to remain competitive.

**Cybersecurity and Regulatory Risks:** The company faces numerous risks, including operational risks related to its dependence on third-party suppliers for data and services, which could impact its ability to deliver products. Cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks and data breaches, pose significant risks to the company's operations and reputation. Regulatory risks are heightened by evolving laws affecting benchmarks and ESG ratings, which could impose compliance burdens and impact product offerings. The use of AI introduces risks related to potential biases, inaccuracies, and regulatory scrutiny.

**Market Risks:** MSCI is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could impact its financial results. It manages this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, although these may not fully mitigate the impact. Interest rate risks are also present due to variable rate indebtedness, which could increase debt service obligations if rates rise.

**Management Strategies:** Management acknowledges the challenges posed by increased competition and the need for innovation to maintain market position. The company is focused on leveraging advanced technologies, including AI, to enhance its products and services. Strategic initiatives include expanding global operations and developing new products to meet client demands. The company is also addressing regulatory compliance and cybersecurity measures to mitigate associated risks.
