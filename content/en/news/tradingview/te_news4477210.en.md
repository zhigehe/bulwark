The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce’s consumer confidence index climbed to 59.0 in January 2025, up from December’s 57.9.

This marked the fourth consecutive period of improvement and the highest figure since May, mainly supported by the government's economic measures and a surge in tourism arrivals.

Foreign tourist arrivals to Thailand soared 22% to 3.7 million in January, mainly boosted by higher arrivals from China during the Lunar New Year holidays.
