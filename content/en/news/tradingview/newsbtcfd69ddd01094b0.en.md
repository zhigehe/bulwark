The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally acknowledged a bid to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Solana. The bid was filed by Grayscale, a crypto asset management firm.

This is particularly noteworthy because it reflects a change of heart of the top regulatory body. After all, the SEC rejected a similar bid just six weeks ago.

However, that was before Donald Trump arrived in the White House. So, this is another clear signal that the new US government is very crypto-friendly. Combined with $SOL holding support and remaining stable, an ETF is indeed very bullish news for the blockchain, and by extension, its meme coins.

Here are 6 cryptos that could benefit from $SOL-based ETFs and yield handsome returns for you.

**1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin to Buy as Solana ETF Becomes a Reality**

As the launch of Solana ETFs draws closer, **Solaxy ($SOLX)** is set to be the biggest beneficiary of Solana’s upcoming bull run.

This is because Solaxy is the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network and, as such, is going to remove the biggest issues that have been plaguing Solana Layer 1 chains.

By combining the goodness of both Ethereum and Solana – **$SOLX** is a multi-chain token – Solaxy will increase Solana’s ability to scale and carry out orders simultaneously. This means no more failed transactions or slower throughputs on Solana. Also, transactions will be carried out faster and for lower costs than before. All things considered, it’s no wonder $SOLX is being touted as the next crypto to explode.

With close to $19M in presale funding so far, the $SOLX presale has proved the project’s hype and worth. You can join now for just $0.00163 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX.

**2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Crypto Coin Offering Investment Advice**

**MIND of Pepe ($MIND)** is a revolutionary AI agent coin that’s set to alter the fate of many small crypto traders like you and me.

It’s a self-evolving and autonomous AI-powered entity that lives on dApps and online platforms like X, chatting with crypto enthusiasts, influencers, and communities and understanding the ‘word on the street.’

Next, it uses next-gen hive-mind analysis to cut through all the clutter and come up with crypto investment opportunities that can actually yield profits. $MIND token holders will not only get exclusive access to such early-stage, high-potential trading calls, but they’ll also benefit from early access to the top new cryptos, i.e., even before they’re made available to the general public.

The **MIND of Pepe presale** has already garnered over $5.5M, and it’s currently offering 1 $MIND for $0.0032924. However, the price will increase in the next few hours, so interested investors should hurry up. Check out how to buy $MIND for more info.

**3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – A Less Risky Approach to Investing in Meme Coins**

If you’re on the ropes about investing directly into individual meme coins and would like something safer, **Meme Index ($MEMEX)** is exactly what you’re looking for.

This one-of-a-kind crypto offers four different baskets of meme coins, providing investors with the diversity to curate an investment strategy that’s perfectly aligned with their risk tolerance and psychology.

$MEMEX’s baskets range from very safe ones like the Meme Titan Index that contain only well-established cryptos with a market cap of over $1B all the way to risky but exponentially rewarding baskets like the Meme Frenzy Index, which is made up of the top trending cryptos that could skyrocket soon. With the memecoin market destined for long-term growth, Meme Index could very well be among the biggest gainers, seeing as it allows every single type of investor to become a participant.

The $MEMEX presale has over $3.4M in its kitty at the time of writing, and you can be a token holder for just $$0.0159713. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy $MEMEX.

**4. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Biggest Crypto Presale Set to Offer Massive Gains**

**Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)** is hands down the best crypto presale of all time. It has crossed the mighty Pepe Unchained by collecting a record amount of $70M+ within a relatively short period of time. The hype is real.

$WEPE aims to sweep the floor with crypto whales and level the playing field for small investors like you and me. This Robin Hood-like mission has been the project’s biggest selling point. As a $WEPE token holder, you’ll receive unique market insights (including insider info), investment calls and strategies, and access to a thriving community of traders who will share their secrets, mutually benefitting from each other and ultimately abolishing the dominance of institutional investors.

The **$WEPE presale** will end any moment now, so this is your last chance to join the frog army at a low price of just $0.0003665 per token. Here’s how to buy $WEPE.

**5. Bonk ($BONK) – OG Dog Meme Coin to Get a Boost with Solana ETF**

Bonk was the first-ever dog-themed meme coin to be launched on Solana, rivaling the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu right from day one.

It had a fantastic debut on Christmas Day 2022 when it airdropped a mind-boggling 50% of its total supply of 100 trillion coins to Solana community members who contributed to its creation.

This wasn’t just a marketing move, either. $BONK really aims to become the community coin of Solana and challenge the very existence of predatory VC tokens.

Although it was in red territory until very recently, $BONK looks like a really good buy right now.

It’s up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours, which could only be the beginning of a long rally upwards, as it stands to benefit massively from the launch of Solana ETFs.

**6. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – NFT-Meme Coin Combination on Solana**

Pudgy Penguins is another Solana-based meme coin, which is why it, too, reacted positively to the possibility of Solana ETFs becoming a reality. It’s up by around 3% today.

It’s worth noting that $PENGU first launched on Ethereum (back in 2021). However, it rose to fame only when it shifted to Solana last year, attracting new investors and building a vibrant community.

Pudgy Penguins is based on an NFT collection by the same name. It’s a cutesy assortment of 8,888 penguin-themed cartoon characters, meaning the token now derives its value from community support and cultural significance.

Moreover, a current price of just $0.03 also makes Pudgy Penguins one of the best cryptos under $1.

**Conclusion**

Although the above-mentioned meme coins are highly likely to shoot up because of the launch of a Solana ETF, that’s not to say you shouldn’t follow a healthy investment plan.

Always invest an amount you’re comfortable losing and do your own research before investing. Also, this article isn’t financial advice, and we merely offer our honest insights.
