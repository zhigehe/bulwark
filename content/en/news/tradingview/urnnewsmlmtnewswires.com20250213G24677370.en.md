King River Resources found high-grade gold mineralization at its Tennant Creek gold project in Australia, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

The assay results include 7 meters at 5.8 grams per tonne (g/t) grade of gold including 3 meters at 11.9 g/t gold with 1 meter at 26 g/t gold from a depth of 32 meters.

Exploration drilling testing for new structures around Kurundi Main has identified three new anomalously mineralized structures with grades of up to 0.2 g/t gold, 0.3% copper, and 26 parts per million silver, the filing added.
