Willas-Array Electronics (Holdings) said the Singapore Exchange (SGX) has granted an extension until March 31 to release its audited financial results for the nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, according to a Tuesday filing on the Singapore Exchange.

The company cited delays linked to a planned auditor change, which requires prior approval from Hong Kong's Accounting and Financial Reporting Council.

The approval is expected by late February, after which the incoming auditor must conduct additional procedures before finalizing the audit.

Willas-Array also attributed the delay to the recent shift in its financial year-end to Dec. 31 from March 31, aligning with its parent company, Shanghai YCT Electronics .

The transition, coupled with the Chinese New Year holiday and peak reporting season, has added pressure to its financial reporting process.
