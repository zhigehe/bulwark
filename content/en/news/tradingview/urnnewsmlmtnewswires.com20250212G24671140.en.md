New Zealand businesses expect inflation to rise over the near term and gradually ease in succeeding years as interest rates are on course to decline further, according to a survey by the Reserve Bank published Thursday.

Expectations for one-year-ahead annual inflation increased to 2.15% from 2.05%. Two-year ahead inflation expectations fell to 2.06% from 2.12%. Five-year-ahead and 10-year-ahead inflation expectations decreased to 2.13% and 2.07%, respectively, per the report.

Businesses expect the official cash rate to be lowered to 3.77% by the end of the March quarter from the current 4.25% before falling further to 3.23% by the end of the December quarter.

The one-year-ahead unemployment rate expectations fell to 5.08% from 5.22%, while the two-year counterpart declined to 4.69% from 4.86%.

The Reserve Bank received 42 responses from business leaders and professional forecasters during the survey period.
