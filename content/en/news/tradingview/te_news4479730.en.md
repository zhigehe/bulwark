The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note held steady around 4.54% on Friday as traders assessed President Trump's trade policies and key economic data.

On Thursday, Trump signed a directive instructing the US Trade Representative and Commerce Secretary to propose new country-specific tariffs, a process that could take weeks or months.

Investors await further details and remain hopeful that negotiations could avert the levies.

Meanwhile, both CPI and PPI exceeded forecasts, though the PPI components feeding into the PCE index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, showed signs of cooling.

The data has reinforced the Fedâ€™s cautious stance on rate cuts, with Chair Powell emphasizing before Congress that the central bank is in no hurry to ease policy.

Retail sales data due today will offer further insights into consumer spending trends.
