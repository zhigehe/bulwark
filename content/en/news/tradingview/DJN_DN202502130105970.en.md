Unilever's 2025 outlook is probably in line with consensus, but RBC Capital Markets wouldn't be surprised to see first and second quarter consensus coming down. The outlook emphasizes a slow start to 2025, with organic sales growth for the year within the 3%-5% mid-term range versus company compiled consensus at 4.3%. A modest EBIT margin improvement is also seen, with consensus looking for a 30 basis point increase. Analyst James Edwardes Jones says the results were solid, and there was a 1.5 billion euro share buyback thrown in, which is expected to be completed before the ice cream demerger in late 2025. RBC rates Unilever at underperform with a 40 pound price target. Shares fall 6.5% to 44.42 pounds. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
