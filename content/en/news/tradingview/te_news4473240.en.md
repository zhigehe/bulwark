The BSE Sensex closed about 0.7% lower at 77,311.8 on Monday, its lowest level in a week and extending losses for the fourth straight session, as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, as well as reciprocal tariffs on several countries.

Metals stocks were the hardest hit, along with energy companies and banks.

On the earnings front, the companies are facing downgrades in estimates due to a weak demand environment, margin pressure, and a cautious near-term outlook.

Continued foreign outflows also continued to weigh on the market.

On the political front, the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s (BJP) victory in the Delhi elections helped ease concerns about political stability at the Centre.
