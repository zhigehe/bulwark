COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ascendis Pharma A/S today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided a business update.

“Having achieved pivotal milestones in 2024, Ascendis is positioned to continue strong revenue growth in 2025 and beyond,” said Jan Mikkelsen, Ascendis Pharma’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe YORVIPATH is well on its way to establishing itself as the new global standard for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism in adults. SKYTROFA has achieved a leading position in value in the U.S. growth hormone market. And for TransCon CNP, we have a clear path to submit our NDA and MAA as a differentiated treatment of achondroplasia in children. Together with a strong cash balance and established partnerships, I am confident in our ability to become a leading global biopharmaceutical company with multiple blockbuster products and a strong engine for future innovation.”

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was €173.9 million, compared to €137.7 million during the same period for 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the upfront fee of $100 million from Novo Nordisk and the EU launch of YORVIPATH.

Total revenue for 2024 was €363.6 million compared to €266.7 million in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the upfront fee of $100 million from Novo Nordisk and greater commercial product revenue. Non-product revenue was €137.9 million in 2024, compared to €88.1 million in 2023.

Research and development (R&D) costs for the fourth quarter of 2024 were €79.3 million, compared to €90.9 million during the same period in 2023. The decline was largely due to lower external development costs for TransCon hGH and TransCon PTH, as well as the Eyconis spin-off. R&D costs for 2024 were €307.0 million compared to €413.5 million in 2023. The lower R&D costs in 2024 was driven primarily by a decrease in external program development costs as well as the Eyconis spin-off.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were €80.2 million, compared to €64.0 million during the same period in 2023. The increase was due to higher employee costs, including the impact from global commercial expansion, and higher external commercial costs. SG&A expenses for 2024 were €291.1 million compared to €264.4 million in 2023. Higher SG&A expenses were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and other general and administrative expenses attributable to organizational growth in support of launch of YORVIPATH in Europe and the U.S.

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were €159.5 million compared to €154.9 million during the same period in 2023. Total operating expenses for 2024 were €598.1 million compared to €677.9 million in 2023.

Net finance expenses were €33.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to €41.6 million in the same period in 2023. Net finance expenses for 2024 were €74.4 million compared to €0.2 million in 2023. The full year net finance expense increase was driven primarily by non-cash items.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Ascendis Pharma reported a net loss of €38.5 million, or €0.64 per share (basic and diluted) compared to a net loss of €86.9 million, or €1.54 per share (basic and diluted) for the same period in 2023. For the full year 2024, Ascendis Pharma reported a net loss of €378.1 million, or €6.53 per share (basic and diluted) compared to a net loss of €481.4 million, or €8.55 per share (basic and diluted) in 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, Ascendis Pharma had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling €559.5 million compared to €399.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the year end, we received the $100 million upfront payment from Novo Nordisk which was received in January 2025. As of December 31, 2024, Ascendis Pharma had 60,689,487 ordinary shares outstanding, including 845,887 ordinary shares represented by ADSs held by the company.
