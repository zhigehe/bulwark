Consumer companies rose as two major consumer-products companies posted growth ahead of Wall Street expectations.

Coca-Cola shares rose after the beverage maker reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. WK Kellogg shares rallied after the cereal maker's earnings topped the mean analyst target.

Marriott International shares slid after the hotelier said its fourth-quarter profit fell, despite strong international travel demand.

Kering's revenue fell by less than analysts expected in the fourth quarter as the Gucci owner seeks to reinvigorate a turnaround plan for its core brand. German travel agency TUI saw shares fall after it warned about slowdowns in booking and pricing growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
