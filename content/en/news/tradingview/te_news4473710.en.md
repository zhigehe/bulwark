Wheat futures declined to $5.79 per bushel on Monday, as concerns over potential retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural exports weighed on the market.

Traders shifted focus to the upcoming US Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, which is expected to show substantial wheat ending stocks, putting further pressure on prices.

Additionally, fears of freeze damage to key wheat-growing regions in the Black Sea and US Plains diminished as forecasts predicted snow cover, reducing the risk of winterkill.

Market uncertainty remains high due to trade policy concerns, which could impact wheat exports.

Meanwhile, global weather patterns, particularly in South America, continue to influence supply expectations.
