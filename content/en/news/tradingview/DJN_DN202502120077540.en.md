AnaptysBio shares surged 37% in premarket trading Wednesday after a mid-stage trial evaluating a rheumatoid arthritis treatment achieved its primary endpoint.

Shares were recently trading around $17. The stock is down about 44% over the last year.

AnaptysBio said the phase 2b study of rosnilimab in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis on background conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs met its main goal of lowering disease activity at week 12 in all three doses of the drug.

The clinical stage biotechnology company said rosnilimab achieved statistical significance in at least one dose and numerical superiority at all doses on key secondary endpoints at week 12, even though higher than typical placebo rates were observed.

AnaptysBio added that data across all doses showed immunological impact with robust on-target pharmacological activity in patients under treatment that was not observed for those on placebo.
