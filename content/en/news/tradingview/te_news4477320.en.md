The Nikkei 225 Index surged 1.28% to close at 39,461, while the broader Topix Index gained 1.18% to 2,766 on Thursday, marking a second consecutive session of gains amid a weakening yen.

A softer yen improves the profit outlook for Japan’s export-driven industries and makes Japanese assets more attractive to foreign investors.

Additionally, a strong corporate earnings season helped boost market sentiment.

Notable performances came from index heavyweights, including IHI Corp (+3.6%), Advantest (+3.1%), Mitsubishi UFJ (+1.9%), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (+2.9%), and Lasertec (+12%).

However, SoftBank Group saw a sharp decline, falling 3.6% after reporting a quarterly loss of $2.4 billion for the three months ending December, largely due to a slump in tech valuations at its Vision Fund.
