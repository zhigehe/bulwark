Prince Housing & Development won a lawsuit against its ex- president Ren-Qin Chen, who was ordered to compensate NT$84.2 million plus interest.

The case originated from the executive's breach of duty, causing company losses, according to a Thursday Taiwan Exchange filing.

The Taiwan High Court Tainan Branch upheld the ruling on Tuesday. Chen had initially appealed after a 2023 ruling. Both parties still have the right to appeal, the filing said.
