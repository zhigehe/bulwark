The S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2% to around 8,500 on Tuesday, recovering some of the losses from the previous session and tracking gains seen on Wall Street overnight, where technology stocks and steel producers led the way.

Investors also seemed to look past the latest tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, who enacted 25% levies on steel and aluminum imports.

In Australia, a private survey revealed that consumer confidence edged up slightly in February but remained in pessimistic territory, driven by concerns over strained household finances and persistent cost-of-living challenges.

Notable performers included index heavyweights such as Macquarie Group (up 1.7%), Northern Star Resources (up 3%), Zip Co (up 3.2%), Xero (up 1.1%), and Woodside Energy (up 0.9%).
