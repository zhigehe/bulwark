Key points:

* Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminium imports
* Egypt, Jordan bonds fall on Gaza uncertainty
* Hungary's inflation rises more than expected in January
* MSCI EM FX up 0.1%, stocks down 0.4%

Most emerging market currencies and stocks were lower on Tuesday, as the dollar added to its gains after U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariffs came into effect, stoking trade tensions.

Trump's latest tariff talks continued to fan worries of global trade tensions after he raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to a flat 25% and eliminated country exceptions, quota deals and product-specific exclusions.

South Africa's rand was 0.3% lower, while stocks in the natural resource-dependent country were off 0.4%, hit by tariffs. Steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa traded as much as 2% weaker.

Vietnam's dong hit a record low against the dollar, as the export-oriented country warned of tariff-linked impact on its economy.

Trump's announced plans for reciprocal tariffs in the next two days made investors cautious and they pulled away from certain EM assets.

"Traders have little clarity about how far tariff policies will go, whether they are mostly a negotiating tactic or if they will have a more long-lasting economic impact," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.

However, MSCI's index tracking global EM currencies (.MIEM00000CUS) was still up 0.1%, while the stocks gauge CBOE:EFS was off 0.4%.

"For now, risk assets seem comfortable with tariffs," said Brooks.

Meanwhile, Trump has proposed cancelling the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas if the latter did not release all hostages by midday on Saturday, and said he might withhold aid to Egypt and Jordan if they did not take Palestinian refugees relocated from Gaza.

Israel's shekel shed 0.2% against the dollar, while its stocks (.TA125) fell 0.9%.

Prices of Egypt's sovereign dollar bond (XS2079846635=TE) dipped nearly 1 cent. The Egyptian pound lost 0.3% versus the dollar, while the 3-month non-deliverable forwards contract rose to its highest since October, indicating traders expect the currency to weaken.

Jordan's dollar bonds dipped broadly across the board. King Abdullah is set to meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

In Europe, emerging currencies were all subdued against the euro . The Czech crown was 0.1% lower.

Data showed Hungarian inflation surged to an annual 5.5% in January, exceeding analyst forecasts.

Stocks in the region were broadly higher, with indexes in Poland and Hungary up 0.1% each.

Markets are also watching U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to policymakers for more clues on the central bank's interest rate path.

Meanwhile, the price of China Vanke's dollar bond (HK207864188=) rose to its highest since October, after state-owned Shenzhen Metro gave it a 2.8 billion yuan ($383.12 million) loan.

However, Moody's Ratings downgraded the company's rating to CAA1/CAA2 with a negative outlook despite the loan.
