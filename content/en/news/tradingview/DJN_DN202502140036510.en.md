NatWest's guidance for 2025 lack some punch, Hargreaves Lansdown says in a market comment after the British bank's results. The lender's expectations for this year align with consensus estimates. "The buzz around the sector and better-than-expected results in the final quarter mean investors will have been hoping to get a punchier outlook," analyst Matt Britzman writes, adding this might cause weakness in early exchanges. In the longer term, the decent set of results--which slightly beat expectations, closing a 2024 that saw a seismic positive sentiment shift--set up the bank for another good year. Shares open 1.4% lower at 431 pence, bringing its year to date gains to around 7%. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)
