The Federal Communications Commission has opened an investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal subsidiary to probe their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr said the commission's Enforcement Bureau wants to ensure the companies are not promoting "invidious forms of discrimination," as he wrote Tuesday in a letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. Carr noted Comcast's statement on its website that DEI is a core value of its business and that the company has DEI training for company leaders.

"Despite the emergence of DEI initiatives in recent years, these forms of discrimination have long been condemned by America's civil rights laws," Carr wrote in the letter.

Carr said the FCC is planning to shut down DEI programs at every company it regulates. It is starting with Comcast and NBCUniversal because the companies cover a wide range of industries regulated by the FCC, including media and internet, he said.
