South32 said its Worsley Alumina unit has received federal environmental approval for the Worsley mine development project under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, according to a Wednesday filing with the Australian bourse.

The approval aligns with the state permit granted in December 2024 and allows access to nearby bauxite reserves to help sustain operations, the filing said.

Mining is set to begin in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, with production expected to continue through the fiscal year 2036, the filing added.
