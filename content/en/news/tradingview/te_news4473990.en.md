The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.4% to around 3,310, while the Shenzhen Component fell 1% to 10,525 on Tuesday, as mainland stocks reversed a three-day rally.

Investors weighed the potential impact of the latest tariffs imposed by the US. President Donald Trump enacted 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions or exemptions, indirectly affecting China.

The pullback also followed profit-taking after a strong rally fueled by growing optimism about breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in China, particularly with companies adopting DeepSeekâ€™s open-source model into their operations.

Notable losses were seen among major companies, including BYD Company (-0.8%), East Money Information (-2.2%), iSoftStone (-6.1%), Dawning Information (-2.2%), and Jiangsu Hoperun (-3.1%).
