The trade deficit in Cyprus widened significantly to EUR 955.2 million in December 2024 from EUR 538.5 million in the corresponding month of the previous year, preliminary estimates showed.

Exports declined by 8.5% year-on-year to EUR 359 million, primarily attributed to lower sales to both EU member states (-5.3%) and third countries (-9.5%).

Meanwhile, imports surged by 37.8% from a year earlier to EUR 1,314.3 million, mainly due to higher purchases from EU member states (11.4%) and third countries (81.5%).

Considering the whole period of 2024, the country's trade deficit narrowed to EUR 8,134.3 million from EUR 8,470.4 million in the same period a year earlier.
