The Japanese yen traded around 153 per dollar on Friday after surging about 1% in the previous session, underpinned by a sharp retreat in the dollar as US President Donald Trump refrained from enacting reciprocal tariffs immediately, easing concerns about escalating global trade tensions.

Components of the latest US PPI report also indicated that the Fed-preferred core PCE inflation, due later this month, could come in lower than expected.

Meanwhile, Japan’s Economy Minister, Ryosei Akazawa, stated on Friday that Japan would respond appropriately to any US reciprocal tariffs.

A hawkish stance on the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy also continued to support the yen.

While there is uncertainty regarding whether the BOJ will raise interest rates again in March, the central bank is widely expected to implement further rate hikes later this year.
