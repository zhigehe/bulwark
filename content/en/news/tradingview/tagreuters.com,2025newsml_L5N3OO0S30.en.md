Turkey's currency is clearly broken, with the lira falling regardless of monetary policy or investor sentiment.

While few were surprised that the lira suffered during a period of highly unusual monetary policy, it is more surprising that it has continued to fall since more conventional policy has been applied.

Turkey's currency continued to drop when the nation's interest rate reached a stratospheric 50%, and is extending the slide now rates are being slashed.

The favourable opinion of ratings agencies has made not a jot of difference, and unless well hedged, those investing in Turkish assets will be suffering.

Anyone holding the lira is hurting with the currency carving out record lows on an almost daily basis, with little relief in sight even if the dollar slides in wider markets.

The lira is crashing versus the euro, which is the currency of Turkey's biggest export market, and the pound.

This week EUR/TRY reached 37.67, its highest point since early November, and is perilously close to the 38.43 all-time high reached last August. The lira has traded 45.20 versus Britain's pound, within touching distance of last September's record peak of 45.88.

Since March 2024, while the interest rate has been amazingly high, USD/TRY has risen almost 14%, reaching 36.11 this month. The pace of the rally has accelerated since [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/) won the U.S. election.

USD/TRY was trading around 30 when interest rates approached their peak in January 2024 and could reach 40 before this year ends.
