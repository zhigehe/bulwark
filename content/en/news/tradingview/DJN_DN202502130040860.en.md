Faster Bank of England rate cuts are still possible, despite the U.K. reporting stronger-than-expected economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year, Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, says in a note. The 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter shows the loss of confidence following the budget was more than offset by a bumper December, where strong services activity helped boost overall output, he says. However, the loss of business confidence following the budget adds to longstanding difficulties, including poor productivity. With BOE policymakers more worried about a stagnating economy than rising inflation, another rate cut sooner rather than later remains on the table, he says. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)
