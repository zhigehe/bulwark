Gold traded at a record high early on Thursday as the dollar and treasury yields weakened even as another U.S. inflation measure rose above expectations, firming expectations the Federal Reserve will slow interest-rate cuts this year.

Gold for April delivery was last seen up US$10.70 to US$2,239.70 per ounce, topping Monday's prior record high of US$2,934.40.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the January Producer Price Index (PPI), a wholesale price measure, rose at a 3.5% annualized pace in January, unchanged from December but above the FactSet consensus estimate for a 3.2% rise. Excluding volatile food and energy, core PPI rose 3.6%, slower than the prior month's 3.7% rise but above the 3.3% consensus estimate.

The rise follows on Wednesday's release of the U.S. January Consumer Price Index, which showed retail prices rose at 3.0% annual pace, also topping expectations and remaining well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Along with rising inflation, markets are being roiled by the prospect for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he held a call with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and followed with a call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to tell him he and Putin plan to meet to hold talks on ending the war without participation from Ukraine or Europe.

The dollar weakened following the inflation report, with the ICE dollar index last seen down 0.13 points to 107.81.

Treasury yields were also lower, cutting the carrying cost of owning gold. The U.S. two-year note was last seen paying 4.324%, down 3.3 basis points, while the yield on the 10-year note was down 7.2 points to 4.56%.
