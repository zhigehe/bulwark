This press release is not a prospectus within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation and has not been approved by any regulatory authority in any jurisdiction.

Any investment decision should, in order for an investor to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with the decision to participate in the Rights Issue, be made solely on the basis of the information contained in the prospectus.

The Company considers that it conducts protection-worthy activities under the Screening of Foreign Direct Investments Act (Sw. lag (2023:560) om granskning av utländska direktinvesteringar) (the "**FDI Act**").

Each investor should consult with an independent legal advisor as to the possible application of the FDI Act in relation to the Rights Issue for the individual investor.
