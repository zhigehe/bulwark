Slovakia’s construction output advanced by 4.3% year-on-year in December 2024, accelerating from a 0.9% increase in the previous month.

This marked the second consecutive month of growth in construction activity, driven by rebound in domestic production (4.4% vs -0.7% in November), fueled by increases seen in new construction (12.2% vs -2.3%), buildings (7.7% vs 7.6%), and smaller declines in engineering construction (-2.4% vs -11%).

Conversely, construction abroad significantly slowed (2.9% vs 18.7%).

On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, construction output was 1.2% higher.
