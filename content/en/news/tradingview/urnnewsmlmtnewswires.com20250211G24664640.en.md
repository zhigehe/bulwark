Vinyl Group has rebranded its media division to VinylMedia, a publishing house aimed at transforming brands into cultural icons, according to a Wednesday filing with the Australian bourse.

The move follows VinylGroup's acquisition of The Brag Media, which includes Rolling Stone Australia and Variety Australia, along with Mediaweek and the upcoming purchase of Concrete Playground, the filing said.

VinylMedia has also secured a licensing deal to relaunch Refinery29 in the ANZ region, marking its entry into the women's lifestyle space, the filing added.

Additionally, VinylMedia renewed its partnership with Penske Media (PMC) to continue publishing Rolling Stone Australia and Variety Australia and managing ad placements for key PMC titles, including Billboard and Deadline, the company said.

The newly formed division will leverage acquisitions such as Funkified and provide advertisers access to iconic brands like Rotten Tomatoes, Bluesfest Byron Bay, and Crunchyroll, per the filing.

Company shares fell 5% in recent trade.
