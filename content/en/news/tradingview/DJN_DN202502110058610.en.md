Dentsply Sirona initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for its Wellspect Healthcare business.

Wellspect, a provider of bladder and bowel management care products, has an estimated $2 billion total addressable market, said Dentsply.

"We look forward to determining an outcome for Wellspect that supports the business' enhanced growth trajectory and success while also enabling Dentsply Sirona to focus our resources and attention on our dental business," said Chief Executive Simon Campion.

The manufacturer and producer of dental products and technologies said there's no deadline or definitive timetable to complete the strategic alternatives process, or guarantee it will result in a transaction.
