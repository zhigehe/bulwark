Australia’s 10-year government bond yield fell to around 4.54% as expectations of an RBA rate cut remained intact despite a rise in consumer inflation expectations.

Consumer inflation expectations climbed to 4.6% in February from 4.0% in January, marking its highest level since April last year.

This comes ahead of the RBA’’s first monetary policy meeting of the year, set for next week.

Market odds now indicate a 95% probability of a cut to 4.10%, as recent data suggests underlying inflation is cooling faster than the central bank had anticipated.

In the US, hot inflation data reinforced expectations of prolonged Federal Reserve rate holds.

This came in line with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent remarks that the central bank is in no hurry to cut rates further, citing a sturdy economy and persistently high inflation.
