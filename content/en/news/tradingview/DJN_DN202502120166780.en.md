MGM Resorts International ended 2024 with a 6% decline in fourth-quarter revenue at its Las Vegas operations, CFO Jonathan Halkyard says on a call with analysts, citing tough comparatives. "This momentum gives us optimism that MGM's Las Vegas operations can grow in 2025, with the exception of the challenging comparisons this month of February," Halkyard says. The hotel and casino operator expects Las Vegas to be a source of stability and growth in the near term, CEO Bill Hornbuckle says. "We are investing in our business and the customer experience," he adds. Shares rise 11% to $38.09 in post-market trading. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
