CHICAGO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Century Aluminum Company strongly supports President Donald Trump’s decisive action today to strengthen Section 232 tariffs and fight back against unfair trade practices that have for years disadvantaged the U.S. primary aluminum industry.

Today’s executive order implements a 25% tariff on all primary aluminum imports into the U.S. from all foreign countries and closes a loophole in the existing tariff that allowed nearly 75% of imports to avoid the tariff. Closing these loopholes will protect good American jobs and our national security.

Century Aluminum CEO Jesse Gary applauded the President’s decisive action:

“We strongly support today’s Executive Order from President Donald J. Trump imposing a 25% tariff to stop the flood of aluminum imports into the United States. President Trump’s decisive action will protect national security and help level the playing field for America’s aluminum workers.

“On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs, which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production.”

Century Aluminum is the largest domestic producer of primary aluminum in the United States.
