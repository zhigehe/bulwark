UBS analysts are optimistic that Walmart's 4Q results, expected next week, will live up to investors' high expectations. The analysts forecast a better-than-expected holiday season, as well as a current-year outlook largely in-line with Wall Street views, setting the retailer up for continued raises during the year, according to a research note. They also expect higher marketing spend this year, which "would be a prudent way to press its advantages and draw in more customers." The analysts say Walmart's stock can continue to climb, citing the company's relative consistency amid volatile retail trends, as well as current investment trends. Walmart is up 14% year-to-date and up 82% in the past 12 months.(connor.hart@wsj.com)
