Nokia's appointment of Intel's head of data-center and artificial-intelligence as its new CEO reflects the company's shift in strategic focus, Inderes analyst Atte Riikola writes. Riikola says Nokia is increasingly focusing on network infrastructure, where data centers and AI investments are creating new growth opportunities. "We see this as a justified direction, as Nokia's longer-term growth prospects for mobile networks clearly look more modest than for network infrastructure." The analyst says the appointment of Justin Hotard once again raises the question of whether there could be structural changes in the core mobile networks business. "On paper, this would be an interesting option, but in practice it would be very challenging to implement." Shares trade 2.2% higher at 4.76 euros. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
