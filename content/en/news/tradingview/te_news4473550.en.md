Vehicle production in Brazil, including passenger cars, light utility vehicles, trucks and buses, fell by 7.7% over a month to 175,541 units in January 2025, according to Anfavea, the association that represents the automakers.

However, exports surged by 52.3% compared to January 2024, marking the best production result for the month since January 2021.

This growth reflected elevated domestic sales combined with increased exports, which encouraged companies to maintain high production levels and contributed to a rise in employment.

Domestic vehicle registrations surged 6% compared to the same period last year, while total sales of new and used vehicles hit a record 14.4 million units.

Imports also rose, driven by a significant influx of electrified vehicles, whose participation reached 10%, raising concerns about Brazilâ€™s trade balance.
