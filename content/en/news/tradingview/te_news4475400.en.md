Shares in Hong Kong soared 394 points or 1.8% to 21,685 in early trade on Wednesday, swinging from a 1.0% fall in the prior session amid solid gains across sectors.

The Hang Seng touched its highest level in four months following a pledge from China's cabinet to spur spending and lure foreign investment ahead of an annual legislative gathering in March.
