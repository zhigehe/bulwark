While JB Hi-Fi's 1H earnings were very strong, Jefferies expects a weaker gross profit margin to dominate the conversation. JB Hi-Fi beat EBIT expectations for every division in 1H and its January sales stayed robust. Still, JB Hi-Fi's gross margin of 22.12% was 19 basis points lower than a year earlier at the group level, with margins in its JB Hi-Fi Australia business falling below pre-Covid levels for the first time. Analyst Michael Simotas also notes JB Hi-Fi's cautious outlook given uncertainty in the retail market and ongoing competition, but says management is typically conservative. JB Hi-Fi is up 0.3%.
