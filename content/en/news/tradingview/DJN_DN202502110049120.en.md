USA Compression Partners shares rose 9.4% in premarket trading following higher results in its fourth quarter.

Shares were trading at around $32. The stock is up 27% over the last year.

The independent provider of natural gas compression services had fourth-quarter net income of $25.4 million on revenue of $245.9 million. This compares to net income of $12.8 million on revenue of $225 million a year earlier.

"We believe the macro backdrop continues to be favorable in the near- and medium-term," said Chief Executive Clint Green. He added that the company believes its assets in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will benefit in part from the electrification of everything as artificial intelligence and data center demand continues.
