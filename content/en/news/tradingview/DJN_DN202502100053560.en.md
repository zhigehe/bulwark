Investors are rushing to lock in attractive yields on euro-denominated corporate bonds as they expect yields on sovereign bonds to decline as the European Central Bank continues to cut interest rates, asset management company Edmond de Rothschild says in a note. "The outlook for lower yields to come is driving current demand as euro investment-grade is yielding an attractive 3.2% and euro high-yield 5.6%," they say. The ECB could cut the deposit rate to below 2.0% by the end of the summer from 2.75% currently, Edmond de Rothschild says. It would be advisable to buy long-dated euro corporate bonds, the asset manager says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
