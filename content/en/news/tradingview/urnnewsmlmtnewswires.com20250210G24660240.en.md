Salesforce said Monday a plan to invest $500 million in Saudi Arabia to drive the innovation and growth of artificial intelligence in the kingdom.

The allocation is part of the US cloud-based software company's expansion plans in Saudi Arabia, which also included the launch in January of a new regional headquarters in Riyadh.

Aside from the expansion of its digital labor platform Agentforce, Salesforce also intends to bring its platform architecture Hyperforce to the Kingdom as part of its growth strategy.
