The National Federation of Independent Business' monthly sentiment index fell to 102.8 in January from 105.1 in December, with declines in seven of the 10 components, particularly capital outlay plans.

"Overall, small business owners remain optimistic regarding future business conditions, but uncertainty is on the rise," said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. "Hiring challenges continue to frustrate Main Street owners as they struggle to find qualified workers to fill their many open positions. Meanwhile, fewer plan capital investments as they prepare for the months ahead."

Redbook reported that US same-store retail sales were up 5.3% year-over-year in the week ended Feb. 8, slower than a 5.7% gain in the prior week. Sales of Super Bowl items were the key driver and retailers expected a boost from Valentine's Day and President's Day in the current week.
