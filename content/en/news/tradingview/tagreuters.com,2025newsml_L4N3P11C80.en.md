\*\* Shares of sunscreen maker Edgewell Personal Care down as much as 15.7% to a more than four-year low of $26.65

\*\* Co reports Q1 sales decline of 2.1% to $478.4 million, below estimates of $480.1 million - data compiled by LSEG

\*\* Says sales were impacted by lower volumes and lower prices, along with unfavorable currency impacts

\*\* Q1 adjusted EPS of 7 cents also misses estimates of 12 cents, on higher promotion levels and currency impact

\*\* Co also sees annual adjusted EPS at lower end of previous forecast of $3.15 to $3.35 on anticipated negative foreign currency changes; maintains annual sales forecast

\*\* Co says forecast does not reflect potential impact from U.S. retaliatory tariffs

\*\* Brokerage Truist Securities says it's "one step forward, one step back", as progress from productivity initiatives, international growth is overshadowed by FX headwinds, North America declines

\*\* EPC fell 8.3% in 2024
