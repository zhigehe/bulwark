Outokumpu decided not to proceed with its planned investment to expand its US cold rolling capacity "at this point of time" following an extensive feasibility study.

The Finnish stainless steel manufacturer said Thursday it is on course to achieve its target of an 80-kiloton increase in cold rolling capacity in the Americas business area through focused de-bottlenecking investments and productivity gains after reaching an increase of 65 kilotons at 2024-end.

In addition, Outokumpu warned that the latest 25% tariffs on steel and certain steel derivatives imported into the US could have a material effect on the analysis it conducted before the announcements.
