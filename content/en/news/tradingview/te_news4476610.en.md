The CAC 40 reversed early losses to close 0.2% higher at 8,042 on Wednesday, marking its third consecutive session of gains and reaching its highest level since May 2024.

The index was lifted by strength in the luxury sector and a solid performance from financial institutions, even as investors scaled back expectations for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts following hotter-than-expected inflation data.

LVMH and Hermès rebounded after an initial dip driven by concerns over prolonged high borrowing costs in the U.S., supported by a 7% surge in Kering’s shares after the company posted better-than-expected 2024 results, showed improving trends in key markets, and fueled investor optimism over a potential turnaround for its flagship brand Gucci.

Meanwhile, the financial sector extended its momentum, with BNP Paribas and Société Générale gaining 1.2% and 2.2%, respectively.
