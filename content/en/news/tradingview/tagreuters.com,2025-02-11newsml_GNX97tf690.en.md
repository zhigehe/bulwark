CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — United Fire Group, Inc. (“UFG”) today reported financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2024, with a consolidated net income of $31.4 million ($1.21 income per diluted share) and consolidated adjusted operating income of $1.25 per diluted share.

“Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the continued progress we are making in the execution of our strategic business plan,” said UFG President and CEO Kevin Leidwinger. “The actions we have taken over the past two years to deepen our underwriting expertise, evolve our capabilities, better align with our distribution partners and improve our investment returns are materializing in our results.

“In 2024, we achieved the highest level of net written premiums in our company’s 79-year history. In addition, we produced the best annual combined ratio and highest adjusted operating income since 2015. These milestones reflect key steps on our journey to consistently deliver superior financial and operational performance.

“In the fourth quarter, net written premiums grew 13% led by our core commercial and assumed reinsurance business. Core commercial growth was driven by average renewal increases of 11.9%, a substantial increase in new business production and stable retention. On a full year basis, net written premiums grew 15% to $1.2 billion.

“The fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 94.4%, the lowest in 11 quarters, while the full year combined ratio improved 10.1 points to 99.2%. The underlying loss ratio improved to 55.7% for the quarter and 57.9% for the year, reflecting the ongoing benefits of strong earned rate achievement exceeding loss trends and continued underwriting discipline resulting in improved frequency outcomes. Prior year reserve development remained neutral overall in the quarter while the impact from catastrophes was well below historical averages at 1.6% for the quarter and 5.4% for the year.

“The fourth quarter and full year expense ratios were elevated due to investments in talent to deepen expertise across the company, accelerated development of our new policy administration system that is now poised for implementation in 2025, and increased performance-based compensation for employees and agents due to current year achievements.

“Net investment income improved to $23.2 million in the fourth quarter and $82.0 million for the full year. Fixed maturity income increased to $70 million for the year as new money yields remained strong. We also benefited from improved valuations on our limited partnership portfolio for the full year. We expect the fixed maturity portfolio to generate over $80 million of annualized fixed maturity income, with potential for further improvement from future reinvestment at higher rates.

“Reported book value per share decreased slightly in the fourth quarter due to a change in after-tax unrealized loss caused by increased interest rates. Our improved annual earnings and return on equity of 8.2% allowed adjusted book value per share to grow $1.95 for the year to $33.64.

“During the fourth quarter, we successfully resolved the rating errors in our core commercial business that were identified in the second quarter, resulting in no financial impact to the company. As a result, we have reversed the $3.2 million contingent liability established in the second quarter.

“While 2024 marked a return to underwriting profitability for UFG, our work is far from finished. We remain confident in our ability to execute the business plan for improved performance in the years ahead and are grateful for our people and their dedication to delivering the deep expertise, specialized capabilities, personal relationships and responsive service that our partners and policyholders value.

“Finally, our hearts go out to all those impacted by the devastating wildfires in Southern California. Our claims and risk control professionals continue to assist policyholders in the wake of the destruction. At this time, we estimate losses in the range of $7 million to $10 million from this tragic event.”

**Total Property & Casualty Underwriting Results**

**Fourth quarter 2024 results:**

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2023, unless noted otherwise)

Net written premiums and net earned premiums increased by 13% and 17%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2024, led by core commercial and assumed reinsurance business. Commercial lines net written premiums excluding surety and specialty increased 13%, supported by increased pricing with an overall increase in average renewal premiums of 11.9%. Rate increases accounted for 10.8% while exposure increases contributed an additional 1.0%. Excluding the workers’ compensation line of business, the overall average increase in renewal premiums was 12.9%, with 11.7% from rate increases and 1.1% from exposure changes.

The combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 94.4%, improving 4.8 points from 99.2% driven by improvement in the underlying loss ratio. Prior year reserve development, excluding catastrophe losses, was neutral for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 3.3% of unfavorable development in the fourth quarter of 2023. Catastrophe losses added 1.6 points to the combined ratio, an increase of 0.1 points and below both the five-year and 10-year historical averages. The underlying loss ratio of 55.7% improved 4.3 points, reflecting improvement from a combination of rate achievement, continued favorable claim frequency, and lower large loss activity, most notably in the surety portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the umbrella loss ratio, reflecting continued uncertainty from the impact of social inflation. The underwriting expense ratio of 37.1% increased 2.7 points driven by increased performance-based compensation for employees and agents due to current year achievements.

**Full year 2024 results:**

(All comparisons vs. full year 2023, unless noted otherwise)

Net written premiums and net earned premiums increased by 15% and 14%, respectively, led by core commercial, assumed reinsurance and surety. Commercial lines net written premiums excluding surety and specialty increased 13%, supported by increased pricing with an overall increase in average renewal premiums of 11.8%. Rate increases accounted for 10.1% while exposure increases contributed an additional 1.6%. Excluding the workers’ compensation line of business, the overall average increase in renewal premiums was 12.9%, with 11.2% from rate increases and 1.6% from exposure changes.

For the full year, the combined ratio was 99.2%, improving 10.1 points from 109.3% driven by improvement in all components of the loss ratio. Prior year reserve development, excluding catastrophe losses, was neutral for the full year 2024 compared to 6.0% of unfavorable development in the full year 2023. Catastrophe losses added 5.4 points to the combined ratio, an improvement of 0.8 points and below both the five-year and 10-year historical averages. The underlying loss ratio of 57.9% improved 4.3 points, reflecting improvement from a combination of underwriting actions, increased pricing, expense management, lower frequency trends and lower large loss activity in the property and surety lines of business, partially offset by an increase in the umbrella loss ratio. The underwriting expense ratio of 35.9% increased 1.0 point primarily due to investments in talent to deepen expertise across the company; accelerated development of our new policy administration system that is now poised for implementation in 2025; and increased performance-based compensation for employees and agents due to current year achievements.

**Investment Results**

**Fourth quarter 2024 results:**

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2023, unless noted otherwise)

Net investment income was $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $4.1 million or 21.2%. Income from the fixed maturity portfolio increased by $4.8 million due to portfolio management actions and investing at higher interest rates. Other investment income increased by $1.2 million driven by $1.1 million of interest on cash and cash equivalents. Income on other long-term investments decreased $1.3 million driven by better returns in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dividends on equity securities decreased $0.5 million due to the strategic re-allocation into fixed maturities.

**Full year 2024 results:**

(All comparisons vs. full year 2023, unless noted otherwise)

Net investment income was $82.0 million for the full year 2024, an increase of $22.4 million or 37.5%. Interest on fixed maturities was up $13.5 million or 23.9% as a result of portfolio management actions, investing at higher rates, and the strategic re-allocation of equity securities into fixed maturities, which resulted in a decrease in dividend income of $3.2 million. Income on other long-term investments was $8.0 million in 2024 compared to the depressed income of zero for 2023, as the valuation of the investments in limited liability partnerships varies from period to period due to the current market conditions. Other investment income increased $5.6 million, driven by $4.8 million of interest on cash and cash equivalents.

The company’s book value per share was $30.80, an increase of $1.76 per share, or 6.1%, from December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily related to an increase in net income, partially offset with an increase in net unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities and shareholder dividends during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2024.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, the company declared and paid a $0.16 per share cash dividend to shareholders of record as of November 29, 2024. UFG has paid a quarterly dividend every quarter since March 1968.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations to Comparable GAAP Measures

The company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations and profitability. Management also believes that disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances investor understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report include: adjusted operating income, underlying loss ratio, underlying combined ratio, and adjusted book value per share. The company has provided the following definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures:

**Adjusted operating income:** Adjusted operating income is calculated by excluding net investment gains and losses, after applicable federal and state income taxes from net income (loss). Management believes adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company performance and a useful supplement to GAAP information because it better represents the normal, ongoing performance of our business. Investors and equity analysts who invest in and report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses.

Underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio: Underlying loss ratio represents the net loss ratio less the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio less the impacts of catastrophes and non-catastrophe prior year reserve development. The company believes that the underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio are meaningful measures to understand the underlying trends in the core business in the current accident year, removing the volatility of prior year impacts and catastrophes. Management believes separate discussions on catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development are important to understanding how the company is managing catastrophe risk and in identifying developments in longer-tailed business.

Prior year reserve development is the increase (unfavorable) or decrease (favorable) in incurred loss and loss adjustment expense at the valuation dates for losses which occurred in previous calendar years. This measure excludes development on catastrophe losses.

Catastrophe losses is an operational measure which utilizes the designations of the Insurance Services Office (“ISO”) and is reported with losses and loss adjustment expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables, unless specified otherwise. In addition to ISO catastrophes, we also include as catastrophes those events, which may include U.S. or international losses, that we believe are, or will be, material to our operations, either in amount or in number of claims made. Catastrophes are not predictable and are unique in terms of timing and financial impact. While management estimates catastrophe losses as incurred, due to the inherently unique nature of catastrophe losses, the impact in a reporting period is inclusive of catastrophes that occurred in the reporting period, as well as development on catastrophes that have occurred in prior periods.

**Adjusted book value per share:** Adjusted book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, by the number of common shares outstanding. Management believes adjusted book value per share is a meaningful measure for evaluating the company's net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations, because it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets that can fluctuate from period to period. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

**Certain Performance Measures**

The company uses the following measure to evaluate its financial performance. Management believes a discussion of this measure provides financial statement users with a better understanding of the company’s results of operations. The company has provided the following definition:

**Net written premiums:** Net written premiums is frequently used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies. Net written premiums is the amount charged for insurance policy contracts issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management believes net written premiums is a meaningful measure for evaluating insurance company sales performance and geographical expansion efforts. Net written premiums for an insurance company consists of direct premiums written and premiums assumed, less premiums ceded. Net earned premiums is calculated on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the respective policies. Unearned premium reserves are established for the portion of written premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of the insurance policies in force. The difference between net earned premiums and net written premiums is the change in unearned premiums and the change in prepaid reinsurance premiums.
