Deere & Co.'s stock fell 6% early Thursday, after the maker of agricultural equipment 's fiscal first-quarter earnings fell sharply from a year ago and it guided for further steep sales decline in 2025/

Moline, Ill.-based Deere (DE) had per-share earnings of $3.19 for the quarter through Jan. 26, down from $6.23 a share a year ago. Sales fell 30% to $8.508 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $3.11 and sales of $7.700 billion.

"Deere's performance in the first quarter highlights our continued focus on optimizing inventory levels of both new and used equipment amidst the uncertain market conditions our customers are facing," CEO John C. May said in prepared remarks.

The company is now expecting sales at its production and precision agriculture division to fell 15% to 20% in fiscal 2025. It expects small ag & turf sales to fall 10% and for construction and forestry sales to fell 10% to 15%. The guidance does not include any impact from tariffs by the U.S. or retaliatory actions by other countries.
