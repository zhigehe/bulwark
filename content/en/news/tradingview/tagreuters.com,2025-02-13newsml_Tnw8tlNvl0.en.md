(TheNewswire)

February 13th 2025 – TheNewswire - Vancouver, B.C. – Opawica ExplorationsInc. (FSE: A2PEAD) (OTCQB: OPWEF)(the “Company” or “Opawica”), a Canadian mineralexploration company focused on precious and base metal projects.

One of the primaries aims of the forthcoming Arrowhead Drill Programis to evaluate targets identified through the Echo-Geotech'sland-streamer 2-D seismic survey.

The Company identified four potential subvertical mineralizedtrends, marked in red (Figure 1). The two proposed drill holes areintended to intersect three of these trends. Historical drillingresults from Arrowhead, specifically hole 81-06, which yielded 8.23 Aug/t over 0.5 m, and AR-22-14, which returned 3.91 Au g/t over 1.0 m,correspond with two of the identified trends. The upcoming drillingprogram aims to explore these trends at greater depths.

The blue projected drill hole (Figure 1) is set to investigatemineralized trends 8, 4, and 5. Additionally, five seismic reflectors(depicted in blue and black) will also be examined.

The green projected drill hole is designed to assess mineralizedtrends 8 and 4 at approximately 300 meters below the blue drill hole(Figure 1). Furthermore, six seismic reflectors (shown in blue andblack) will be tested in this context.

Blake Morgan CEO stated, “Over the past few years the Opawica teamhas amassed a wealth of data by doing millions of dollars’ worth ofexploration and drilling. The seismic survey we completed was one ofthe first of its kind in this region and is now used by multiplecompanies as it brings a data set, rarely seen by a junior miningexploration company. The Opawica team is going to use this data whichshows multiple zones at multiple depth in its upcoming drill program.Abitibi is one of the most prolific gold bearing regions on earth andwith multiple active mines all around us, proven high grade on theproperty and a massive data set. The team is confident it can deliverthe high-quality results in its phase 2 drill campaign”

The drill targets were developed in partnership with ALS GoldSpotDiscoveries Ltd. and Opawica. The team combined a range of recent andhistorical drillhole datasets, encompassing geological, structural,alteration, mineralogical, geochemical, and 2D seismic data. Thisintegration has enhanced the understanding of Arrowhead’s geology.

First prospecting started in 1920 on the major shear zone located inthe northern part of the property. In 1926 the exploration worksconsisted prospecting, pitting, trenching and diamond drilling, mainlyto test two shear zones containing quartz-carbonate veins with freegold. Gold values of up to 45.05 g/t were obtained over appreciablewidths.
