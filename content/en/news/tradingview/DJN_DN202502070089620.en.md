President Donald Trump on Friday said he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs next week without specifying what countries would be the target.

His remarks came in response to a question about a Reuters report that said Trump discussed such a plan with Republican lawmakers.

The tariffs would be the next volley in a trade war pitting the U.S. against some of its largest trading partners. Trump announced levies of 25% against Canadian and Mexican imports last weekend, though suspended them for a month after the countries agreed to increased border security and measures to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S.

A separate 10% tariff against Chinese imports went into effect, and China responded with tariffs of its own.

So-called reciprocal tariffs are generally levied against other countries' imports in response to those countries' tariffs against U.S. goods.
