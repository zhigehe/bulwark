US stock futures were in the green on Monday, with contracts on the S&P 500 futures rising 0.5%, the Nasdaq 100 adding 0.7% and the Dow Jones gaining about 170 points, with traders digesting fresh tariffs and awaiting key economic data and Fed Chair Powell testimony.

President Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum into the US and said new reciprocal tariffs would also be announced this week.

Meanwhile, CPI, PPI, and retail sales reports will be released this week, providing further insights into price pressures and consumer spending strength.

Additionally, Fed Chair Powell will deliver his semiannual report to Congress, where traders will seek clues on the Fed's plans for the year.

In addition, the earnings season continues with shares of McDonald's rising about 1% in premarket trading, as same store sales for Q4 were up 0.4%, compared to an expected decline of 0.91%.
