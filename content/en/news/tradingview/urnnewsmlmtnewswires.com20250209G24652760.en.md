Trial Holdings completed the disposal of treasury shares for its restricted stock program, issuing 158,232 shares to employees at 3,420 yen each, totaling 541.2 million yen, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The payment, which closed on Jan. 30, was slightly lower than the initial plan after two employees forfeited their allotments. A separate disposal of 200 shares for an employee at a non-wholly owned subsidiary remained unchanged.
