Rogers Sugar were at last look down 0.6% in mid-morning trading on Tuesday — having been even lower — as it upsized its bought deal debenture public offering by $25 million, to $100 million. The underwriters have also been granted a 15% over-allotment option, which, if fully exercised, will raise proceeds to $115 million.

The Eighth Series convertible unsecured subordinated debentures will be offered at $1,000 each and will bear interest at 6.0% per annum. The debentures will mature on June 30, 2030.

Proceeds will be used to pay down debt on the Lantic credit facility, and for general corporate purposes.

The offering is expected to close by Feb. 19.

The company's shares were last seen down $0.06, to $5.30, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
