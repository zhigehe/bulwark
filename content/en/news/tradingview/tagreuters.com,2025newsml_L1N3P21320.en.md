Key points:

* More Trump tariff announcements expected in coming days
* Powell says Fed in no rush to cut short-term rates again, US economy 'strong overall'
* Oil bounces on Russian, Iranian supply concerns

A gauge of global stocks was little changed after erasing earlier declines, while U.S. Treasury yields advanced on Tuesday as investors assessed the latest U.S. tariff salvo and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a patient path for rate cuts.

President Donald Trump on Monday raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10%, eliminated country exceptions, as well as product-specific exclusions, and promised to announce global reciprocal tariffs within days.

But Trump also said he was considering an exemption for Australia and that the steel and aluminum measures would only take effect from March 4, keeping alive the view for some investors that the duties are being used as a negotiating tool.

Mexico, Canada and the European Union on Tuesday condemned the move, with the EU saying the 27-nation bloc would take "firm and proportionate countermeasures".

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged as the benchmark index erased its earlier declines. Powell indicated the central bank was in no rush to adjust its policy stance, and also said it was not the role of the Fed to comment on tariff or trade policy, but to react to its impact on the economy.

"It seems like he's trying to urge people to not trade off those headlines, to not make moves off those headlines and wait and see what actually happens,‚Äù said Helen Given, FX Trader at Monex USA in Washington.

"We've seen a lot of volatility come off of tariff headlines in the last two weeks. But what we're seeing now is that those headlines and those announcements are not necessarily an indication that these tariffs are actually going to be levied, at least not at the time that we think that they might be."

Markets have been slowly scaling back expectations for rate cuts from the U.S. central bank this year, largely expecting the Fed to hold rates steady at its March and May meetings. For the June Fed meeting, markets are pricing in a 51% chance for a cut of at least 25 basis points in June, down from 63.6% a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.
