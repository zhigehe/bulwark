Natural gas futures advance for a third straight session as the current cold shot across the U.S. is expected to extend into next week and strong LNG exports help offset gains in production. Thursday's weekly storage report is expected to show a 96 Bcf withdrawal, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of analysts, which would reduce the deficit over the five-year average to 63 Bcf from 111 Bcf the week before. The following two reports are likely to again widen the deficit. The Nymex front month settles up 1.3%, at $3.565/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)
