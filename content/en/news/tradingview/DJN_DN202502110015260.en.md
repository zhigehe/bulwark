Dunelm Group reported modest growth in both revenue and pretax profit in the first half, although that was driven by volumes and market-share gains, Barclays analysts Richard Taylor and Sharanya Gajapathy say in a note. While the soft-furnishing retailer's revenue rise was modest, the volume increase and stable prices are positive news and considered sustainable given that the sector is increasing prices to defend profits, they say. Added to that, Dunelm declared a pleasing special dividend of 35 pence, in line with prior year, they say. Despite the company noting a 9 million pounds inflationary headwind, it continued to invest on manufacturing capabilities, they add. (michael.susin@wsj.com)
