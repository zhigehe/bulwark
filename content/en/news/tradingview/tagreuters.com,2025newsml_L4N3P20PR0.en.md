Carlyle Group's distributable earnings for the fourth quarter missed market expectations on Tuesday, overshadowing a strong growth in the alternative asset manager's capital market business and sending its shares down 3.1% in premarket trading.

The profit miss was largely due to lower proceeds from asset sales, resulting in a 24.1% slide in earnings at its private equity business.

The asset manager's profit available to shareholders stood at $384 million, or 92 cents per share, 4 cents short of analysts' expectations, according to LSEG estimates.

Its realized performance revenue, mostly driven by asset sales from its private equity arm, fell 4.7% to $245.7 million.

Still, Carlyle achieved the financial goals laid out at the start of the last year. Under CEO Harvey Schwartz, Carlyle has prioritized margin growth and investment performance by rejigging leadership and realigning compensation model.

The asset manager reported record fee-related earnings of $287.4 million, a 13% jump from a year ago, while assets under management rose 4% to $441 billion.

Inflows stood at $14.2 billion, driven by its credit business. Carlyle retained $84 billion of unspent capital and deployed $17.6 billion in investments.

CAPITAL MARKETS SHINE

In a bright spot, Carlyle's transaction and portfolio advisory fees more than doubled to $80.6 million in the fourth quarter, exceeding Street expectations of $55.3 million.

Capital markets has been a major focus area for Carlyle since Schwartz took the mantle in early 2023. For 2024, the business had a record year.

Rival KKR last week reported strong growth in its capital markets business.

Carlyle's corporate private equity funds and real estate funds rose 1%, while global credit funds gained 3%.

In terms of exits, Carlyle in October took portfolio companies StandardAero and Rigaku public in the U.S. and Japan, respectively.

The asset manager had in December agreed to sell Italian component maker Forgital to U.S. alternative investment firm Stonepeak in a deal valued at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.55 billion).
