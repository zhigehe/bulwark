PANAMA CITY, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Gate.io—a leading global cryptocurrency exchange—choose Oracle Red Bull Racing for debut partnership in Formula One.

"Oracle Red Bull Racing", the Formula One Racing team (the "Team") and an eight-time World Drivers' Championship-winning team, is proud to announce Gate.io, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, as its exclusive Crypto Exchange Partner in a multi-year deal.

Starting from the 2025 season, Gate.io branding will feature prominently on key Team assets, including the rear wing, nose, headrest, wheel covers and chassis of the Oracle Red Bull Racing car, Team race suits, Team kit and on the helmet of four-time World Champion, Max Verstappen.
