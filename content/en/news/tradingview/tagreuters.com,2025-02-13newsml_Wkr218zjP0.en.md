Fondia Plc

Company release

2025-02-13 at 8.35 a.m. EET

In October 2021, Fondia Plc announced the company's decision to introduce a new share-based commitment and incentive plan ("the share plan"). The purpose of the share plan is to promote the achievement of the company’s financial objectives and to provide participants with a competitive long-term incentive plan, thereby increasing the company’s shareholder value. The share plan is performance-based and consists of performance periods of three financial years. The Board decides annually on the start of new performance periods, their terms and conditions, and the participants. The previous performance periods of the share plan are calendar years 2022–2024, 2023–2025 and 2024–2026.

The Fondia Board has now decided on the fourth performance period of the share plan. The fourth performance period of the share plan commences retrospectively on 1 January 2025 and concludes on 31 December 2027.

Participants in the share plan will have the opportunity to earn shares in Fondia Plc based on performance criteria set by the Board of Directors related to the financial and strategic performance of the company.

For the fourth performance period 2025–2027, the target group includes approximately 35 individuals working for Fondia Group selected by the Board.

For the 2025–2027 performance period, rewards will be based on the average operating profit percentage (EBIT%) and total shareholder return (TSR) for the performance period. Rewards will be paid in full to participants in shares of Fondia Plc. If the maximum targets set for the performance criteria for the 2025–2027 performance period are met, the total estimated value of the reward payable under the performance period is a maximum of 100,000 shares in Fondia Plc, corresponding to a value of EUR 486,800 calculated based on the average share price of Fondia's share weighted by the share turnover in January 2025. Potential rewards under the share plan will be paid after the end of the performance period until the end of May 2028.

In accordance with the terms of the plan, the Board may decide during the performance period to admit new participants to the plan. As a rule, if a participant's employment or service terminates before the payment of the reward, no reward will be paid.
