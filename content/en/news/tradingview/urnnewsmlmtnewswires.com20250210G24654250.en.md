Moody's on Feb. 7 kept the government of Luxembourg's senior unsecured and long-term issuer ratings of Aaa, with a stable outlook.

The affirmation is based on the rating agency's expectation that Luxembourg will maintain low and broadly stable debt levels, with significantly stronger debt affordability metrics than its peers.

The stable outlook mirrors Moody's view of Luxembourg's resilient credit profile amid the economic growth challenges in Europe.
