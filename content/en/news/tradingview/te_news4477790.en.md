The UK economy grew by 1.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, accelerating from an upwardly revised 1.0% expansion in the previous quarter and surpassing market expectations of 1.1%, a preliminary estimate showed.

It was the fastest GDP growth since Q4Â 2022, driven primarily by increased household consumption (1.4% vs 1.3% in Q3) and a rise in government spending (2.1% vs 0.9%).

However, fixed investment growth slowed to 1.7% (vs 3.5% in Q3) due to a 0.7% decline in business investment.

Net trade also weighed on GDP, as exports plunged 4.2% while imports rose 4.1%.

For the full year 2024, the UK economy expanded by 0.9%, up from 0.4% growth in 2023.
