CVC Capital Partners said fee-paying assets under management increased in 2024 as investment activity recovered, but added that it remains cautious on its near-term outlook.

The private equity company said Friday that as of Dec. 31, fee-paying assets under management--which represents the total value of assets under management on which management fees are charged--had increased to 147 billion euros ($153.87 billion). This compares with 98 billion euros as at Dec. 31,Â 2023.

In a full-year activity update, CVC said assets under management reached 200 billion euros by the end of last year.

The company said it remained cautious on the near-term outlook for exits from investments.

Over 2024, CVC said investment activity recovered strongly and that it was pleased with the overall resilience of its investment portfolios.

It is scheduled to publish its full-year results on March. 20.
