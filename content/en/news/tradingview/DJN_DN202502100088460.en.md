Colder weather forecasts for large parts of the U.S. help lift U.S. natural gas futures to start the week. Areas that could be affected by coming winter storms include production regions in the South and Appalachia, "and may raise concerns about potential production freeze-offs," Gelber & Associates says in a note. Also positive for natural gas, pipeline operator Energy Transfer signs an agreement to supply around 450 million cubic feet a day for Cloudburst's AI-focused data center in Texas, pending a final investment decision on the center. Transfer Energy says it's in discussions with other data center developers and "expects this to be the first of many agreements to supply, store and transport natural gas to fuel data centers, electric generation facilities and other power demand customers." The Nymex front month settles up 4.1% at $3.444/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)
