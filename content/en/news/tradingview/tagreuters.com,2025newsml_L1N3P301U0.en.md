Shares of Chinese bubble tea maker Guming rose by 0.6% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday after the company raised $232 million in an initial public offering.

The company sold 182.4 million shares at HK$9.94 a piece, the top of the price range flagged to investors when the deal launched last week.

Guming, which has 9,000 stores in China, increased the number of shares for sale in the IPO after strong demand from investors, according to its filings.

The retail tranche of the IPO was covered 195 times which meant the portion of the deal allocated to those investors was increased from 10% to 43.5%, the filings showed.

Demand from institutional investors meant that tranche of the deal was 15 times covered.
