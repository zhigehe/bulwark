**OM Info**

The MANTRA project, also known as the OMniverse, is a vertically integrated blockchain ecosystem that has been rebranded and restructured to encompass a variety of innovative products and services. These services are targeted towards both retail and institutional investors and are segmented into four primary components: MANTRA Nodes, MANTRA Chain, MANTRA Finance, and MANTRA DAO. Each of these components serves a specific role within the OMniverse, collectively creating a versatile and comprehensive crypto platform.

The OMniverse‚Äôs operation mechanism is driven by its four main components. MANTRA Nodes, the foundational stack, provide revenue generation and community growth through yield-earning opportunities on multiple blockchains, alongside node management and staking services. The MANTRA Chain is a protocol for the Cosmos ecosystem that offers interoperability with other blockchains and aids in the development of secure decentralized applications and exchanges. MANTRA Finance aims to combine the speed and transparency of DeFi with the traditional financial world, enabling non-custodial and permissionless digital asset transactions. Lastly, MANTRA DAO, embodying a transparent governance mechanism, focuses on community involvement and provides services that improve the business functions of various DAOs.

OM, the native token of the OMniverse, serves a variety of utilities within the ecosystem. Its roles include governance, enabling OM stakers to issue proposals and participate in voting processes, as well as staking, where OM can be staked directly on MANTRA‚Äús web app or Binance to earn passive yields. Through this, OM token holders are incentivized to contribute to and participate in the OMniverse‚Äùs growth and governance.
