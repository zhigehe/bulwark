Tempest Therapeutics said Monday the US Food and Drug Administration granted fast track designation to amezalpat for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer.

The company said the designation allows for increased communication with the FDA and potential eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review. The designation follows an orphan drug designation in January, Tempest added.

Tempest said amezalpat is being evaluated in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in a global phase 1b/2 trial for first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

Shares of the company were up 1.8% in recent Monday trading.
