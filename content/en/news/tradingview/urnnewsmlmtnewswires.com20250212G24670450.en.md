ASX Chief Executive Helen Lofthouse said that a disruption in the CHESS batch settlement process that occurred in December 2024 would not impact the company's overall strategy, including its technology modernization program, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

The exchange operator is conducting a "significant amount of work" under the program, and several updates are planned to be delivered soon, she added.

An investigation into the CHESS batch settlement delay by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is ongoing.

ASX shares rose nearly 9% in recent trading on Thursday.
