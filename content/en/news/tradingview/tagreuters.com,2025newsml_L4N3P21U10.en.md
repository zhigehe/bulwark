Australian power producer AGL Energy's first-half underlying profit beat analysts' estimate on Wednesday, as higher generation volumes at its Bayswater power plant helped counter lower retail margins and increased costs to run plants.

Consumer margins took a hit during the first half as customers shifted to lower-priced contracts. Higher costs to keep its thermal power plants running further ate into its profit.

The impact was partly offset by higher generation volumes at its coal-fired Bayswater power station in New South Wales, aided by improved gross margin at its electricity and gas trading business.

The country's top power producer said underlying profit was A$373 million ($234.80 million) for the six months ended December 31, compared with the Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$307.4 million.

It, however, was below the A$399 million profit reported a year earlier.

The Melbourne-headquartered firm declared an interim dividend of 23 Australian cents per share, below the 26 Australian cents declared last year.
