Gold held firm around $2,920 per ounce on Friday, heading toward a seventh consecutive weekly gain, as U.S. tariff policies continued to drive safe-haven demand.

President Trump on Thursday ordered federal agencies to explore how to adjust U.S. tariffs to match those of other countries without imposing the tariffs immediately.

Despite the delay, the move raised concerns over a potential escalation in global trade tensions, bolstering demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

On the economic data front, the U.S. producer inflation data came in stronger than expected, following a hot consumer inflation report on Wednesday.

This reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve would not be cutting interest rates in the near term.

Still, the precious metal remained resilient, supported by ongoing trade war uncertainties.

A weaker dollar also supported the bullion, making it more affordable for foreign buyers.
