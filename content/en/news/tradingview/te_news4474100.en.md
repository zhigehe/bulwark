New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ended 0.3% higher at 12,917 on Tuesday, recovering losses from the previous session, amid strength in the distribution services sector.

Shares of Vulcan Steel surged 4.0%, buoyed by its outlook for a recovery in trading volumes in New Zealand as early as the second quarter.

Additionally, utility stocks were broadly higher, with Meridian Energy rising 1.3%, Contact Energy up 0.4%, and Genesis Energy adding 0.7%.

Other notable gainers included Vector (2.3%), Ryman Healthcare (1.6%), and Precinct Properties (1.7%).

On the global front, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminum, effective on March 4, heightening concerns over a potential escalation of the trade war.
