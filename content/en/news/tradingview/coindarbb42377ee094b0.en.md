**ORN Info**

Orion Protocol is an innovative platform designed to bridge centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering users a non-custodial way to access liquidity from both. The Protocol provides an array of products that facilitate seamless trading, portfolio management, and application purchase experiences for crypto enthusiasts.

At the core of its operation, Orion Protocol boasts several distinctive products. The Orion Trading Terminal permits the execution of trades across varied exchange platforms, ensuring optimal liquidity and pricing. For those keen on tracking their digital assets, the Portfolio Management Application offers an integrated system to monitor assets, set alerts for arbitrage opportunities, and automate trading processes securely. The platform also extends its aggregated liquidity to other exchanges through Liquidity Plugins and empowers users to set up their own trading platforms with the DEX Launcher.

Central to the ecosystem is the ORN token, an ERC-20 token with multifaceted utility. Firstly, it serves as an incentive for liquidity providers or brokers through Broker Staking; by staking ORN, these brokers can increase their chances of executing orders and consequently earn fees. On the other side, non-broker individuals can stake ORN, vote for their preferred brokers, and in return, earn a share from the trading fees. Furthermore, using ORN tokens within the Orion Terminal offers users fee discounts, enhancing the token’s utility. Lastly, the token plays a crucial role in licensing, with fees being applied to several of Orion’s tools such as the Liquidity Boost Plugin and the DEX kit.
