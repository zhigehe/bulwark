US benchmark equity indexes were mixed ahead of Tuesday's close after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that policymakers don't need to rush to adjust interest rates.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3% at 19,646.5, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 44,612.6. The S&P 500 was little changed at 6,068.4. Among sectors, consumer discretionary saw the biggest drop, while energy paced the gainers.

"With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance," Powell said in prepared remarks to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

"We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."

Powell is scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.

The US 10-year yield was up 4.2 basis points at 4.54%, while the two-year rate added 2.4 basis points to 4.29%.

Government data are expected to show Wednesday that US consumer inflation rose 0.3% sequentially in January following a 0.4% gain the month prior, according to a Bloomberg poll. On an annual basis, the US consumer price index is expected to have risen 2.9% last month, unchanged from December's print.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 1.3% at $73.29 a barrel.

Gilead Sciences , DoorDash and Lyft are among the companies scheduled to report financial results after the closing bell.
