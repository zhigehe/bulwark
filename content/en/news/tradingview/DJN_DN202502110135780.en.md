Iron ore is higher in early Asia trading thanks to solid demand and supply, Nanhua Futures analysts say in a note. Chinese steel factories are likely to speed up operation resumptions in the wake of the Lunar New Year holiday, the analysts say. Still, it is unclear if domestic demand can be sustained longer term, especially after some factories placed pre-orders to catch the window before additional trade tariffs take effect, they note. The most-traded iron-ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is up 0.55% at CNY825.5/ton. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
