Most stock markets in the Gulf ended higher on Monday as investor turned their focus to corporate earnings, brushing aside U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that more tariffs were imminent, including on steel and aluminium.

In Abu Dhabi, the index gained 0.5%, led by a 6.8% jump in Aldar Properties after reporting a sharp rise in fourth-quarter profit.
