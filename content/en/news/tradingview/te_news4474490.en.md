The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note edged up to 4.52% on Tuesday, the highest level in a week, as traders brace for Fed Chair Powell's testimony to Congress for further insights on the Fed's plans for the year.

Last month, the Fed paused the rate-cut cycle and Powell said policymakers are not in a rush to cut interest rates and want to see further progress on inflation.

The CPI report due tomorrow should provide further clues on evolving price pressures.

At the same time, President Trump pushed forward with his trade policy and signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect on March 4th.

This adds to a 10% levy imposed on Chinese imports.

Such tariffs are likely to push inflation higher and limit the Fed's scope to cut rates further.

Traders are currently the Fed will reduce the fed funds rate by around 36 basis points by year-end.
