I posted headline comment earlier:

* Bank of Japan Governor Ueda says will conduct monetary policy appropriately

So far, that's it from him, Reuters have a recap up, this is it, In full!

* Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Wednesday the central bank will continue to conduct its monetary policy with the aim of achieving its 2% inflation target sustainably and stably.
* Ueda made the comments at parliament, when asked about the exit from the BOJ's massive stimulus policy.

C'mon Mr. U, get on with it!

USD/JPY has been sitting at its session high:
