The report highlights the company's robust financial performance, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in a competitive and evolving market.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Net sales:** $3,225 million, an increase of 6% from the previous year, driven by strong demand in the North America On-Highway and Defense end markets.
* **Gross profit:** $1,529 million, representing a 4% increase, primarily due to price increases and higher net sales, partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses.
* **Operating income:** $992 million, up 8% from the prior year, reflecting improved gross profit and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses.
* **Net income:** $731 million, a 9% increase compared to the previous year, attributed to higher operating income and lower interest expenses.

The North America On-Highway segment is the largest contributor, accounting for 54% of total net sales in 2024.
* **Geographical Performance:** The company has a strong presence in North America, which accounted for approximately 77% of its revenues in 2024. There was a 15% increase in net sales in the North America On-Highway market, driven by demand for Class 8 vocational and medium-duty trucks. Outside North America, the On-Highway market saw a 3% increase in net sales, with higher demand in Asia offset by lower demand in Europe.

* **New Product Launches:** Allison Transmission continues to innovate with its electrified propulsion systems, including electric hybrid and fully electric propulsion solutions, which are gaining traction in the bus market and are in development for the medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market.
* **New Production Launches:** The company has expanded its manufacturing capabilities with facilities in the United States, India, and Hungary for high-volume on-highway products, and in Auburn Hills, Michigan for fully electric propulsion solutions.
* **Future Outlook:** In 2025, Allison expects higher net sales driven by price increases on certain products, increased demand for tracked vehicle applications in the Defense end market, and robust North American vocational demand. The company is also focused on developing new products and technology to improve fuel efficiency and expand its portfolio of electric hybrid and fully electric propulsion solutions.

The company also aims to maintain compliance with all covenants under its Senior Secured Credit Facility and indentures governing the Senior Notes.

**Challenges and Risks**

* **Market Risks:** The rapid adoption of electric vehicles could outpace Allison's ability to adapt, potentially leading to a loss of market share. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and economic volatility could disrupt supply chains and affect global sales.
* **Operational Risks:** Allison faces risks related to supply chain disruptions, particularly due to its reliance on a limited number of suppliers for key components. Labor shortages and cost inflation also pose significant challenges.
* **Regulatory Risks:** Increasing environmental regulations and the need for compliance with global data protection laws could result in higher operational costs and impact product offerings.
* **Cybersecurity Risks:** The company is vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations and compromise sensitive information, especially given the heightened risk associated with defense contracts.
* **Financial Risks:** High levels of indebtedness could limit financial flexibility and increase vulnerability to economic downturns.

The company is focusing on strategic investments in research and development to enhance its product offerings and maintain competitive advantage.
* **Market Risk Management:** Allison is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect its financial performance. The company is also monitoring interest rate changes that could impact its debt servicing costs.
