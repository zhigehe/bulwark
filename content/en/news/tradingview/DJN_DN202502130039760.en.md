Data showing small, but better-than-expected, U.K. growth in the fourth quarter gift Treasury chief Rachel Reeves a slither of good news and relieves some stress on the government, says Wealth Club's Isaac Stell in a note. The government is under pressure to execute on their manifesto promise to deliver growth, says Stell, who is investment manager at the broker. "With Reeves committed to her non-negotiable fiscal rules, it is likely that public expenditure will be cut to balance the books with the prospect of additional tax hikes looming in the background." The impact of any additional taxes will likely hamper growth going forward, he says. U.K. GDP rose 0.1% between October and December. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
