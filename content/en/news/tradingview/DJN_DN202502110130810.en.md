The Philippine central bank is expected to cut its policy rate by 25 bps to 5.50% on Thursday, according to all 13 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. A weaker 2024 economic growth and moderate inflation outlook, could support the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for a rate cut, say Citi analysts in a note. January's headline CPI inflation remained within the BSP's inflation target band of 2%-4%, Goldman Sachs economist Hui Shan writes in a note. The 4Q economic growth came in modestly weaker, mainly due to slower private consumption and investment, the economist says. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
