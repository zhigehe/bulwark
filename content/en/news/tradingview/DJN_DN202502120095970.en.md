By Paul Hannon

The recent weakness of activity in the U.K. economy is likely due to supply constraints rather than soft demand, suggesting borrowing costs will have to stay restrictive to tame inflation, a Bank of England rate setter said Wednesday.

The BOE last week lowered its key interest rate for a third time since August, and said future moves will depend in part on what is behind a slowdown in growth during the second half of the year.

In a speech in London, Megan Greene said rapid rises in wages suggest the problem lies in the economy's ability to supply more goods and services, rather than weak demand.

"I think supply growth in the economy has been weakening over the past year," Greene said. "I also have concerns about it over the medium term."

With supply constrained, Greene said it will be necessary to keep the key rate at levels that restrain demand in order to bring inflation down to the BOE's 2% target.

"I believe it is appropriate to maintain a cautious and gradual approach to removing monetary restrictiveness," she said.
