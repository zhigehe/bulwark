Andreas Enger, CEO of Höegh Autoliners, comments: "2024 was a remarkable yearfor Höegh Autoliners. We achieved strong financial results in the fourthquarter, with an operating profit of USD 179 million and a net profit aftertaxof USD 138 million. Our efforts to build a quality contract backlog have beensuccessful, as evidenced by several long-term contracts signed with leadingOEMsglobally during the last quarter. We maintain our confidence in providingtop-tier, environmentally friendly transport solutions, bolstered by theaddition of the three new Aurora-class vessels in the fleet. Creating valuestoour shareholders remains one of our top priorities, and I am pleased toannouncea quarterly dividend of USD 90 million to be paid in March. I extend myheartfelt gratitude to all our employees, partners and customers for theirsupport during 2024."

Outlook On the back of several new contracts signed during 2024, Höegh Autolinersstarts2025 with the strongest contract backlog the Company has ever had. Followingthenormal seasonal slowdown in the beginning of the year, we expect Q1 volumes tobe in line with recent quarters.

The delivery of newbuilds will gradually remove some of the pressure seen inoursegment, but the general market remains strong with more volume than we cancarry in key trade lanes.

With regards to transiting the Red Sea, we maintain regular communication withrelevant stakeholders and monitor the situation continuously.

The geopolitical landscape is unpredictable and uncertainty has increased overthe last few weeks with threats of and introduction of new tariffs. HöeghAutoliners´ direct exposure so far is limited, but generally any tariff willnegatively effect the overall market.

We expect an EBITDA result for Q1 slightly below same quarter last year.

Please find attached the Q4 2024 report. The results will also be presented byCEO Andreas Enger and CFO Espen Stubberud at 08:30 CET today. The presentationwill be held in English, and a recorded version of the webcast together withthepresentation will be made available on our website soon after the webcastends.Link to watch the webcast:https://investors.hoeghautoliners.com/investors/reports-and-other-resources/webcasts-and-videos/default.aspx
