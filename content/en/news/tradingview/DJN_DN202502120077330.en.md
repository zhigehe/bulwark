Danish lender Danske Bank on Wednesday issued $500 million in 5-year Additional Tier 1 bonds.

The bonds have an initial pricing of around 7.625% and a reset date on August 19,Â 2030.

AT1 bonds are a risky form of debt issued by banks to meet regulatory capital requirements.

Credit research company CreditSights estimates the bonds' fair value at a yield of around 7.125%, it said in a note.
