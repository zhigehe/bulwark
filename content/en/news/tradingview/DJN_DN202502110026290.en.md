Merck KGaA's potential acquisition of SpringWorks Therapeutics puts Merck's healthcare business strategy into question, Equita analyst Davide Marchesin says in a note. The German pharma company previously said it would focus on licensing agreements rather than full acquisitions for its healthcare business. "Taking over SpringWorks Therapeutics would not be in line with such statement, increasing the market skepticism about Merck's strategy," the analyst says. Shares are down 0.1% at 134.85 euros.(helena.smolak@wsj.com)
