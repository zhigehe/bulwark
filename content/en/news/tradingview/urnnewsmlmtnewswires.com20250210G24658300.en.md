German equities kicked off a new trading week in the green, with investors in a wait-and-see mode after US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Amid a quiet day for local economic news, the blue-chip DAX index was 0.57% higher at closing.

"Markets fear that Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" ... could further weigh on the already gloomy growth outlook for the euro area (note that most German exports still went to the US in December 2024 and Germany also runs its largest trade surplus with the US)," Commerzbank said.

Aside from tariff news, market watchers will also be on the lookout for key economic data releases this week, including the latest industrial production and gross domestic product reports for the eurozone.

"Industrial production data for December (Thursday) will highlight how the factory sector continued to weigh significantly on economic activity at the end of 2024. Reflecting particular weakness in Germany, we think aggregate euro area IP declined about 3/4%M/M in December, to leave it down around 1/2%Q/Q in Q4. As a result, we also expect the updated estimate of Q4 GDP (Friday) to confirm the initial estimate of zero growth," Daiwa Capital Markets wrote.

On the corporate side, Bayer is seeking approval for an extended six-month interval for Eylea in treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema patients in the European Union. The stock was 0.36% at closing.

Porsche AG gained 1.29%, recovering some of the losses it saw last week when it unveiled an 800 million-euro restructuring cost. Berenberg lowered the stock to hold from buy, with its price target down to 62 euros from 75 euros.
