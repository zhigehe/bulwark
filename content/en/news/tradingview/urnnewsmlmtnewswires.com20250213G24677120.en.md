Everest Metals said the commissioning phase of the bulk sampling program at the Revere gold project enabled on-site gold extraction using the Gekko Gravity gold processing plant, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

The Gekko plant achieved 10 tonnes-per-hour plate capacity. It processed 1,700 tonnes of stockpiled material and produced around 1.4 tonnes of gold concentrate by the end of January.

The sampling program is designed to convert the current exploration target into a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate.
