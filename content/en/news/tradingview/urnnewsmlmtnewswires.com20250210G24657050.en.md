Synergia Energy said Monday it plans to drill three new wells at the Cambay site in India to boost its production and cash flow.

The $20 million work program carried out by Selan Exploration involves two vertical wells followed by a multi-stage fracked horizontal well, with drilling scheduled to start in the second quarter, subject to rig availability. The initial well will be vertically fracked, targeting the extensive Eocene gas reservoir.

The natural gas resources development company issued a tender for a drilling rig and services, with Selan ready to redeploy its rig to Cambay from Assam if needed.
