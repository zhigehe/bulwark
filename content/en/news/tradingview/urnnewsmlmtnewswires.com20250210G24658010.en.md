Barclays revised its 2025 estimates for L'Oréal on the back of the company's optimistic guidance amid expectations of a cyclical operational underperformance and a subdued beauty market in China.

"Upbeat 25e guidance is not necessarily good news, as it creates the risk that expectations remain elevated and we see further downgrades at 1Q25e. We continue to expect 6%+ OSG in 2H25e, but think shares could drift near term," analysts said in a Monday note.

Analysts now expect the France-based cosmetics giant's organic sales growth at 4.2% in 2025, down from the previous 4.8%, primarily due to tougher comparisons in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the EPS forecast increased by 2%, mainly due to lower-than-expected tax rates, with the company beating EPS estimates in 2024.

Barclays' long-term projections, however, remain largely unchanged, with 6.1% organic sales expected for 2026 and EPS down slightly by 0.5% to reflect the reduced organic sales growth in 2025.

The stock has an overweight rating, while the price target was lowered to 422 euros from 424 euros.
