Challenger Gold said it is progressing towards mining and toll milling readiness at its Hualilan gold project in Argentina, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

The firm completed final open pit mine design and mining schedules for toll milling pits, the filing said.

Its completed mining schedule optimizes the delivery of high-grade mineralization, frontloading material grading 8.7 grams per tonne of gold, and 34.5 g/t of silver in the first year.

Austral Gold, the toll mill operator, indicated that refurbishment of the Casposo plant is progressing, the filing added.

It has decided to advance to the pre-ferability study phase for toll milling at the project and it engaged a number of consultants to help complete the study.

Challenger's shares jumped 10% in recent trading on Tuesday.
