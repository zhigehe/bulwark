Orora's earnings guidance is likely to trigger more downgrades to market forecasts, reckons Jefferies. Orora signaled 2H EBIT would be in line with a year earlier, which implies a 9% miss to consensus hopes, analyst Henry Copley says. That view appears to be reflected in Orora's stock falling 3.9% to A$2.25 today. The share-price decline is despite Orora's 1H net profit exceeding expectations on lower net interest costs and tax. Jefferies has a buy call and A$3.00 price target on Orora. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)
