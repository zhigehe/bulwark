Key points:

* Hungarian base rate is joint highest in European Union
* Market awaits appointment of new Hungarian governor
* Hungarian January CPI higher than expected
* Poland's zloty approaches seven-year highs

The Hungarian forint firmed on Tuesday after data showed Hungary's inflation (HUCPIY=ECI) picked up to an annual 5.5% in January, exceeding analyst forecasts, and reducing the central bank's scope to resume interest rate cuts soon.

Monthly price growth accelerated to its fastest pace in two years, driven by rises in food, services and fuel prices.

Hungary's central bank left its base rate steady at 6.5% last month, the joint highest in the European Union, and said the risk of higher inflation and volatility in emerging markets called for tight monetary policy.

"Inflation came in at an annual 5.5% in January which exceeds our expectations and also the analyst consensus," MHB bank analysts said. "The forint started to firm after the data release and strengthened past 403.50 to the euro."

Erste Bank analyst Janos Nagy said the bank would revise upwards its 4.5% annual forecast for 2025 inflation to reflect the data.

"The current and projected pace of price growth gives no room for rate cuts in the short term," Nagy said in a note.

The forint traded 0.3% higher at 403.35 versus the euro at 0818 GMT, outperforming its regional peers. The Hungarian unit was a constant underperformer last year in Central Europe.

Investors await news on new leadership at the National Bank of Hungary as the mandate of Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy expires next month.

In December Prime Minister Viktor Orban nominated Mihaly Varga, his finance minister, to the post and Varga said the "primary aim of the central bank is to achieve and maintain price stability".

Investors will be watching to see whether this commitment is put in practice.

"The present Monetary Council has ruled out rate cuts for an extended period of time, but this MPC is now viewed as ‘outgoing’ and its policy commitments no longer re-assure the market," Commerzbank said in a note.

Elsewhere, Poland's zloty , which climbed near to seven-year-highs on Monday, buoyed by the central bank's hawkish stance and the prospect of a potential peace plan for [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/), traded flat at around 4.1835 to the euro.

"The zloty remains under the influence of positive global sentiment...This, in turn, may be influenced by today's speech by Fed Chairman J. Powell in the U.S. Senate, as well as tomorrow's CPI inflation data in the U.S.," Bank Millenium said in a note.

"The decline in expectations for interest rate cuts in the U.S. and the accompanying strengthening of the dollar will make it difficult for the Polish currency to strengthen further."
