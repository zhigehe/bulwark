Aldi is selling about 160 Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket stores in the U.S. in a deal with a consortium that includes the chains' original parent company Southeastern Grocers, C&S Wholesale Grocers, and private investors.

The German discount grocery chain on Friday said that the deal will allow it to create a focused conversion portfolio in the southeast as part of its five-year growth strategy. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Aldi plans to open more than 225 new store locations and convert Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket stores to the Aldi format. The company plans to convert approximately 220 Southeastern Grocers locations to its format through 2027. Last year, Aldi opened nearly 120 stores, bringing its total store count to over 2,400.

Aldi has owned Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket for less than a year. In August 2023, the company disclosed that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire both supermarkets from Southeastern Grocers, with the transaction set to close in the first half of 2024.
