Bayer and its US partner Regeneron presented data showcasing the high durability and long-term efficacy and safety of 8 milligrams of its retinal disease drug Eylea at the end of three years.

The data came from an open-label extension study of the clinical trial Pulsar in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, according to a Feb. 7 release.

The German pharmaceutical and biotechnology group said patients on Eylea exhibited sustained visual acuity gains and fluid control through three years.
