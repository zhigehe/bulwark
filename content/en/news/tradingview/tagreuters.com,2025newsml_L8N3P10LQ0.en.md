European spot prices for Tuesday fell on Monday, with a rise in average wind power output set to outweigh increasing demand.

German day-ahead (TRDEBD1) power was at 120.75 euros ($124.77) per megawatt per hour (MWh) by 0935 GMT, down 9.7% from Friday's price for Monday, LSEG data showed.

French baseload power for Tuesday (TRFRBD1) was at 144.50 euros/MWh, LSEG data showed. The contract for Monday delivery was untraded on Friday.

Residual load is decreasing in Germany on Tuesday because of increased wind supply, with exports from the country expected throughout the day, said LSEG analyst Florine Enengl.

German wind power output was expected to rise by 4.7 gigawatts (GW) to 30.7 GW on Tuesday while French output was projected to shed 1.8 GW to 2.4 GW, LSEG data showed.

French nuclear availability was flat at 82% of total capacity as two new planned reactor maintenance outages replaced reactors coming back online.

Power consumption in Germany is expected to increase by 1.6 GW to 63.4 GW on Tuesday while demand in France is forecast to rise by 1.4 GW to 66.6 GW, LSEG data showed.

German year-ahead power (TRDEBYZ6) was up 2.1% at 102.40 euros/MWh.

The front year continuous contract (TRDEBYc1) earlier touched its highest since November 25 at 102.80 euros.

"Temperatures in Germany are expected below average this entire week," Energi Danmark analysts said.

With European gas contracts continuing to rise early on Monday, German power also looks set to rise further, they added.

The French front-year continuous contract (TRFRBYZ6) rose 3.7% to 74.25 euros/MWh, its highest since December 30.

In the European carbon market (CFI2Zc1), the benchmark contract was up 1.7% at 83.65 euros a metric ton.
