While Incitec Pivot's latest trading update is slightly negative for FY25 earnings, the market should largely look through it, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note. "The key investment and valuation drivers remain on track," they say. Those drivers are the Dyno Nobel transformation measures, targeting roughly A$300 million EBIT uplift, and the FY25 timing of its planned fertilizers separation, they say. RBC keeps an outperform rating and A$3.90 target. Incitec is down 0.5% at A$2.955/share. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)
