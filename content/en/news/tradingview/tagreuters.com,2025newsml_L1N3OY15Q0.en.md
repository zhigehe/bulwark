ICE canola futures rose on Friday, with the March contract (RSH5) hitting its highest since mid-November on tighter-than-expected Canadian canola stockpiles and short-covering, traders said.

* March canola (RSH5) settled up $6.60 at $656.80 per metric ton after reaching $658.10, the contract's highest level since November 19.
* Statistics Canada reported canola stocks as of December 31 at 11.382 million metric tons, down 19.2% from a year earlier and below an average of trade expectations for 11.85 million.
* Farmers have already sold much of their old-crop canola and are holding out for higher prices before booking further sales, a factor that helped support futures.
* Strength in competing world vegetable oil markets lent support. Malaysian palm oil futures surged 2.3% on Friday and Chicago Board of Trade soyoil futures (BOv1) rose 1.3% to settle at 45.98 U.S. cents per pound.
* European May rapeseed futures (COMK5) bucked the firm trend, ending down 1.2%.
* Traders shrugged off strength in the Canadian dollar, which can curb export demand for Canadian goods. The loonie strengthened against its U.S. counterpart, adding to its weekly gain, as stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data kept expectations in check for another Bank of Canada interest rate cut in March.
