A consortium that includes Bharat Heavy Electricals and Hitachi Energy India has received a letter of intent for a renewable energy transmission project from Rajasthan Part I Power Transmission, according to a Sunday filing to the Indian stock exchanges.

Rajasthan Part I Power Transmission is a special purpose vehicle under Adani Energy Solutions.

The project involves the design and execution of a high voltage direct current (HVDC) link, along with associated AC substations. This infrastructure will transmit renewable energy from Bhadla III in Rajasthan, India and Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh.

The contract is scheduled to be completed by 2030.
