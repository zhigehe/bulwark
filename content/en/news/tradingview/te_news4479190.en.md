Singapore's current account surplus narrowed to SGD 28.81 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 from SGD 25.90 billion in the same period of 2023.

It was the smallest current account surplus since Q4 of 2023, as the goods account surplus fell sharply to SGD 48.18 billion from SGD 55.05 billion in Q4 of 2023, amid a surge in imports.

Additionally, the secondary income gap increased to SGD 2.48 billion from SGD 1.95 billion.

Meanwhile, the services account surplus widened to SGD 15.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 from SGD 11.97 billion, mainly due to higher transport and freight services.
