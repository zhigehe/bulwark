Microsoft has offered to increase the price difference between Office bundled with Teams app and one without the chat and video conferencing app to avoid a possible EU fine, Reuters reported Monday.

The company's offer comes on the heels of a prior complaint by Germany-based alfaview in 2023 and a similar complaint by Salesforce-owned (CRM) Slack five years ago, the publication reported.

Since 2023, Microsoft Office with and without Teams have been priced just 2 euros apart, according to the report.

The European Commission has asked companies to provide feedback on Microsoft's offer this week before it decides whether it needs to conduct a formal market test.

Microsoft and the commission did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comments.
