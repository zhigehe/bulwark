The National Bank of Serbia kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.75% in February 2025, along with deposit (4.5%) and lending facility rates (7.0%).

The rate has been at this level since September 2024, following three 25-basis-point cuts in June, July, and September.

Policymakers said that despite inflation stabilizing at 4.3% in December, global risks like geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism require cautious monetary policy.

Serbia's GDP grew 3.9% in 2024, supported by industry, services, and infrastructure projects.

Looking ahead, the bank expects inflation to stay within target, slowing mid-2025.
