China's State Council announced on Monday its commitment to bolstering domestic consumption this year, emphasizing the importance of stabilizing foreign investment, which is vital for job creation.

During a weekly meeting chaired by Premier Li Qiang, the Chinese cabinet outlined plans to increase residents' incomes, promote sustainable income growth, and expand income channels related to property.

However, the meeting did not specify the mechanisms or measures for achieving these income increases.

The government also pledged to strengthen support for trade-in programs while boosting spending in key sectors such as culture, sports, and inbound tourism.

Analysts anticipate that Beijing will propose expanded pension and healthcare coverage during the upcoming annual legislative meeting in March.

This gathering is also expected to reveal China's economic growth target for 2025, alongside other supportive policies aimed at sustaining economic momentum.
