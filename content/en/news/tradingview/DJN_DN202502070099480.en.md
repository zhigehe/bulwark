Lean hog futures on the CME finish up 0.4% to 92.55 cents a pound — while live cattle futures close unchanged at $1.974 a pound. For livestock, managed money fund traders have amassed a large long position in both cattle and hogs. While this means that funds expect hog and cattle prices to go up, it's also why trading volumes were light on Friday — because many are unwilling to risk money on new positions in the event of a surprise tariff-related announcement by President Trump over the weekend. "The uncertainty is definitely adding another element of volatility to the livestock markets," says livestock trader Dan Norcini. "In truth, in my view, the only people who like this sort of thing are the pestilential algo players." (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
