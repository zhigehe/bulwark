BROOKFIELD, NEWS, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Brookfield Wealth Solutions (NYSE, TSX: BNT) today announced financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024.

Our scalable North American annuity platform, coupled with our leading investment capabilities, will serve as the foundation for our business as we expand internationally in 2025.”

**2024 Highlights**

* Completed the acquisition of American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (“AEL”), doubling the size of our business
* Deployed more than $17 billion across our investment portfolio at strong risk-adjusted returns
* Generated $19 billion in annuity and pension risk transfer (“PRT”) sales across the business, consisting of approximately $14 billion of retail annuity sales, inclusive of a full twelve months of activity at AEL, and $5 billion of PRT deals
* We closed our first U.K. reinsurance transaction, reinsuring £1.0 billion ($1.3 billion) of pension liabilities

**Operating Update**We recognized $427 million and $1.4 billion of distributable operating earnings (“DOE”) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to $258 million and $745 million in the prior year periods. The increase in earnings for the current period reflects contributions from our acquisition of AEL as well as higher net investment income resulting from progress made in repositioning assets into higher yielding investment strategies. DOE further benefitted from strong annuity sales during the year.

We recorded net income of $576 million and $1.2 billion for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to net income of $453 million and $797 million in the prior year periods. Net income in the current period is the result of strong operating performance and contributions from our DOE, as well as favorable movement on reserves due to interest rate and equity market movements.

Today, we are in a strong liquidity position, with approximately $31 billion of cash and short-term liquid investments across our investment portfolios, and another $21 billion of long-term liquid investments. These liquid assets will support the ongoing rotation of our portfolio into higher yielding investment strategies, while ensuring we have sufficient liquidity coverage for our liabilities in the case of any stress events impacting the broader market.

**Regular Distribution Declaration**The Board declared a 13% increase in the Company’s quarterly return of capital to $0.09 per class A share and class B share (representing $0.36 per annum), payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on March 14, 2025. This distribution is identical in amount per share and has the same payment date as the quarterly distribution announced today by Brookfield Corporation on the Brookfield class A shares.

**Brookfield Corporation Operating Results**An investment in class A shares of our company is intended to be, as nearly as practicable, functionally and economically, equivalent to an investment in the Brookfield class A shares. A summary of Brookfield Corporation’s fourth quarter and full year operating results is provided below:

Brookfield Corporation net income above is presented under IFRS.
