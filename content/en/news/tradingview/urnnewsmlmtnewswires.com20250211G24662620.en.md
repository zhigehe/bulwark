Jiangsu Lopal Tech and Contemporary Amperex Technology will relaunch the operations of their lithium carbonate refinery in China following a five-month hiatus, The Standard reported Monday.

The refinery is seen to produce about 3,500 tons in February, the report said, citing Lopal's representative.

The reopening of the refinery is seen to put pressure on prices, which have declined nearly 90% since late 2022 due to oversupply, according to the report.
