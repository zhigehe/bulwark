Stock exchange release

February 13, 2025 at 11.45 am EET

Share rewards from Outokumpu’s share-based incentive programs

Outokumpu’s Board of Directors has approved the share rewards from Outokumpu’s share-based incentive programs – Performance Share Plan and Restricted Share Pool.

For the Performance Share Plan’s plan period 2022–2024, the targets were met at 85.4%. Targets were return on capital employed (80% weight) and CO2 emission reduction per ton of crude steel produced (20% weight). Therefore, 564,781 gross shares will be delivered to the participants in February 2025.

In the Restricted Share Pool, the participants will receive 164,798 shares of the plan period 2022–2024 (third and last installment or only installment), 56,198 gross shares of the plan period 2023–2025 (second installment) and 122,083 gross shares of the plan period 2024–2026 (first installment). A total number of 343,079 gross shares will be delivered to the participants of the Restricted Share Pool in February 2025.

Outokumpu will use its treasury shares for the reward payments, which means that the total number of shares of the company will not change. Upon delivery, applicable taxes will be deducted from gross shares, and the remaining net value will be paid to the participants in Outokumpu shares.
