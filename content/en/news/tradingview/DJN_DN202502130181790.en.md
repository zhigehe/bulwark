Bank Indonesia is likely to lower rates further in 2025, HSBC Global Research economists say, noting the central bank's unexpected rate cut in January. The main driver of the cut seemed to be growth worries, with BI reducing its 2025 growth forecast, the economists say. Together with soft growth momentum, Indonesia's new fiscal expenditure plans may not completely solve the country's growth problem, they say. Also, domestic inflation will likely remain in the central bank's target range, opening up room for monetary easing. HSBC now expects a 25bps rate cut at the March meeting, a 25bps rate cut in 2Q and two 25bps rate cuts in 3Q. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
