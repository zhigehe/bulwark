Bitcoin is due to hit a giant $700,000 this cycle thanks to a “massive liquidity injection.”

In X posts on Feb. 8, Bill Barhydt, founder and CEO of crypto asset manager Abra, said that he expects “cyclical Valhalla” to start in Q1.

**Barhydt: Crypto “liquidity injections” coming in Q1**

Bitcoin at $350,000 is now the “base case” for Abra’s Bill Barhydt, a longtime crypto industry executive.

In his latest round of price predictions, Barhydt confirmed not only hitting a cycle peak of $700,000 but equally lofty targets for Ether , Solana and more.

The reason, he argues, boils down to the new US government administration under President Donald Trump.

“My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower and they’ll do whatever they have to to achieve that,” one post explains.

“They also need to refinance over $7T in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE or some other means.”

Barhydt referred to a form of liquidity boost called quantitative easing, or QE — effectively increasing the money supply with crypto and risk assets as two key beneficiaries.

“Cyclical Valhalla is coming,” he added, with another post giving Q1 as the likely deadline for such liquidity injections to begin.

The “base case” calls for to hit $8,000, while is due to reach $900.

“High end of range is ~2x these values,” Barhydt added.

**Room for a 25% BTC price crash?**

Bitcoin and altcoins are no strangers to sky-high price predictions this year while consolidation kicks in around the start of the Trump presidency.

Various major global firms have issued targets of $200,000 or more, with the numbers only increasing toward the next decade.

Some, however, see pain coming for hodlers first. Among them is Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, who this week warned that the new administration is not a silver bullet for price growth.

“As the global community quickly realizes that politics in America didn’t change that dramatically just because Trump got elected, the price of cryptos will fall to levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2024,” he wrote in his latest blog post.

“My call for a retest of $70,000 to $75,000 Bitcoin still stands.”
