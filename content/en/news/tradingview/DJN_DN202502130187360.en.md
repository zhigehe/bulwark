CelcomDigi's 2025 earnings outlook appears promising as depreciation costs ease post-merger and service revenue is guided for low single-digit growth versus a 0.6% decline in 2024, Kenanga IB analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan says in a note. Post-merger synergies are expected to generate annual cost savings of MYR700 million-MYR800 million by 2027, she notes. However, 5G access fees to Digital Nasional, Malaysia's sole 5G service provider, may rise in 2025 under new conditions coming into effect, though the exact amount remains uncertain, she says. With network integration progressing well, CelcomDigi's outlook remains positive, she adds. Kenanga raises CelcomDigi's target price to MYR4.10 from MYR3.82, while maintaining an outperform rating on the stock. Shares are 7.2% lower at MYR3.59.(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
