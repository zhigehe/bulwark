VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 7, 2025 / **Zeus North America Mining Corp.** (CSE:**ZEUS**)(OTCQB:**ZUUZF**)(FRANKFURT:**O92**) (the "**Company**" or "**Zeus**") is pleased to provide a corporate update on 2024 exploration at the Cuddy Mountain project in Idaho, less than 3 km to the north of the Hercules Metals high grade copper-gold-silver porphyry discovery announced in October 2023.

Highlights of the 2024 Exploration Program at Cuddy Mountain:

* Staked 19 additional BLM Lode Claims to cover areas underlain by the Seven Devils Volcanics, which host the neighboring Leviathan Porphyry Copper mineralization.
* Completed a property wide 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization ("IP") and Resistivity Survey using Dias Geophysical Ltd.
* Conducted a property wide Ground Magnetic Survey totalling 105-line km of high-resolution magnetic data.
* Collected 799 soil samples and 339 rock grab samples.
* Completed a property wide mapping campaign. The mapped stratigraphy within the Cuddy Mountain Property demonstrates that the same stratigraphic section exists with the Property as that shown-on Hercules drill sections which intersected porphyry mineralization.

Dean Besserer, President and CEO, stated, "Our 2024 exploration program data compilation is nearly complete, and we are excited to release our results and advance towards drilling in this highly prospective region. We are excited about how 2025 is shaping up with our existing projects, numerous opportunities to aid in the growth of the company, and the Trump administration solidifying the United States' pathway towards domestic energy and mineral security."

The summer programs consisted of property wide mapping, sampling and geophysics including: 799 soil samples; 339 rock grab samples; mapping and property wide ground magnetics and 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization ("IP") and resistivity surveys.

Importantly, the mapped stratigraphy within the Cuddy Mountain Property demonstrates that the same stratigraphic section exists with the Property as that shown on Hercules drill sections which intersected porphyry mineralization.

All results have been received and are being integrated into a data set which will be released shortly.

Additionally, Governor Brad Little signed Executive Order 2025-02, the Strategic Permitting, Efficiency, and Economic Development (SPEED) Act, aimed at better coordinating state permitting on big projects that promote energy independence, support national security, and drive the economy. The establishment of a SPEED Council is expected to create a more efficient regulatory process in Idaho while maintaining environmental oversight.

"Idaho leads the nation in streamlining regulations and promoting good government, but there is always more we can do to improve. With President Trump's return to the White House, there is a renewed focus on efficiency in government at the federal level. In that same spirit, here in Idaho we are going to take even more steps to make sure state government does not get in the way of projects that support our economy," Governor Little said.
