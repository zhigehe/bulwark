(Updates shares.)

Talisker Resources on Tuesday said pre-construction activities at the Bralorne gold project in British Columbia are underway.

The company said all operational staff including the mining contractor have arrived at the site. Ground control management and ventilation plans have been finalized, while minor ground support rehabilitation, installation of ventilation and safety infrastructure are expected to be completed by the end of February.

Development remains on schedule to begin in March at an advance rate of 6 meters per day on the Mustang 1060 Level, Talisker said.

"With all time high gold prices we are excited to be finalising our pre-development activities and eagerly look forward to our first blast for 2025 setting the basis for a transformational year for Talisker," chief executive Terry Harbort said.

Talisker shares were last seen up $0.015 to $0.38 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
