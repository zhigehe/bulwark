South Korea's key manufacturing sectors plan to invest 119 trillion won this 2025, up 4% from last year's investment of 114 trillion won, despite economic challenges, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Wednesday.

Semiconductor firms will focus on "cutting edge"memory chips amid increasing AI demand, while automakers seek to boost EV investments. However, secondary battery and steel investments are expected to decline due to weak demand and oversupply.

Firms urged the government to extend investment tax credits and provide stronger financial support, the release said.
