Spot basis bids for corn were up, wheat bids were down and soy bids were steady in the U.S. Midwest on Friday, spot checks showed, as futures ticked down and market players expressed renewed worries that trade disputes could hurt demand for U.S. farm products.

\* The wheat basis fell at a Chicago elevator and processor.

\* The corn basis rose at a Nebraska elevator and Iowa elevator.

\* U.S. President Donald Trump said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, confirming a report by Reuters. Grain traders worry the duties may spark retaliation from importers that would dent U.S. crop sales.

\* On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is slated to update global supply and demand estimates in a monthly report. Global wheat imports are likely to drop this year.

\* Most-active CBOT corn futures ended down 7-3/4 cents at $4.87-1/2 a bushel but remained close to a 15-month peak of $4.98-1/2 reached on Wednesday.

\* Soybean futures fell 11 cents to $10.49-1/2 a bushel after rising on Wednesday to a six-month peak of $10.79-3/4. Wheat finished 5 cents weaker at $5.82-3/4 a bushel, down from a 3-1/2 month high of $5.92-1/2.
