The Malaysian ringgit is expected to trade between 4.42 and 4.47 against the U.S. dollar next week, supported by stable domestic macro indicators, Kenanga economists say in a note. Markets now anticipate one Fed rate cut in September this year, though Kenanga still sees two cuts contingent on Trump's tariff policies and potential retaliation. While U.S. reciprocal tariffs are delayed until April, risk sentiment remains cautious, they say. Traders will monitor Russia-Ukraine geopolitical developments, U.S. retail sales data as key drivers for the pair, they add. Kenanga pegs USD/MYR's short-term resistance at 4.459 and support at 4.425. USD/MYR is 0.3% lower at 4.4420. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
