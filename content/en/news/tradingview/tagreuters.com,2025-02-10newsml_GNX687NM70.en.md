SHANGHAI, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — ECARX Holdings, Inc. (“ECARX” or the “Company”), a global mobility tech provider, today announced a significant upgrade to its ECARX AutoGPT in-vehicle AI large model application with the integration of the DeepSeek-R1 model, resulting in a faster, more secure, and more personalized user experience. This advancement expands AutoGPT's local processing capabilities and enhances its reasoning and decision-making abilities for automotive-specific application scenarios.

The integration of the DeepSeek-R1 model enables local execution of complex tasks, thereby reducing reliance on cloud resources. This localization improves data privacy, lowers latency, and decreases data transmission and storage costs. It ensures that data is handled in compliance with local privacy regulations and reduces security certification costs for our growing domestic and overseas customer base.

Ziyu Shen, co-founder, Chairman and CEO of ECARX, commented, "Integrating DeepSeek-R1 into ECARX AutoGPT marks a significant leap forward in our capabilities, enhancing the overall user experience of our intelligent cockpits and delivering substantial cost and data privacy benefits to our increasingly diverse customer base globally. This upgrade highlights the unique value proposition we offer to global automakers with our cutting-edge technology and growing ecosystem of strategic partnerships — something we believe is crucial to driving the long-term sustainable development of the global automotive industry as it evolves towards software-defined vehicles."

ECARX AutoGPT was designed specifically for automotive applications with its core AutoAgent, AutoFlow, AutoScene and AutoEco capabilities built on top of several of the world’s leading large language models to enhance the in-vehicle experience. Furthermore, the AutoAgent capability allows automakers to offer customizable services, adapting to unique driver preferences and creating more engaging user experiences. The integration of the DeepSeek-R1 model strengthens the reasoning, decision-making, understanding, analysis and recommendation of these core capabilities, particularly for complex in-vehicle interactions and cross-domain scenarios.

With DeepSeek-R1 integrated, ECARX AutoGPT now offers smarter, safer, more flexible and efficient in-vehicle solutions for global automakers through an open and collaborative ecosystem of global partnerships that is consistently innovating to deliver the next generation of automotive intelligence.
