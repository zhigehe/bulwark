Memphasys completed a clinical trial of its advanced sperm selection technology, Felix System, for assisted reproductive technology procedures, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

It achieved the last patient visit in the trial, with all required patient visits, including pregnancy outcomes completed, the filing said.

Data lock is anticipated in around two weeks, following a final data clean-up, management, and source verification phase.

It will use the trial data as part of its ongoing CE Mark submission to advanced commercialization activities in Europe. Regulatory approvals in Australia and India are expected to follow soon after.

The firm's shares rose past 14% on market close on Tuesday.
