Malaysian palm oil futures inched higher on Friday, supported by firmer crude oil prices, and were on track for a fourth straight weekly gain, as market players awaited export data from cargo surveyors for further cues.

The benchmark palm oil contract for April delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 20 ringgit, or 0.44%, to 4,574 ringgit ($1,030.18) a metric ton in early trade. It has risen 1.62% so far this week.

\* Palm oil tracks price movements of rival edible oils, as it competes for a share of the global vegetable oils market.

\* Cargo surveyors are expected to release their estimates on Malaysian palm oil exports for February 1-15 on Saturday.

\* Oil prices climbed amid rising fuel demand and expectations that Trump's plans for reciprocal global tariffs would not come into effect until April, giving more time to avoid a trade war. O/R

\* Stronger crude oil futures make palm a more attractive option for biodiesel feedstock.

\* The ringgit , palm's currency of trade, strengthened 0.34% against the dollar, making the commodity more expensive for buyers holding foreign currencies.

\* Palm oil may retest support at 4,540 ringgit per ton, a break below which could open the way towards 4,437 ringgit to 4,488 ringgit range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. TECH/C
