AMTD Group and its subsidiary World Media and Entertainment Universal, jointly established by AMTD Group, AMTD IDEA Group and AMTD Digital, secured a significant legal victory in Hong Kong.

They won a successful action in the Hong Kong courts against Luxury Village and its director Dimitri Voronstov for their infringement of L'Officiel's intellectual property, a filing with the Singapore Exchange said on Tuesday.

The company reported that the defendants had been using intellectual property rights owned by AMTD relating to L'Officiel magazines and took swift legal action.

Following the legal action, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance issued an order in favor of the claimants and prevented the defendants from using L'Officiel brand.
