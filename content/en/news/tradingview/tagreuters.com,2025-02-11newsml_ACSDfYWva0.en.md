TORONTO, ON / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 / abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Investment Fund VCC (UEN: T21VC0235H) (the "Company"), a closed-end investment company trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, announced today that it will pay a monthly distribution of CAD 1.75 cents per share on February 28, 2025 to all shareholders of record as of February 21, 2025 (ex-dividend date February 21, 2025).

The policy of the Company's Board of Directors is to maintain a stable monthly distribution. For the 12 months to January 31, 2025, the Company has paid total distributions amounting to CAD 21.0 cents per ordinary share.

As a Singapore domiciled company, all distribution payments will be treated as foreign income for Canadian income tax purposes. Shareholders with registered addresses in Canada will receive distributions in Canadian dollars unless they have elected otherwise.

The Company's estimated sources of the current fiscal year to date distributions is as follows:

| Total  Distributions Dividends Declared Fiscal Year to Date  (Foreign Income) | $0.0700 |
| --- | --- |
| Estimated Component of Distribution from Earnings | $0.0700 |
| Estimated Component of Distribution in Excess of Available Net Investment Income | $0.0000 |

Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Company's investment performance from the amount of the Company's current distribution. The amounts and sources of distributions set out above are estimates only and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions made in 2025 will be made after the year-ended 2025. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts of distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Company's results during the remainder of the calendar year and are subject to any changes to applicable tax regulations. Information for tax reporting purposes will be provided to the Company's shareholders on a Form T5 in February of 2026.
