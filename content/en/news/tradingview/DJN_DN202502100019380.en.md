U.S. President Trump's plans for new tariffs could introduce some volatility into bond markets, ING's rates strategists say in a note. "New tariffs threats, this time for metals, could bring some volatility," they say. Moves in bonds shouldn't be too large, however, as the news is unlikely to cause "a structural move higher or lower for rates." Trump said he plans to impose 25% tariffs Monday on imports of steel and aluminum. He also plans to make an announcement about reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday. The 10-year Bund yield falls 1 basis point to 2.370%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
