The holding of the Del Vecchio family, Delfin, is exploring the possibility of selling its 2.7% stake in UniCredit , the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing banking sources.

According to the daily, an assessment on the possible operation, which could be carried out via an accelerated book building and would be worth almost 2 billion euros ($2.06 billion), could be made as soon as on Wednesday or Thursday.

Delfin declined to comment.

UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel, in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday morning, described Delfin as an "excellent" long-term investor in the bank, "through thick and thin."

"I respect their decision. My job is to make it the wrong decision ex post facto if they are indeed considering to sell, because so far they haven't," Orcel said.

($1 = 0.9704 euros)
