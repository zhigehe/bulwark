Chip-card technology was supposed to cut down on fraud when it was rolled out in the mid-2010s. But roughly a decade of evidence shows that the tech has only enabled limited progress on fighting fraud, economist Fumiko Hayashi of the Kansas City Fed finds. Fraud rates on dual-message payment networks (such as Visa, Mastercard and Discover) have in general failed to decline, or have even increased, despite broad adoption of chip debit cards. (The research excludes prepaid debit cards.) Fraud trends are a bit better for single-message payment networks, which require the user to enter a PIN at the point of sale in addition to inserting the chip. Understanding why this has happened will require more research, Hayashi writes. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)
