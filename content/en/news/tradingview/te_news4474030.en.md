The Japanese yen held steady around 152 per dollar on Tuesday after dropping in the previous session, weighed down by the dollar’s strength following the latest US tariffs.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions," raising concerns about an inflation-driven global trade war.

This move could also limit the scope for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

Meanwhile, the yen surged over 2% last week, fueled by growing expectations that the Bank of Japan will continue raising rates this year.

On Thursday, BOJ board member Naoki Tamura stated that the central bank must increase the policy rate to at least 1% in the latter half of fiscal 2025.

Additionally, recent wage and household spending data exceeded forecasts, further strengthening the hawkish outlook on rates.
