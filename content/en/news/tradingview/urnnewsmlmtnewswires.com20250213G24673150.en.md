Chunghwa Precision Test Technology or CHPT (TWO:6510) expects minimal impact from Washington's tariff hikes as only a portion of its products ship directly to the US, Taipei Times reported.

In 2022, the chip testing service provider upgraded a unit in California and boosted capacity at a factory there to cope with demand for testing AI chips and smartphone processors.

To better serve its customers there, the company's board recently approved a plan to provide its North American business with more power and financial resources.

CHPT president Scott Huang said North America replaced Taiwan as the biggest revenue source for the company in 2024, comprising 60% of its total revenue versus 30% in 2023.

The company expects a strong first half, thanks to high factory utilization and continued AI-driven growth, the report said.
