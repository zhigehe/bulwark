The Australian dollar edges lower against its U.S. counterpart on fears of more global tariffs. The 'peak tariff' situation doesn't appear to have been reached yet, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Carol Kong says in a research report. "In particular, the U.S. and China's tariffs against each other can increase further before any trade deal can be struck," the economist and currency strategist says. Owing to its sensitivity to risk sentiment and Australia's high exposure to Chinese domestic demand, AUD/USD remains vulnerable to the downside, Kong adds. AUD/USD is 0.1% lower at 0.6269.
