EXTRACT OF COMMENTS FROM CEO, GRETHE BERGLY:Multiconsult delivered a good quarter with a very strong order intake. Thehighbilling ratio is a result of a high activity level in the organisation, and Iampleased with how our employees' competencies are in high demand from ourclients. Overall good operational performance and robust organic growththroughout the year ensure that we leave 2024 with a solid foundation goingforward. Reflecting on the accomplishments over the past year, I am filledwithpride and gratitude for the dedication and hard work contributed by each oneofour employees.

High sales activity has led to several successful contracts, resulting in thestrongest fourth-quarter order intake ever.  We maintain a strong anddiversified order backlog, as a sought-after partner we continue to buildstrategic positions within areas such as energy, water and environment, andhospitals.

The market remained stable throughout the quarter. A significant increase indefence investment has positively impacted our market position. While parts ofthe building and property market continued to struggle with low investmentlevels and budget cuts in both the public and private sectors, other marketareas continued at a good level.

In November, we launched our revised group strategy, Think Beyond. I ampleasedto see how all subsidiaries have responded positively and taken steps towardsits realisation. Enabling the green transition is a key element of thestrategy.We reaffirm our strong position towards energy transition by securing newframework agreement with Statkraft and a significant electrification contractwith Equinor. We have strengthened our position towards urban transformationanddevelopment through projects by LINK Arkitektur and A-lab.

Leaving 2024 behind, we can look back on five years of stable, strongperformance, proving that Multiconsult is on par with the best players in ourindustry. It fills me with pride to see the results we as an organisation haveachieved. Looking ahead, Multiconsult is in a strong position to navigate forfuture growth and support our clients' needs. Our solid order backlog, focusonsustainability, and growth in key areas position us well to seize futureopportunities. With our dedicated teams and strong foundation, I am confidentwewill continue to build on our success, prepared to take on the challenges tomaintain at the forefront - we are ready for "Think beyond"!

FINANCIAL REVIEW, FOURTH QUARTER 2024:

Net operating revenues amounted to NOK 1 443.3 million (1 361.5), an increaseof6.0 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. The organic revenuegrowthamounted to 4.8 per cent, adjusted for calendar effect and acquisition. Theincrease in net operating revenues was driven by increased capacity, higherbilling rates and higher billing ratio. The billing ratio exceeded last year'scomparable quarter by 0.7 percentage points, reaching 72.5 per cent (71.8).Higher capacity, reflected by an increase in full-time equivalents (FTE) of3.3per cent contributed positively.

Net project write-downs represent losses or gains in previously recordedrevenues, and may be caused by several factors, including project deliveriesnotaccording to agreements with clients or project estimates that needadjustment.Multiconsult's expected normal level of net project write-downs is below 1 percent of net operating revenues for the FY 2024, compared to 1-2 per cent fortheFY 2023. As operational performance and risk management have improved in 2024write-downs have been more evenly spread over the previous quarters, resultingin lower project write-ups/lower write-downs in the fourth quarter this year,compared to the fourth quarter in 2023, negatively impacting net operatingrevenues year-over-year.

Employee benefit expensesincreasedby 9.6 per cent compared to the same quarter in 2023. The increase is mainlyattributable to higher employee benefit expenses caused by ordinary salaryadjustment effective from 1 July, increased manning level from acquisitionsandnet recruitment. Other operating expenses increased by 8.5 per cent to NOK178.7million (164.7), primarily due to higher consultancy expenses, IT-cost andcostincrease in general.
