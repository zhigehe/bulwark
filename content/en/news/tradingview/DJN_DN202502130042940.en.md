European stocks open higher amid expectations of a truce in Ukraine after President Trump said he is ready to negotiate with Russia. Although it is unclear whether a truce in the conflict would lead to a removal of sanctions on Russia and improved energy supply for Europe, investors could see it as a logical next step, Barclays analysts say in a research note. This could lift sentiment on the energy intensive sectors and manufacturing plays, the bank says. DAX, Germany's index of blue chips, jumps 1% in early trade with Siemens, BASF and auto makers Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW among the biggest gainers. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up 0.90%, while France's CAC 40 climbs 0.87% and Switzerland's leading index rises 0.79%. (maitane.sardon@wsj.com)
