* Revenue was $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 and $2,373 million for the full-year 2024

David Cherechinsky, President and CEO of DNOW, added, "I am proud of the strong results we achieved in 2024, accentuated by $289 million in free cash flow, nearly twice our projections from last February. I am also pleased that fourth quarter EBITDA was markedly higher than expectations, at $45 million, or 7.9% of revenue, thanks to expanded gross margins and implemented cost control initiatives.

The recently announced $160 million share repurchase authorization, which is double in size from our previous program, demonstrates confidence in the strength of our business. This substantial increase signals our strong conviction in DNOW's cash generation capabilities and future earnings potential. Our commitment to maintain an acquisition focus alongside share buybacks provides multiple avenues for shareholder value creation.

I am honored to represent the talented women and men of DNOW who work creatively and enthusiastically to win in the market. Your determination and dedication give me great confidence in our bright future as we lay the groundwork for a successful 2025, a year that could mark the fifth consecutive year of growth for DNOW."

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose various non-GAAP financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures. The non-GAAP financial measures include: (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding other costs, (ii) EBITDA excluding other costs as a percentage of revenue, (iii) net income attributable to DNOW Inc. excluding other costs, (iv) diluted earnings per share attributable to DNOW Inc. stockholders excluding other costs, and (v) free cash flow. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and manage the Company's operations because we believe they provide useful supplemental information regarding the financial performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace the GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and the remaining non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain other items. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the schedules herein. Totals in the schedules herein may not foot due to rounding.
