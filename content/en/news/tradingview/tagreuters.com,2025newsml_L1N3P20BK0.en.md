South Korean flour mill CJ CheilJedang purchased about 30,000 tonnes of U.S.-origin milling wheat on Tuesday, European traders said.

The wheat was sought for shipment in April. A range of different wheat types was purchased, traders said.

Trading house CHS was believed to be the seller.

Traders said the purchase comprised 6,200 tons of soft white wheat of 9.5% to 11% protein content bought at about $238.6 a ton free on board (FOB).

Another 6,650 tons of hard red winter wheat of a minimum 11.5% protein was bought at around $251 a tonne FOB, and 17,150 tons of northern spring wheat of a minimum 14% protein content was purchased at $274.1 a ton FOB, traders said.

Korean mills last week made separate purchases of 85,000 tons of wheat from the U.S. and 30,000 tons from the U.S. and Canada.

Reports reflect assessments from traders and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.
