Chicago Board of Trade corn futures ticked higher on Monday as market players turned their focus to Tuesday's U.S. Department of Agriculture supply and demand report, where the agency is expected to report tighter U.S. corn ending stocks.

* CBOT March corn (CH25) settled up 4 cents to $4.91-1/2 per bushel.
* Corn futures also received a boost from signs of strong demand, including a hefty sale of corn to Mexico on Monday morning and export inspections of corn that came in on the high end of trade expectations.
* Showers forecast in Argentina this week may offer relief for corn and soy crops struggling with dry conditions.
* Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expect the USDA to cut U.S. corn ending stocks to 1.526 billion bushels from 1.540 billion bushels in January.
* U.S. President Donald Trump said he will impose punitive tariffs on aluminum and steel imports into the U.S., raising concern over potential retaliation against U.S. grain and oilseed exports, analysts said.
