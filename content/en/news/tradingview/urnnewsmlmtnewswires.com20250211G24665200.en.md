Aeon Co. unit Aeon Retail's all-store sales gained 1.8% year over year in January while same-store sales rose 2%, according to a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday.

From Jan. 1 to 5, the group held its New Year sales event, featuring over 900 activities at AEON MALLs nationwide.

During the month there was a surge in demand for cold remedies and antigen test kits, driven by a nationwide influenza outbreak, resulting in 35 consecutive months of increased same-store sales in the the Dispensing and Pharmacy segment.

The food segment continued to be robust in areas such as fresh produce, seafood, delicatessen, groceries, and dairy products, achieving 29 consecutive months of growth.
