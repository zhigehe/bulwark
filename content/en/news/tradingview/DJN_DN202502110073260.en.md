Carrier Global is positioning itself for a boom in data centers. The air-conditioning and building-automation company earlier this month introduced a suite of energy-efficient solutions, which executives on an earnings call Tuesday described as a one-stop shop for a data center's cooling needs. Carrier said it's looking at $1 billion in data center sales this year, which would approximately double from last year. Executives added that they see an opportunity for outsized growth in data centers in 2025 and beyond. Shares fall 1.5% to $65.26 as 4Q revenue growth came in below Wall Street's estimates.
