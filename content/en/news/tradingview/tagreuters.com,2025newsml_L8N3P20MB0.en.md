\*\* Shares in Barco jump around 15% to their highest since November after the Belgian visual technology company reported full-year earnings ahead of expectations and launched a share buyback

\*\* EBITDA for financial year 2024 stood at 120.8 million euros ($124.45 million), 16.8% above the LSEG-compiled consensus

\*\* KBC describes the results as "very good," with cash flow generation and buyback supporting the broker's PT of 13.2 euros

\*\* "Barco's guidance for FY 2025 is relatively OK and seems prudent on the top-line level," Degroof Petercam says, retaining its "hold" rating
