Hong Kong stocks fell on Tuesday after three consecutive sessions of gains as sentiment soured due to escalating US tariffs.

The Hang Seng Index slid 1.06%, or 227.12 points, to close at 21,294.86. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 1.31%, or 104.09 points, to end at 7,842.72.

Shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese automakers tumbled after US President Donald Trump hinted at import duties on cars, South China Morning Post reported.

Geely Automobile led decliners with an over 10% fall, followed by Great Wall Motor and Li Auto with a 7% and nearly 6% decline, respectively.

The development came a day after Washington announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, in addition to the 10% duty on Chinese goods.

The Trump administration may also announce reciprocal tariffs on countries that have imposed duties on imports from the US, according to the SCMP report.
