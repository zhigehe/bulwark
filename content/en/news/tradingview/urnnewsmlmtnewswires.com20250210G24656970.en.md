Katoro Gold conditionally raised 317,500 pounds sterling by placing new shares and agreed to purchase mining claims holder 31 Explore.

The minerals exploration and development company issued 635 million ordinary shares at 0.0005 pound each for the conditional equity financing, according to a Monday release.

The company will use the fundraising to fund exploration of the newly-acquired claims and at its White Pine uranium project in Ontario as well as for general working capital.

Katoro Gold also signed a heads of terms agreement to buy the UK-based mineral exploration project generator, which controls a 12,792-hectare portfolio of mining claims in Ontario, Canada, prospective for lithium-bearing pegmatites and rare-earth elements.

The company will issue 750 million acquisition warrants to 31 Explore's shareholders for the acquisition.
