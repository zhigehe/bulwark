Fitell unveiled a registered direct offering of about 2 million shares to an institutional investor at $5.02 per share, along with warrants to purchase up to about the same number of shares at an exercise price of $5.02, for gross proceeds of about $10 million.

Shares slumped 57% following a surge in intraday trading volume to over 1.7 million from a daily average of about 335,000.

Bill.com reported messy fiscal Q2 financial results amid a Q3 revenue guidance miss, but these pressures will likely ease in H2, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Friday.

Foreign exchange headwinds and seasonality led to a quarter-over-quarter decline in the company's take rate and year-over-year payment volume growth fell short of investor expectations, the analysts said in the note.

Shares sank 33%, with intraday trading volume catapulting to over 22.2 million versus a daily average of about 2.6 million.

e.l.f. Beauty slumped 19% amid heavy trading after the cosmetics company lowered late Thursday its fiscal 2025 outlook.

More than 20 million shares traded intraday compared with a daily average of about 2.2 million.
