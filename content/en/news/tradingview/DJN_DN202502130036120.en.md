The FTSE 100 is expected to open slightly higher after better-than-forecast U.K. economic growth data. The index is seen opening seven points higher, or 0.1%, according to IG. It closed up 30 points, or 0.3%, to 8807 points Wednesday. The economy grew 0.4% on month in December, beating the 0.1% forecast by economists in a WSJ survey. In the fourth quarter, the economy expanded 0.1% on quarter. "Given there was no growth in the previous quarter and a contraction had been expected, even minimal growth such as this is a positive," Quilter Investors strategist Lindsay James says in a note.
