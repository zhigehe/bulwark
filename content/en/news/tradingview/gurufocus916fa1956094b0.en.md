Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financials) is aligning its growth strategy with the anticipated demand for Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell GPUs, projecting revenue impacts by the quarter ending June 2025.

Expecting rapid development in new-generation platforms as supply rises, CEO Charles Liang highlighted the company's shift from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs. Depending on supply chain fit with demand, he expressed hope that 2025 will either reflect or exceed the increase seen in 2023.

For data centers, Super Micro combines Nvidia's GPUs into its server systems and provides direct liquid cooling solutions to improve energy economy. While noting that satisfying existing AI solution backlogs would take longer, partially owing to consumers having more time to finish their DLC data center build-outs, Liang underlined the start of volume shipments for both air-cooled and liquid-cooled NVIDIA B200 HGX systems.

Citing supply chain restrictions and internal operational issues, the business changed its full-year fiscal 2025 sales projection from the prior $26 billion to $23.5 billion to $25 billion.

Super Micro also wants to submit its quarterly reports for September and December 2024 in addition to its 2024 annual report by Feb. 25. Still, given continuous delays and an internal inquiry tied to prior accounting issues, reaching this goal seems doubtful.

Delayed filings brought on by claims of inappropriate accounting have presented difficulties for the corporation and resulted in an internal probe. Ignoring legal criteria runs a danger to its Nasdaq listing.
