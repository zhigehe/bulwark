The euro pares gains against the dollar as optimism over a Ukraine ceasefire deal fades, Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley says in a note. "What is glaringly obvious to European investors is the apparent absence of either Ukrainian or EU politicians in the arrangements that President Trump appears to be making towards bringing the conflict to an end," she says. There is also fears over Trump conceding too much to Russia and over coherence among NATO countries. The path to peace could prove a "messy process for Europe with outcomes that are not all euro positive." The euro rises 0.1% to $1.0398 after earlier hitting a one-week high of $1.0441, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
