Malaysia's current account surplus surged to MYR 11.42 billion in Q4 of 2024 after hitting a record low of MYR 0.91 billion in the same period of the previous year.

It was the largest value in a year, with goods account surplus widening sharply to MYR 37.38 billion from MYR 30.81 billion a year earlier.

At the same time, the services account deficit plunged to a tiny MYR 0.15 billion from MYR 7.39 billion, buoyed by solid rises in manufacturing services and travel, as well as improvement in other business services.

Meanwhile, the primary income shortfall narrowed slightly to MYR 20.15 billion from MYR 20.34 billion in the prior year.

However, the secondary income deficit climbed to MYR 5.66 billion from MYR 2.16 billion.

For the whole year, the current account surplus went up to MYR 32.78 billion from MYR 28.20 billion.
