Gold surged past $2,930 per ounce on Tuesday, hitting a new record high, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid mounting trade tensions and economic uncertainty.

President Donald Trump recently imposed sweeping tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US and signaled new reciprocal tariffs this week.

Geopolitical risks also grew as Hamas suspended the release of Israeli hostages, citing alleged Israeli ceasefire violations in Gaza, raising the risk of renewed conflict.

Meanwhile, expectations of looser monetary policy are supporting non-yielding gold.

Markets anticipate two Fed rate cuts in 2024, while the BoE and RBI have recently made dovish rate cuts, following similar moves by the ECB, Riksbank, and BoC. Additionally, central bank gold purchases continued to boost bullion, with the PBoC increasing its reserves for the third consecutive month in January.
