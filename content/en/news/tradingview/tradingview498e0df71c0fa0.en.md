Zoetis Inc., a leading animal health company, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company also provided guidance for the full year 2025. The report highlights the company's continued growth and strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining its market position.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Zoetis reported revenue of $2.3 billion, marking a 5% increase compared to the same period in 2023. The net income for the quarter was $581 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, reflecting an 11% increase in net income and a 13% increase in diluted EPS. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $632 million, or $1.40 per diluted share.

For the full year 2024, the company reported revenue of $9.3 billion, an 8% increase from 2023. Net income for the year was $2.5 billion, or $5.47 per diluted share, representing a 6% increase in net income and an 8% increase in diluted EPS. Adjusted net income for the year was $2.7 billion, or $5.92 per diluted share.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Zoetis' U.S. segment reported revenue of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, a 4% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by strong sales of companion animal products, including Simparica Trio®, Apoquel®, and Cytopoint®. However, sales of livestock products declined by 8% due to the divestiture of certain product portfolios.

Internationally, the company reported revenue of $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter, a 6% increase on a reported basis and a 10% increase operationally. Companion animal product sales grew by 11% on a reported basis and 13% operationally, driven by key dermatology products and monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Zoetis continues to expand its product portfolio and market reach. Recent product approvals include Revolution® Plus in Brazil and additional claims for Librela® and Simparica® in various markets. The company also completed the divestiture of its medicated feed additive product portfolio, which is expected to streamline operations and focus on core growth areas.

**Management's Perspective**

Kristin Peck, CEO of Zoetis, commented, "Zoetis delivered excellent full year results in 2024, driven by the demand for our innovative products and the strength of our key franchises. We achieved significant revenue milestones and are confident in our ability to sustain above-market growth in 2025 and beyond."

**Future Outlook**

For the full year 2025, Zoetis has provided revenue guidance of $9.225 billion to $9.375 billion, with diluted EPS expected to be between $5.70 and $5.80 on a reported basis, or $6.00 to $6.10 on an adjusted basis. The company anticipates delivering 6% to 8% organic operational growth in revenue.
