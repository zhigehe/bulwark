Shares of MGM Resorts International climbed 9%, to $37.45, in late trading after its casino business in China buoyed the company's fourth-quarter results.

The stock ended Wednesday's regular session having edged 0.3% higher, at $34.37. Shares are down 20% in the past year.

The Las Vegas-based hotel and casino operator's Chinese unit notched revenue of $1 billion during the recent quarter, up 4% from last year.

Overall revenue fell 1% to $4.35 billion but came in ahead of the $4.27 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet expected.

Profit fell to $157.4 million, or 52 cents a share, from $313.5 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings came in at 45 cents, ahead of the 32 cents that analysts modeled.

Chief Executive Bill Hornbuckle said the company has experienced strong demand so far in 2025, positioning the company well for growth. "December was our highest convention booking month on record, and in January we saw revenue growth in our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations as well as strong future bookings," he said.

Shares of rival Caesars Entertainment rose 3.1%, to $36.70, after the bell, following MGM's report.
