The BSE Sensex closed almost muted at 76,139 in a volatile session on Thursday, as profit booking in select heavyweights erased early gains.

While pharma, metal, and realty sectors outperformed, IT and FMCG lagged.

On the economic front,   
inflation in India cooled more than expected in January, but a hotter-than-anticipated January inflation print in the U.S. dashed market hopes of multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025.
