GrainCorp expects fiscal 2025 underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in the range of AU$270 million to AU$320 million, up from AU$268 million a year earlier, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

Underlying net profit after tax for the fiscal year is expected to range from AU$60 million to AU$95 million, compared with AU$77 million the previous year, the filing added.

Chief Executive Robert Spurway noted strong grain production in East Coast Australia, with record receivals in northern regions, but said southern areas, particularly Victoria, faced challenges.

GrainCorp's receivals have reached 11.9 million metric tons (mmt) to date, from 8.5 mmt in February 2024, the company said.

The company expects fiscal 2025 receivals of 13 mmt to 14 mmt and warned of margin compression due to strong global grain and oilseed supply and weaker demand.

GNC also said it intends to conduct an on-market share buyback of up to AU$50 million.

Shares of the company fell 7% in recent Thursday trade, earlier hitting a 52-week low.
