Cynata Therapeutics' lead asset, CYP-001, could see an upward revision in its pricing assumptions if the launch of Mesoblast's Ryoncil sets a high market precedent, according to a Feb.10 note by Euroz Hartleys.

Based on estimates, Ryoncil could be priced between $500,000 and over US$1 million per patient.

Given that Ryoncil is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, its pricing may influence similar treatments, including CYP-001, Euroz added.

Euroz Hartleys notes that while CYP-001, is unlikely to match Ryoncil's pricing, a price of $1 million per patient for Ryoncil could prompt an upward revision of CYP-001's current price estimate of $150,000 per patient.

It maintained CYP's speculative buy rating and $0.67 price target.
