World Liberty Financial, the crypto project backed by the Trump family, said Wednesday that the X account of one of its cofounders was compromised to promote a fake token bearing Barron Trump's name.

The X account of Zach Witkoff, a cofounder of World Liberty Financial, was compromised and a fake Barron meme was posted, according to a post from the project's official X account.

"Please do not engage. We are resolving the issue ASAP," the post said.

The episode marks the latest example of the scams rampant in the meme-coin space. Last month, the X account of Time Magazine was accessed by an unauthorized user to share a fraudulent post about its plan to introduce a meme coin.

President Trump's daughter Ivanka has also warned about the misuse of her name by a fake cryptocurrency.
