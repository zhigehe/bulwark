OTTAWA--Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday he would speak to other Western allies about plotting a "firm and clear" response to the U.S.'s 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum.

In Paris for a conference on artificial intelligence, Trudeau told reporters the levy on metals from Canada is "entirely unjustified," as steel and aluminum from Canada is shipped to the U.S. to be used in the production of military equipment, ships, vehicles and other manufactured goods.

Canada is the top seller of foreign steel and aluminum to the U.S.

"We will be working with the American administration over the coming weeks to highlight the negative impacts on Americans and Canadians of these unacceptable tariffs. And we will also be working with our international partners and friends," said Trudeau, who will is stepping down as prime minister next month.

"And if it comes to that, our response, of course, will be firm and clear."

Late Monday, President Trump said a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminum would take effect next month. Imports of aluminum and steel are at significantly elevated levels that threaten the national security of the U.S., according to proclamations issued by the White House.

The Canadian Steel Producers Association said a tariff targeting Canadian steel "is completely baseless and unwarranted," and said Ottawa "must retaliate immediately."

Jean Simard, the chief executive of the Aluminum Association of Canada, said the 25% tariff would be "so destructive" for U.S. industry "that it cannot last."

Canada last week won a temporary reprieve from the Trump administration on a 25% tariff on all nonenergy U.S.-bound exports, and on a 10% tariff on energy products shipped to the U.S. The Trump administration has said the broader tariff on Canada and Mexico is delayed pending progress on the two countries' efforts to fortify border security and deter fentanyl trafficking.
