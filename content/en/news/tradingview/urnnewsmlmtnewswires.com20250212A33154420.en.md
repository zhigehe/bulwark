AnaptysBio said Wednesday that a phase 2b trial of its investigational drug rosnilimab to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis achieved its primary and secondary endpoints.

The trial achieved its primary endpoint of a change from baseline for all three doses vs. placebo at week 12 and showed that the drug was safe and well-tolerated, the company said.
