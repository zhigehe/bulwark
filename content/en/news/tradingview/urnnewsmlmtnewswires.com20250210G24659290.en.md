Breville Group said the project to move its 120-volt production out of China is "in full swing" amid US President Donald Trump's plans to implement an incremental 10% tariff on products imported from China into the US, manufactured after Feb. 1 or arriving before March 7, according to a Tuesday filing with the Australian bourse.

About 40% of the group's purchases are exposed to the China-US trading pair, a separate filing showed. The company expects this exposure to fall to about 10% by January 2026, with further reductions in the second half of fiscal 2026.

BRG said it does not expect the tariff to impact its fiscal 2025 results.

Shares of the company fell nearly 2% in recent Tuesday trade.
