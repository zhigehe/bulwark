Intel (INTC, Financial) shares jumped 10% on Tuesday following a series of policy announcements from the Trump administration aimed at boosting domestic AI production. The new federal stance marks a clear shift away from Biden-era regulations focused on safeguarding consumers and workers from the potential risks of artificial intelligence and automated decision-making. President Trump signed Executive Order 14179, which calls for an action plan to foster AI innovation by reducing regulatory barriers and promoting U.S. leadership in AI technology.

The administration stressed the country's demand for minimal constraints in developing AI systems and chips and pledged to promote domestic manufacturing and innovation. A tech investor and former executive has also been appointed as the AI & Crypto Czar at the White House to lead policy developments. This may encourage state legislators to draft their own policies to fill any cracks left by the federal policy change. These steps, market analysts say, are regarded as a huge catalyst for the tech industry to influence investor sentiment and propel the surge of intel shares. This could change the competitive landscape of the AI industry in the United States.
