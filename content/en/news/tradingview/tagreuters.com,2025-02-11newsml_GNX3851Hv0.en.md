Charlotte, NC, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Gene Slade, CEO of Lead Ninja System and renowned sales training expert, will be in Charlotte, North Carolina, from February 13-22, 2025, offering exclusive training and consultation opportunities for HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical professionals and business owners in the region.

During his visit, Slade will conduct an intensive onsite training program at One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning of Charlotte from February 17-20. Additionally, he is making himself available for private consultations with local HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical companies and professionals during his extended stay in the area.

"Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to provide value and grow your business," says Slade, whose EGSPA framework has transformed sales outcomes for thousands of professionals across the country. "Our approach helps technicians and maintenance professionals turn routine service calls into meaningful customer relationships."

During his Charlotte visit, Slade is offering:

**Private Training Sessions:** Limited spots available for companies seeking customized, onsite training for their teams

**One-on-One Strategy Consultations**: Exclusive opportunities for business owners to discuss revenue growth strategies and sales optimization

**Industry Networking:** Select opportunities for professionals to connect with Slade and discuss industry best practices

Slade's training methodology has already proven successful across 40 states, with over 3,000 students reporting significant improvements in their sales performance. His approach is particularly valuable for maintenance technicians who may lack formal sales training but regularly interact with customers.

"Our goal isn't just to teach sales techniques; we're building a foundation for long-term business transformation," Slade explains. "When we work with HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical professionals, we're helping them develop systems and processes that will continue generating results long after our initial engagement ends."
