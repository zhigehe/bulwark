TAMPA, FLORIDA / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 / It can be hard to plan a Valentine's Day celebration for that special someone in your life. But Florida's countless beaches, state parks, mangroves, and other natural areas provide the perfect places for you and your sweetheart to get outdoors and discover wild Florida.

**Lovers Key**

Live Wildly, a non-profit working to advance conservation in Florida and beyond, has five recommendations for outdoor dates this Valentine's Day.

"These locations provide beautiful settings that will not only help you fall in love with each other, but also fall in love with wild Florida," said Lisa Shipley, CEO of Live Wildly. "From holding hands on secluded beaches to strolling through flower gardens, a day exploring nature is the perfect way to ask someone to ‘bee' your Valentine."

* **Pancakes in Paradise**
  
  **De Leon Springs State Park****:** Dubbed "Healing Waters," by Mayaca Indians who once inhabited the land, De Leon Springs State Park offers miles of hiking trails, bird watching, and swimming in natural spring water. Start your day with a unique breakfast at the Old Spanish Sugar Mill located inside the park, where you can make your own pancakes. Then, take a romantic paddleboat ride on the spring-fed waters. And be sure to visit "Old Methuselah," a huge bald cypress that is more than 500 years old.
* **Astronaut Adventure**
  
  **Canaveral National Seashore** **and** **Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge****:** These neighboring parks sit next to NASA's Kennedy Space Center and boast amazing views of the earth, sea, and sky. Take a morning cruise along Black Point Wildlife Drive — where you can see alligators, bobcats, and river otters - followed by a romantic afternoon walk along the beach. And you might even get the chance to see a NASA rocket launch, really making your heart soar!
* **For Lovers Only**
  
  **Lovers Key State Park****:** It is said that until a road was built in 1965 connecting the islands of this park, only lovers were willing to make the effort to get there by boat. And, thus, its name was born. Today you can access the park by car, but it remains true to its name as a perfect destination for couples. Enjoy a secluded beach day, followed by a sunset paddle through mangroves where you can see dolphins, manatees, osprey, and bald eagles. Finish the romantic outing with dinner at a nearby waterfront restaurant.
* **Garden Tidepool Oasis**
  
  **Washington Oaks Garden State Park****:** Wander alongside shimmering reflection ponds that wind through beautiful formal gardens full of azaleas, camellias, and birds of paradise. Enjoy a picnic lunch under majestic oaks, then head to the park's shoreline famous for its coquina rocks - limestone made from shell fragments - where you can explore tidal pools full of marine life.
* **Campers' Delight**
  
  **Anastasia State Park** is a great place for observing a wide array of wildlife, including manatees, sea turtles, osprey, and bald eagles. Start your date biking along the beach or hiking through ancient sand dunes. Pack your own lunch and eat under covered picnic tables near the ocean. And spend a romantic night camping in the park's beautiful maritime forest. If you hear soft music playing as you fall asleep, it might be love - or the sounds of concerts drifting over from the nearby Saint Augustine Amphitheatre.

"At Live Wildly, we believe people protect what they love," said Shipley. "That's why we encourage everyone to get outside this Valentine's Day and fall in love with wild Florida."
