Delivery Hero intends to repurchase 1 billion euros of outstanding convertible bonds due 2025,Â 2026, and 2027, according to a Thursday release.

The German food delivery company offered to buy back all of the 2025 and 2026 bonds and up to 350 million euros of the 2027 bonds. The outstanding bonds include 48.1 million euros of 2025 bonds, 593.5 million euros of 2026 bonds, and 875 million euros of 2027 bonds.

The buybacks, which are expected to optimize the company's capital structure, will be financed through the proceeds from the initial public offering of its unit Talabat (DFM:TALABAT) on the Dubai Financial Market.
