Siemens Healthineers' fiscal first-quarter earnings beat prompted mwb research to keep the stock at buy and lift its price target to 64 euros from 60 euros.

"With a good start to FY25, guidance for the current fiscal appears achievable. Management has highlighted that the order pipeline remains strong, which is reassuring. Moreover, except China, most regions are witnessing healthy demand trends," the research firm said Feb. 7.

Analysts also raised their sales, EBIT and EPS forecasts for the German healthcare imaging and diagnostics group for 2025 through 2027.
