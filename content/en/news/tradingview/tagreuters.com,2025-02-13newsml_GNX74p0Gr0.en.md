MCLEAN, Va., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Freddie Mac (OTCQB: FMCC) today released the results of its Primary Mortgage Market Survey® (PMMS®), showing the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) averaged 6.87%.

“The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage continued to inch down this week, reaching its lowest level thus far in 2025,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s Chief Economist. “Recent mortgage rate stability is benefitting potential buyers, as purchase demand is stronger than this time last year. This is an indication that a thaw in buyer activity could be on the horizon.”
