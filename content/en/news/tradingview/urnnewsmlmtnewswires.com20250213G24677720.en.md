China's central bank projected steady economic growth for the country in 2025, supported by stimulus efforts introduced late last year, Xinhua News reported Thursday,

Stimulus measures already boosted production, demand, and market sentiment, supporting ongoing recovery, the news agency said, citing a monetary policy report by the People's Bank of China.

The central bank said China will implement a more proactive fiscal policy alongside a moderately loose monetary policy, aiming to keep prices stable, according to the report.
