Checkit agreed to acquire software company Crimson Tide through an all-share merger valuing the latter at 6.5 million pounds.

Crimson Tide shareholders will receive six Checkit shares for each share held, resulting in a 26.8% stake in the combined entity, according to a Tuesday filing.

Automated monitoring platform company Checkit noted that the combination is expected to deliver significant cross-selling and upselling opportunities for both companies along with revenue and cost synergies.

The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter, subject to requisite conditions. Crimson Tide will be delisted from London's Alternative Investment Market after the merger.
