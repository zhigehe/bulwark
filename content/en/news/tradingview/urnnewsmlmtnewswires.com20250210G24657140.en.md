Kobe Steel's profit attributable to owners of the parent fell 6.3% to 102.8 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024, from 109.7 billion yen a year ago.

The steel manufacturer said basic earnings per share (EPS) declined to 260.58 yen from 277.83 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing last Friday.

Net sales edged up 0.6% to 1.884 trillion yen from 1.874 trillion yen a year earlier.

It forecasted attributable profit to grow 18.7% to 130.0 billion yen or 329.52 yen per share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.

In a separate filing the company raised its dividend forecast to align with its payout policy.

The company expects to pay a year-end dividend of 55 yen per share, from 45 yen per share initially, for the current fiscal year.
