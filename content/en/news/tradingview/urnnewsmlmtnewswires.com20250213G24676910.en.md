Mayur Resources said it received favorable revised engineering procurement and construction bids for its Central lime project in Papua New Guinea, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

The firm is nearing completion in offtake discussions with potential customers for the project, the filing added.

Original equipment manufacturers provided revised kiln designs and specifications with a nameplate production capacity of 800 tonnes per day, a 33% jump from the 600 tonnes per day initially laid out in its definitive feasibility study.

Additionally, the hydration plant capacity has been revised to 15 tonnes per hour, a 50% increase from the definitive feasibility study.

It also identified the opportunity to deploy solar energy to power the power station, which is expected to reduce fuel costs and improve expected earnings.
