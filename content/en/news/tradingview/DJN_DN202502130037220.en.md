By Elena Vardon

Barclays said it expects an increase in profitability this year as it reported better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter.

The British bank on Thursday posted a pretax profit of 1.66 billion pounds ($2.07 billion) for the three months ended Dec. 31, up from 110 million pounds a year prior when it booked hefty restructuring charges, and ahead of a 1.62 billion pound estimate taken from a company-compiled consensus.

The group's revenue came in at 6.96 billion pounds, beating expectations of 6.705 billion pounds and roughly split between fees and commissions and net interest income, the difference between what banks earn on loans and what they pay clients for deposits. Investment banking, an area where Barclays aims to grow and has significant presence in the U.S., largely contributed to the result with 2.61 billion pounds.

The bank guided for net interest income excluding the investment bank and head office of 12.2 billion pounds for 2025, growing on the 11.2 billion pounds it reported for 2024 as structural hedges it has placed to mitigate the impact of interest-rate cuts by the Bank of England continued to provide a tailwind.

Return on tangible equity--a key measure of profitability--is expected to improve to around 11% this year from the 10.5% return it posted for 2024.

Barclays also launched an up to 1 billion pound share buyback and declared a total dividend of 8.4 pence.
