WTI crude oil futures fell over 2% to hover below $71.8 per barrel on Wednesday, extending earlier declines after US President Trump stated he spoke with Russian President Putin, driving markets to speculate on lower risks to supply from the major exporter.

The US President stated that each delegation would start negotiations to end Russiaâ€™s war with Ukraine, which sparked a series of tariffs against Russian oil producers and tanker operators since conflict began in 2022.

In the meantime, new data showed that inventories of crude oil in the US soared by 4.1 million barrels last week, exceeding forecasts for a 3 million-barrel rise.

Lastly, another report showed a higher-than-expected increase in both headline and core consumer prices in the US, backing expectations of a hawkish Fed, and thus pressuring commodities priced in US dollars.
