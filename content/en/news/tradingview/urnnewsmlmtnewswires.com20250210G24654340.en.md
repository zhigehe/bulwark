Fitch on Feb. 7 held Belgium's long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating at AA-, with a negative outlook.

The affirmation is underpinned by Belgium's diversified and wealthy economy and its eurozone membership. Offsetting these factors are Belgium's very high and rising government debt and strained fiscal adjustment amid the current political and institutional background.

The negative outlook is based on the lack of certainty in the new government's ability to trim its deficit and stabilize debt.
