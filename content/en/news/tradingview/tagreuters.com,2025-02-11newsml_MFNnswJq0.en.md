Magnolia Bostad AB (publ) (the “Company” or “Magnolia Bostad”) announced on 23 January 2025 that it will redeem in full its senior unsecured floating rate bonds 2020/2025 with ISIN SE0014956454, senior unsecured floating rate bonds 2021/2025 with ISIN SE0015659636 and senior unsecured floating rate bonds 2022/2026 with ISIN SE0017565203 (the “Existing Bonds” and the “Early Redemption”).

The Early Redemption was conditional upon the successful issuance of new bonds as announced by the Company through a press release on 23 January 2025 (the “**New Bond Issue**”). The issue date for the New Bond Issue occurred today and the conditions for the Early Redemption have therefore been fulfilled. The Early Redemption is no longer conditional and will consequently occur on 20 February 2025. The redemption price together with accrued but unpaid interest up to and including 20 February 2025 will be paid to each person who is registered as owner of the relevant Existing Bonds in the debt register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB at the end of business on the record date 13 February 2025.
