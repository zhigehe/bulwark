Corn futures fell below $4.90 per bushel, retreating from a near one-year high of $4.97 on January 29, as concerns over potential trade disputes, which could weaken demand for U.S. farm products, overshadowed signs of tightening supply in the latest WASDE report.

The broader grain market faced pressure after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs that could trigger retaliatory actions against U.S. crops.

Meanwhile, the USDA left its 2024/25 U.S. corn outlook unchanged but raised the season-average farm price by 10 cents to $4.35 per bushel.

Global coarse grain production is projected 1.8 million tons lower at 1.492 billion tons due to yield cuts in Argentina, where heat and dryness have damaged early-planted corn, and Brazil, where slow second-crop planting is dampening output prospects.

Additionally, WASDE forecasts lower corn exports from Brazil, Ukraine, and South Africa, alongside reduced Chinese imports, contributing to a 3-million-ton decline in global ending stocks.
