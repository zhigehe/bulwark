Meyer Burger Technology and its subsidiary MBT Systems secured bondholder approval for proposed changes to the terms of two sets of convertible bonds.

The Swiss solar cells and modules manufacturer held separate meetings for the bonds, with 72% of the 2027 bondholders and 74% of the 2029 bondholders participating and voting in favor of the proposed changes, exceeding the required approval threshold, according to a Monday release.

The proposed changes include deferring interest payments and reducing the notice period for future meetings. The amendments for the bonds issued by MBT Systems and guaranteed by Meyer Burger Technology became effective on the same day as the filing.
