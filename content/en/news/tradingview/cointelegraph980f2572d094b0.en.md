Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) posted a fifth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $1.3 billion, with Ether-based ETPs seeing the largest inflows.

Ether ETPs accumulated 95% more inflows than Bitcoin ETPs in the past trading week, recording a massive $793 million of inflows, CoinShares reported on Feb. 10.

The spike in Ether ETP activity came as ETH tumbled below $2,700 on Feb. 6, leading to “significant buying-on-weakness,” CoinShares research director James Butterfill wrote.

The surge marked the first time for Ether ETPs to outperform Bitcoin ETPs by inflows in 2025, with similar instances occurring in late 2024.

**Bitcoin leads by YTD inflows**

In the past trading week, Bitcoin ETP inflows tumbled around 19% from inflows during the previous week, totaling $407 million.

Despite losing to Ether in weekly inflows, Bitcoin continues to lead overall with year-to-date inflows of nearly $6 billion — 505% higher than Ether’s YTD total.![CoinShares, Ethereum ETF, Bitcoin ETF](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:980f2572d094b-9106e84dfbc15445690b2766f22c3b26-resized.jpeg)

Weekly inflows to XRP ETPs also saw a notable increase last week, surging about 45% from $14.5 million to $21 million.

Solana ETPs surged 148% week-over-week, posting $11.2 million of inflows.

**Total crypto ETP AUM drops to $163 billion**

Despite crypto ETPs seeing the fifth consecutive week of inflows, the total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs tumbled to $163 billion last week, down about 4% from the previous week.

Total crypto ETP AUM is also down about 11% from its all-time-high of $181 billion set in late January, CoinShares’ Butterfill noted, adding that the drop is likely a result of recent price declines on the market.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saw the largest inflows among crypto ETPs last week, with $315 million pouring in.![CoinShares, Ethereum ETF, Bitcoin ETF](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:980f2572d094b-6fadd50d33042ca6de46da6bf60f9239-resized.jpeg)

Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund saw the largest outflows last week, totaling $217 million.
