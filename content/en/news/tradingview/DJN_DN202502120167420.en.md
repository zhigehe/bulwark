Asian currencies consolidate against the dollar in the morning session as traders digest mixed developments. The U.S. January CPI was stronger than expected, CBA's Kristina Clifton says, noting the USD Index has traded in a wide range. However, there's also been news that President Trump and Russian President Putin have agreed to begin negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, the senior economist and currency strategist adds. USD/KRW edges 0.1% higher to 1,453.60; USD/SGD is 0.1% lower at 1.3525; AUD/USD is little changed at 0.6282. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
