The Board of Directors of Stora Enso Oyj has decided to convene the Annual General Meeting to be held on Thursday 20**March 2025.**

Notice is given to the shareholders of Stora Enso Oyj ("Stora Enso" or the "Company") to the Annual General Meeting (the "AGM") to be held on Thursday 20 March 2025 at 4:00 p.m. Finnish time at Marina Congress Center, Katajanokanlaituri 6, FI-00160, Helsinki, Finland.

The event is not part of the AGM and will be held in Finnish with simultaneous translation into English. In connection with the event, shareholders can present questions to the Company's management, but the event will not be a forum for decision-making.

14. Election of Chair, Vice Chair and other members of the Board of Directors

The Shareholders' Nomination Board proposes to the AGM as announced on 12 December 2024 that of the current members of the Board of Directors, Håkan Buskhe, Helena Hedblom, Astrid Hermann, Kari Jordan, Christiane Kuehne, Richard Nilsson and Reima Rytsölä be re-elected members of the Board of Directors until the end of the following AGM and that Elena Scaltritti and Antti Vasara be elected new members of the Board of Directors for the same term of office.

Elisabeth Fleuriot has announced that she is not available for re-election to the Board of Directors.

The Shareholders' Nomination Board proposes that Kari Jordan be elected Chair and Håkan Buskhe be elected Vice Chair of the Board of Directors.

Elena Scaltritti, born in 1972, Italian citizen with an Executive MBA degree and a Bachelor of Science degree in Organic Chemistry, has extensive experience in the chemical and technology industries from various global companies focusing on innovation and sustainable development. Currently, since 2022, she is the Chief Commercial Officer of the Danish energy transition solutions company Topsoe. Previously, she served as the Executive Vice President (2019-2022), and held several other leadership roles, in the chemical company SONGWON (2011-2022). Elena Scaltritti is independent of the Company and of its shareholders. Currently, she does not own shares in Stora Enso.

Antti Vasara, born in 1965, Finnish citizen with a Doctor of Science (Technology) in Engineering Physics has extensive experience in the technology and telecommunications industries, from research and development to business leadership and innovation. Currently, since 2015, he is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Finnish technology research and development organisation VTT. Currently, he is also a member of the Supervisory Board of Ilmarinen (since 2024), the Board of Directors of Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (since 2018), the Board of Directors of Elisa (since 2017), and the Research and Innovation Council of Finland (since 2016).

Antti Vasara is independent of the Company and of its shareholders. Currently, he does not own shares in Stora Enso.

With regard to the selection procedure for the members of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Nomination Board recommends that shareholders take a position on the proposal as a whole at the AGM. This recommendation is based on the fact that at Stora Enso, in line with a good Nordic governance model, the Shareholders' Nomination Board is separate from the Board of Directors. The Shareholders' Nomination Board, in addition to ensuring that individual nominees for membership of the Board of Directors possess the required competences, is also responsible for making sure that the proposed Board of Directors as a whole has the best possible expertise and experience for the Company and that the composition of the Board of Directors also meets other requirements of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

All candidates and the evaluation regarding their independence have been presented on the Company's website at storaenso.com/agm.

The recommendation of the Financial and Audit Committee concerning the auditor election is available on the Company's website at storaenso.com/agm. The Financial and Audit Committee confirms that its recommendation on the election of the auditor is free from influence by any third party and that no clause as set out in Article 16, Section 6 of the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) restricting the choice by the AGM or the Company's free choice to propose an auditor for election has been imposed on the Company.

17. Resolution on the remuneration for the sustainability reporting assurer

The Board of Directors proposes to the AGM that the Board of Directors be authorised to decide on the repurchase of Stora Enso R shares as follows:

The amount of R shares to be repurchased based on this authorisation shall not exceed 2,000,000 R shares, which corresponds to approximately 0.25% of all shares and 0.33% of all R shares in the Company.

Own R shares may be repurchased primarily in order to use the shares as part of the Company's incentive and remuneration scheme. The repurchased R shares may be held for reissue, cancelled, or transferred further.

The Board of Directors decides on all other matters related to the repurchase of own R shares. The authorisation is effective until the beginning of the next AGM, however, no longer than until 31 July 2026 and it revokes the authorisation given by the AGM on 20 March 2024.

The amount of R shares to be issued based on this authorisation shall not exceed a total of 2,000,000 R shares, corresponding to approximately 0.25% of all shares and 0.33% of all R shares in the Company. The authorisation covers both the issuance of new R shares as well as the transfer of own R shares held by the Company.

The issuance of R shares may be carried out in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights for the purpose of using the R shares as part of the Company's incentive and remuneration scheme.

The Board of Directors shall decide on other terms and conditions of a share issue. The authorisation is effective until the beginning of the next AGM, however, no longer than until 31 July 2026 and it revokes the authorisation given by the AGM on 20 March 2024.

**21. Amendment of the Articles of Association**

4 §: The Board proposes to delete reference to Corporate Governance Policy from the article 4 as obsolete as the Company is required to publish Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to applicable law.

5 and 6 §: The Board proposes to delete reference to the Deputy CEO as unnecessary since the Company no longer has a Deputy CEO.

Title of section IV and 8 §: Stora Enso is required to appoint a sustainability reporting assurer following the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. The Board proposes to include this obligation and the term of office of the sustainability reporting assurer into the article 8, and amend the title of section IV of the Articles of Association accordingly. The Board also proposes that the terminology concerning the auditor be changed to reflect currently valid legislation.

11 §: The Board proposes to clarify the meeting place in case a General Meeting is held virtually pursuant to the current article 9 of the Articles of Association.

13 §: The Board proposes to amend article 13 so that the Annual General Meeting shall also decide, in addition to the items currently listed, on the adoption of the remuneration policy, when necessary, and on the adoption of the remuneration report, and that the numbering of the current sub-items 7-11 of article 13 be changed accordingly. The Board also proposes to amend article 13 by adding a reference to the remuneration of the sustainability reporting assurer and by adding a requirement to elect a sustainability reporting assurer.

The current and proposed new wordings of the above-mentioned articles of the Articles of Association are available on the Company's website at storaenso.com/agm.
