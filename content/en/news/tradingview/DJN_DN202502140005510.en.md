The Philippines central bank's reason for an easing pause is clear: it wants policy to be flexible amid trade uncertainties, HSBC economist Aris Dacanay says. "BSP isn't alone here," he says, with flexibility also a priority for Bank of Thailand at its last meeting. That's an asset in the event of sudden Fed rates repricing, and an easing pause supports the peso and mitigates the risk of FX-driven inflation, he adds. The hold implies that FX volatility remains a concern but currency worries could be eclipsed if domestic growth continues to underperform, he says. BSP may eventually cut more than the Fed to make the peso more competitive, and aid exports at a time when supply chains are shifting. HSBC expects BSP to resume cutting in June.
