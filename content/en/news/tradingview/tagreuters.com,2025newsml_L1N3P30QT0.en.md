Former Acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal has left the partnership of international law firm Hogan Lovells to join rival Milbank, the New York-founded firm said Wednesday.

Katyal will lead Milbank's appellate practice from Washington, the firm said. Katyal, whose corporate clients have included Google, Nvidia and Coinbase, has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to his new firm.

Katyal, a vocal critic of Republican President Donald Trump, represented Hawaii in the U.S. state's opposition to challenging the first Trump administration's travel ban that sought to block people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S.

He also worked with the state of Minnesota supporting its prosecution of Minneapolis police officers for the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

Hogan Lovells had no immediate comment on Katyal's departure.
