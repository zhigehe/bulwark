Nissan Motor's profit attributable to owners of the parent fell more than 98% to 5.15 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024, from 325.4 billion yen a year ago​ amid a drop in sales volume, increased sales incentives, and inflation.

The company said earnings per share dropped to 1.42 yen from 83.45 yen a year ago, according to a filing​ on Thursday.

Sales revenue declined 0.3% to 9.143 trillion yen from 9.171 trillion yen a year earlier​.

In a separate filing, Nissan Motor said after including approximately 100 billion yen in restructuring cots, it revised earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, but yet to make any projections on its attributable net income.

In another filing, Nissan Motor aims to cut fixed and variable costs by around 400 billion yen in fiscal year 2026.

This cost optimization will lower the automotive business breakeven point to 2.5 million units from 3.1 million. As a result, Nissan expects to achieve a stable operating margin of 4%.

For fiscal year 2024, Nissan forecasted a loss of 80 billion yen, or 22.31 yen per share, and net sales to decrease 1.5% to 12.50 trillion yen.

Nissan Motor's shares gained nearly 6% in morning trading Friday.
