The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 0.5% to 25,443 on Friday, as robust labor market data eased pressure on the Bank of Canada to extend monetary easing.

Credit-sensitive tech stocks led losses, with Shopify, CGI, and Celestica dropping 1.4%, 1.1% and 2.9%, respectively.

Railway operators Canadian Pacific and Canadian National also declined 1.6% and 1.6%, respectively, while the financial sector faced headwinds, with Brookfield down 1.1%.

Additionally, a lower-than-expected US unemployment rate gave the Federal Reserve leeway to delay further rate cuts, pressuring risk assets.

The TSX ended the week 0.4% lower, struggling to recover from an earlier plunge sparked by US tariffs, now postponed until March, although fears persist following President Trumpâ€™s announcement of impending reciprocal tariffs.
