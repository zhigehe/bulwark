The chief executive of Kelly Services intends to retire by the end of the year.

The staffing and talent services company said Thursday that Peter Quigley has informed the board of his decision to retire once his successor is appointed and an orderly transition is completed.

The board's compensation and talent management committee has started searching internally and externally for the next chief executive.

Quigley has been with Kelly for 22 years. He was appointed CEO in 2019 after having served in roles including general counsel and chief administrative officer.
