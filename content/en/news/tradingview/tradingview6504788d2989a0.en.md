Marriott International, a global leader in the hospitality industry, has released its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. The company, which operates over 9,300 properties across more than 30 brands in 144 countries, has shown significant growth and resilience in a competitive market.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Marriott reported a worldwide Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) increase of 5.0%, with a 4.1% growth in the U.S. & Canada and a 7.2% growth in international markets. The company's reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.63, while the adjusted diluted EPS was $2.45. Reported net income for the quarter totaled $455 million, with an adjusted net income of $686 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1,286 million, reflecting a 7% increase from the previous year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Marriott achieved record gross room additions of over 123,000 in 2024, resulting in a net room growth of 6.8% from year-end 2023. The company's worldwide development pipeline at the end of the year included nearly 3,800 properties and over 577,000 rooms. The company also returned over $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2024.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Marriott's development team signed a record number of new deals in 2024, with conversions representing more than one-third of room signings and over half of room additions. The company expanded its presence in the midscale segment with the opening of 28 Four Points Flex hotels across EMEA and APEC and introduced the City Express by Marriott brand in the U.S. & Canada. Additionally, Marriott strengthened its non-traditional offerings with partnerships in the outdoor lodging segment.
