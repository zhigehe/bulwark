CelcomDigi's 4Q core net profit could be sequentially flat, as rising synergies from merger cost savings could be offset by normalizing expenses and higher device costs, CIMB Securities analyst Foong Choong Chen says. Still, CIMB maintains a buy rating on the telco company as it offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.7%-5.6% over 2024-2026. The analyst also expects 4Q core net profit to be 12%-15% higher on the year, and notes that the company's prepaid subscriber base seems to be stabilizing on quarter, and network integration appears to be on track. CIMB keeps its target price at MYR4.20. Shares are unchanged at MYR3.78. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
