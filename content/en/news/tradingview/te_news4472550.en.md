The South African rand hovered around 18.5 per USD, declining for the first time in six sessions after the US froze all aid to South Africa, citing the country’s land-expropriation law and allegations of genocide against Israel.

The South African government condemned the move, saying it was based on misinformation.

After briefly reaching a two-week high last week, the rand struggled alongside other emerging-market currencies as investors moved toward safer assets.

Some support came from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s reaffirmation of a ZAR 900 billion infrastructure investment plan over the next three years, aimed at boosting economic growth.

On the monetary policy front, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25bps to 7.5%, marking its third consecutive reduction.

The move signaled a cautious approach to balancing low inflation with external economic risks.
