H&R REIT Reports Fourth Quarter 2024 Results

Canada NewsWire

TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2025

TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2025 /CNW/ - H&R Real Estate Investment Trust ("H&R" or "the REIT") is pleased to announce its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024.

Tom Hofstedter, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer said "We continue to successfully execute our strategic plan to reposition H&R to be a more simplified growth and income-oriented REIT focused on residential and industrial properties. Since the announcement of this plan, H&R completed the spin-off of the REIT's 27 enclosed shopping centres and sold ownership interests in 58 properties totaling approximately $5.3 billion. As a result of these sales, H&R's residential and industrial segments combined have grown from 35% of the total portfolio to 67% and geographically, our real estate assets in the United States have grown from 44% of the total portfolio to 70%. In 2024, properties sold together with properties under contract to be sold, totalled approximately $488.9 million."

Development Update

Canadian Properties under Development

In January 2024, development of two of the REIT's industrial properties, 1965 and 1925 Meadowvale Boulevard in Mississauga, ON reached practical completion and the properties were transferred from properties under development to investment properties. The properties are fully leased with annual contractual rental escalations; both leases commenced in February 2024 and will expire in May 2036 and March 2037, respectively. The REIT recognized a fair value increase of $19.3 million on these properties between the start of construction and practical completion.

In Q1 2024, H&R transferred 6900 Maritz Drive in Mississauga, ON from investment properties to properties under development. In January 2024, H&R received approval from the City of Mississauga to replace the existing 104,689 square foot office building on the property with a new 122,367 square foot industrial building. Demolition of the existing office building was completed in April 2024. The property will include sustainability elements such as EV charging stations and solar panel readiness and is targeted to achieve LEED Gold certification. Construction has commenced and practical completion is expected in Q2 2025. As at December 31, 2024, the total development budget for this property was approximately $43.6 million with costs remaining to complete the new building of approximately $9.1 million.

In Q3 2024, H&R transferred 53 & 55 Yonge Street in Toronto, ON from investment properties to properties under development. The buildings are fully vacant and demolition commenced in Q1 2025. H&R elected to demolish both buildings in order to reduce property operating costs. H&R will continue to advance the rezoning process for these properties, but does not have any plans to start re-developing these properties in the near future.

U.S. Properties under Development

In Q3 2024, Lantower West Love, a 413 residential rental unit property in Dallas, TX, reached practical completion and was transferred from properties under development to investment properties. The REIT recognized a fair value increase of $31.3 million (U.S. $23.2 million). The property was completed on budget with costs remaining to complete of $9.2 million (U.S. $6.4 million), and the stabilized yield on budgeted cost is expected to be 5.7%. As at December 31, 2024, there were 210 residential rental units leased, of which 198 residential rental units were occupied. As at February 4, 2025, there were 240 residential rental units leased, of which 225 residential rental units were occupied.

In Q4 2024, Lantower Midtown, a 350 residential rental unit property in Dallas, TX, reached practical completion and was transferred from properties under development to investment properties. The REIT recognized a fair value increase of $23.0 million (U.S. $16.0 million). The property was completed on budget with costs remaining to complete of approximately $10.6 million (U.S. $7.4 million), and the stabilized yield on budgeted cost is expected to be 5.7%. As at December 31, 2024, there were 120 residential rental units leased, of which 87 residential rental units were occupied. As at February 4, 2025, there were 160 residential rental units leased, of which 125 residential rental units were occupied.

Equity Accounted Investments

H&R has a 50% managing ownership interest in 560 & 600 Slate Drive, a 26.6 acre land site in Mississauga, ON, located next to Toronto Pearson International Airport and in close proximity to access points on the 410, 401 and 407 Highways. The partnership through which H&R owns its interest submitted a Site Plan Approval application in 2022 to develop two single storey industrial buildings totalling 309,727 square feet and 160,485 square feet, respectively. Both buildings have been designed with flexibility such that they can accommodate either single or multiple tenants. Both will include sustainability elements such as EV charging stations and solar panel readiness and are targeted to achieve LEED Gold certification. As at December 31, 2024, the total budget for 560 & 600 Slate Drive was approximately $66.3 million with costs remaining to complete of $27.2 million, all at H&R's ownership interest. In Q3 2024, H&R obtained an external appraisal and recognized a fair value increase of $8.4 million at H&R's ownership interest primarily due to strong industrial demand given the close proximity to the airport and access points to the three major highways. The yield on cost for the overall project is expected to be approximately 6.6% with completion expected in Q3 2025. H&R is the development and leasing manager for this project and expects to earn approximately $2.4 million in aggregate for these services over the development period of the project.

In February 2024, the REIT created Lantower Residential Real Estate Development Trust (No. 1) (the "REDT") which completed an initial public offering in April 2024. The REDT raised U.S. $52.0 million of equity capital from investors to acquire an interest in and fund the development of two residential development projects (the "REDT Projects") in Florida totalling 601 residential rental units. The REIT contributed the land to Lantower Residential REDT (No.1) JV LP ("REDT JV LP"), in exchange for a 29.1% ownership interest in the REDT JV LP. The REIT is accounting for its ownership interest in the REDT Projects as an equity accounted investment. H&R retains an option to acquire the REDT Projects, subject to approval by the investors of the REDT. H&R is earning a development fee of 4% of the total hard and soft costs of the REDT Projects (excluding land and financing costs) and is expecting to earn a 1% asset management fee on gross proceeds raised by the REDT. H&R will also be entitled to 20% of the distribution proceeds over and above its pro-rata share of the equity after investors receive an 8% internal rate of return and 30% after investors receive a 15% internal rate of return. As at December 31, 2024, the total budget for the REDT Projects was approximately $87.8 million (U.S. $61.0 million) with costs remaining to complete of $67.1 million (U.S. $46.6 million), all at H&R's ownership interest. The REDT Projects are expected to be completed in mid-2026.

Future Intensification

In January 2024, the Toronto East York Community Council approved H&R's official plan and zoning by-law amendment application at 69 Yonge Street to convert the existing heritage building from office use to 127 residential units. The approval facilitates adaptive reuse of the existing 15-storey building, while adding density through infilling the southeast corner of the building and adding 5 residential floors to the overall height. H&R is addressing the conditions outlined by the Toronto East York Community Council and anticipates that the zoning by-law amendment will come into effect by the end of Q1 2025.

In February 2024, following the final reading of the New Urban Plan, the City of Dorval enacted new by-laws and zoning regulations, amending the allowable density and permitted uses at 200 Bouchard Boulevard to include residential development.

In October 2024, H&R submitted rezoning applications to the City of Toronto for 53 & 55 Yonge St., 145 Wellington St. W., and 310 Front St. W., to remove the current approved replacement office density and instead replace the office area with residential uses, including some affordable housing. H&R submitted these new applications given the changes in the office market over the past few years including the rise of hybrid work and reduced demand for office space. H&R anticipates receiving approval for these applications in Q4 2025. Along with the changes proposed to 310 Front St. W., H&R also submitted a rezoning application to replace the existing 12-storey office building at 330 Front St W., with a 65-storey mixed use tower.

2024 Cash Distributions

H&R's cash distributions amounted to $0.72 per Unit during 2024 (2023 - $0.70 per Unit) which comprised: (i) monthly cash distributions in aggregate of $0.60 per Unit (2023 - $0.60 per Unit); and (ii) a special cash distribution of $0.12 per Unit, further described below (2023 - $0.10 per Unit).

For the year ended December 31, 2024, H&R's payout ratio as a percentage of Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO") (a non-GAAP ratio, refer to the "Non-GAAP Measures" section of this news release) was 75.5% (2023 - 63.0%).

2024 Taxation Consequences for Taxable Canadian Unitholders

H&R's cash distributions amounted to $0.72 per Unit during 2024 (including a $0.12 per Unit special cash distribution to unitholders of record on December 31, 2024). The REIT also made a special distribution to unitholders of record on December 31, 2024 of $0.60 per Unit payable in additional Units, which were immediately consolidated such that there was no change in the number of outstanding Units. The cash portion of the special distribution was intended to provide liquidity to unitholders to cover all or part of an income tax obligation that may arise from the additional taxable income being distributed via the special distribution. The amount of the special distribution payable in Units ($0.60 per Unit) will increase the adjusted cost basis of unitholders' consolidated Units.

Non--GAAP Measures

The audited consolidated financial statements of the REIT and related notes for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024 (the "REIT's Financial Statements") were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). However, H&R's management uses a number of measures, including NAV per Unit, FFO, AFFO, FFO and AFFO per basic and diluted Unit, payout ratio as a % of FFO, payout ratio as a % of AFFO, debt to total assets at the REIT's proportionate share, debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the REIT's proportionate share, Same--Property net operating income (cash basis) and the REIT's proportionate share, which do not have meanings recognized or standardized under IFRS or GAAP. These non--GAAP measures and non--GAAP ratios should not be construed as alternatives to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, H&R's method of calculating these supplemental non--GAAP measures and ratios may differ from the methods of other real estate investment trusts or other issuers, and accordingly may not be comparable. H&R uses these measures to better assess H&R's underlying performance and provides these additional measures so that investors may do the same.

For information on the most directly comparable GAAP measures, composition of the measures, a description of how the REIT uses these measures and an explanation of how these measures provide useful information to investors, refer to the "Non--GAAP Measures" section of the REIT's management's discussion and analysis as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024 available at www.hr--reit.com and on the REIT's profile on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.com, which is incorporated by reference into this news release.
