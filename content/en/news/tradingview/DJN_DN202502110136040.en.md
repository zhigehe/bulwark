Malaysia's economy likely grew 4.8% on year in 4Q 2024, according to the median estimate of five economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. That would compare with the 5.3% expansion seen in 3Q and be in line with the advance estimate of 4.8%. Malaysia's final 4Q GDP data is expected to confirm steady economic growth, DBS economists Taimur Baig and Chua Han Teng say in a note. The services and construction sectors likely maintained strong expansion, similar to 3Q, while manufacturing growth likely moderated, they reckon. The positive momentum from 4Q is expected to have extended into early 2025, the economists say. However, DBS says the 2025 outlook remains uncertain, with potential downside risks from rising geopolitical tensions affecting global trade policies. Final 4Q GDP data are due Friday.
