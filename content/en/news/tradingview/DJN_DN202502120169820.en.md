IRPC could incur more impairments on its investment in Ube Chemicals (Asia) following a THB500 million impairment in 4Q, UOB Kay Hian's Arsit Pamaranont says in a research report. In a recent conference call, management disclosed the possibility of further impairment on its investment, the analyst notes. The Thailand-listed integrated petrochemical company also plans to shut down certain unprofitable units this year, which could heighten market worries over additional impairments. The brokerage trims the stock's target price to THB1.25 from THB1.50. However, the bad news is already priced in, the brokerage says as it maintains a buy rating. Shares last quoted at THB1.03.
