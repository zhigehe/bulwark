ETF platform strongly outperforms AUM and volume targets for MDST

Westwood Engineered Beta partnership launches first two innovative ETFs

Westwood’s Board authorized an additional $5.0 million of share repurchases

DALLAS, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. today reported fourth quarter earnings. Significant items include:

* Investment strategies beating their primary benchmarks included LargeCap Value, Dividend Select, Multi-Asset Income, Intermediate Fixed Income, Credit Opportunities, Global Real Estate, MLP SMA and MLP High Conviction.
* Multi-Asset Income, Global Real Estate and MLP SMA all posted top quartile rankings in their peer universes.
* Westwood Salient Enhanced Midstream Income ETF (MDST) reached $73 million in assets by year-end amid strong trading volumes.
* Quarterly revenues totaled $25.6 million versus the third quarter’s $23.7 million and $23.2 million a year ago. Comprehensive income of $2.1 million compared with $0.1 million in the third quarter and $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.
* Annual comprehensive income included an after-tax charge of $2.7 million due to an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration from our 2022 Salient acquisition, reflecting increased revenues.
* Non-GAAP Economic Earnings of $3.4 million for the quarter compared with $1.1 million in the third quarter and $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.
* Westwood held $44.6 million in cash and liquid investments at December 31, 2024, down $3.7 million from September 30, 2024. Stockholders’ equity totaled $120.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and we continue to have no debt.
* Westwood's Board of Directors authorized the addition of $5.0 million to the previous share repurchase program, resulting in $5.5 million available for share repurchases.
* We declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, payable on April 1, 2025 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2025.

Brian Casey, Westwood’s CEO, commented, “We celebrated the second anniversary of the acquisition of Salient Partners’ asset management business and are very pleased to report that the strategic combination continues to exceed our expectations. Our enhanced capabilities in energy and real estate income strategies have broadened our product reach while improving our average fee rate. We successfully launched two innovative exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) within the Westwood Engineered Beta (“WEBs”) partnership that we formed with ETF industry veteran Ben Fulton. The WEBs Defined Volatility SPY ETF (DVSP) and the WEBs Defined Volatility QQQ ETF (DVQQ) are designed to provide a more stable investment experience across market conditions using a dynamic, rules-based strategy to adjust exposure to equity markets based on real-time volatility. We are working hard across our sales channels to inform advisors and strategists about the benefits of all of our new ETFs, including Westwood Salient Enhanced Midstream Income ETF (MDST) and Westwood Salient Enhanced Energy Income ETF (WEEI), and we are looking forward to gaining traction and scale. Lastly, our pipeline for our traditional business is much improved compared with last year and we anticipate healthy opportunities for 2025 and beyond.”

Revenues increased from the third quarter and 2023’s fourth quarter primarily due to higher average assets under management (“AUM”) and higher performance fees.

Firmwide assets under management and advisement totaled $17.6 billion, consisting of $16.6 billion in AUM and assets under advisement (“AUA”) of $1.0 billion.

Fourth quarter comprehensive income of $2.1 million compared to $0.1 million in the third quarter on higher revenues and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, partially offset by higher income taxes. Diluted EPS of $0.24 compared to $0.01 per share for the third quarter. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings were $3.4 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to the third quarter’s $1.1 million, or $0.13 per share.

Fourth quarter comprehensive income of $2.1 million compared to last year’s fourth quarter of $2.6 million following higher revenues, offset by changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and higher employee expenses driven by performance-related incentive compensation. Diluted EPS of $0.24 compared with $0.32 per share for 2023’s fourth quarter. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings of $3.4 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.34 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023.

2024 comprehensive income of $2.2 million compared to $9.5 million in 2023 on higher revenues and lower income taxes, offset by changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, higher employee expenses driven by higher performance-related incentive compensation, and life insurance proceeds received in 2023. Diluted EPS was $0.26 per share compared with $1.17 per share for 2023. Economic EPS of $0.82 compared with $2.26 in 2023.

Economic Earnings and Economic EPS are non-GAAP performance measures that are explained and reconciled with the most comparable GAAP numbers in the attached tables.

Reconciliation of Comprehensive Income Attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. to Economic Earnings

**(in thousands, except per share and share amounts)**

**(unaudited)**

As supplemental information, we are providing non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic Earnings and Economic EPS. We provide these measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, Comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. and earnings per share, which are reported on a GAAP basis. Our management and Board of Directors review Economic Earnings and Economic EPS to evaluate our ongoing performance, allocate resources, and review our dividend policy. We believe that these non-GAAP performance measures, while not substitutes for GAAP Comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. or earnings per share, are useful for management and investors when evaluating our underlying operating and financial performance and our available resources. We do not advocate that investors consider these non-GAAP measures without also considering financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We define Economic Earnings as Comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. plus non-cash equity-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and deferred taxes related to goodwill. Although depreciation on fixed assets is a non-cash expense, we do not add it back when calculating Economic Earnings because depreciation charges represent an allocation of the decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. Although gains and losses from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are non-cash, we do not add or subtract those back when calculating Economic Earnings because gains and losses on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are considered regular following an acquisition. In addition, we do not adjust Economic Earnings for tax deductions related to restricted stock expense or amortization of intangible assets. Economic EPS represents Economic Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
