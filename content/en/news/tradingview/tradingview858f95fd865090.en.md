**Net Loss:** The net loss for the year was $(38.5) million, compared to $(65.4) million in the prior year, highlighting a reduction in losses due to increased revenues and effective cost management.

**Business Highlights**

**Digital Solutions Portfolio:** Q2 offers a comprehensive suite of digital solutions, including digital banking, digital lending, relationship pricing, Q2 Innovation Studio, and Helix. These solutions are designed to transform how financial institutions engage with account holders and end users.

**Customer Base and Market Penetration:** As of December 31, 2024, Q2 had over 1,200 financial institution customers, including more than 40% of the top 100 U.S. banks and credit unions. The company continues to expand its market presence by leveraging its broad product portfolio and deep domain expertise.

**End-User Engagement:** In 2024, Q2's digital banking platform saw over 4 billion logins and facilitated more than $3.3 trillion in financial transactions, highlighting significant end-user engagement and transaction volume.

**SaaS Model:** Q2 primarily operates under a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, allowing customers to scale their use of Q2's solutions as they grow. This model supports the rapid addition of new services and digital channels.

**Innovation and Technology:** Q2's open technology platform, particularly through Q2 Innovation Studio, enables financial institutions to develop and integrate new financial services quickly, fostering a partnership ecosystem that enhances customer engagement and operational efficiency.

**Security and Compliance:** Q2's solutions are designed to comply with stringent security and technical regulations, providing multi-layered security controls to protect customer and end-user data.

**Geographical Performance:** Q2 serves a diverse range of financial institutions, from regional and community financial institutions to global enterprise banks, demonstrating its broad geographical reach and market penetration.

**Employee and Culture Initiatives:** Q2 emphasizes a mission-driven culture, focusing on employee engagement, diversity, and community involvement. In 2024, Q2 employees contributed over 23,000 hours of community service, and the company supported various nonprofit initiatives.

**Operational Infrastructure:** Q2 is migrating its digital banking platform solutions to third-party public cloud service providers to enhance scalability, security, and operational efficiency.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Strategic Initiatives:** Q2 Holdings is actively leveraging its broad product portfolio and deep domain expertise to expand its market presence, particularly in the digital banking market. This strategy includes further penetration into the financial services sector and opening new expansion opportunities. The company has continuously invested in expanding and improving its digital banking platform and intends to continue investing organically and selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in technologies to strengthen and expand its solutions.

**Capital Management:** The company has financed its operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of common stock, convertible note offerings, and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2024, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $446.6 million. The company also has a $125.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement available for additional liquidity. The company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.

**Future Outlook:** Q2 Holdings plans to continue its investments in technology innovation and software development to enhance existing solutions and expand its product portfolio. It intends to grow its services and delivery organization to support customer needs and maintain its strong reputation. The company expects to increase its operating expenses in absolute dollars to support anticipated growth but aims to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenues over the long term as it realizes cost efficiencies. The company also plans to continue hiring new employees and making other investments to support its growth.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Security Threats:** The company faces significant risks from security threats, including cyber-attacks and data breaches, which could harm its reputation and result in financial losses. The reliance on third-party providers for data centers and cloud services increases vulnerability to disruptions and security incidents. Additionally, the integration of solutions with third-party systems poses risks if these systems experience outages or security breaches.

**Economic Environment:** The current economic environment, characterized by inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties, could adversely affect demand for the company's solutions. The financial services industry, which is the primary market for the company's products, is experiencing consolidation and increased competition from non-traditional financial service providers, which could impact the company's growth and profitability.

**Operational Challenges:** Managing growth effectively, particularly as the company expands its customer base and enters new markets, presents operational challenges. The unpredictability of the sales cycle and the complexity of customer implementations could lead to delays in revenue recognition and increased costs.

**Regulatory Risks:** Regulatory risks are heightened by evolving regulations related to data security, privacy, and the use of AI. The company must comply with these regulations, which could entail significant costs and impact its ability to incorporate AI into its solutions.

**Market Risks:** The company is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact its financial performance. The reliance on international operations introduces additional risks related to currency exchange and compliance with foreign regulations.
