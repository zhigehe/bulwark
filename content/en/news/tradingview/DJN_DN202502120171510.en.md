Iron ore edges lower in early Asian trading. Traders are closely watching a tropical cyclone that may affect Australian port operations, ANZ research analysts say in a note. Cyclone Zelia is expected to strengthen as it moves toward Western Australia's Pilbara coast, the analysts note. Still, Nanhua Futures analysts say the impact is expected and unlikely to inflict long-term damage to supply. Iron ore fundamentals continue to look good, they say. The most-traded iron-ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is down 0.2% at CNY819.0/ton. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)
