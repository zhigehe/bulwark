The Australian Banking Association has committed to keeping more branches open in regional areas and securing ongoing access to services through Bank@Post despite a significant decline in branch interactions in recent years, according to a Tuesday statement from the group.

AMP , ANZ Group Holdings , Bank of Queensland , Bendigo and Adelaide Bank , Commonwealth Bank of Australia , Macquarie Group , National Australia Bank , Suncorp , and Westpac Banking are part of the association.

The decision is aimed at ensuring continued banking services for customers in rural and remote locations who still prefer face-to-face banking, the group said.

Australian banks have now extended the moratorium on branch closures until mid-2027, while CBA, NAB, and Westpac secured new agreements with Bank@Post to maintain essential services, the group added.

ANZ is nearing a deal to offer Bank@Post access from October 2025, while Macquarie and HSBC are starting negotiations with Australia Post to expand services.
