By Heather Gillers

California will collect $1 billion in special fees from insurance companies to make sure it can pay out Los Angeles fire claims filed with the Fair Plan, California's insurer of last resort, the state insurance commissioner said. The companies are permitted to pass on half that amount to their own policy holders under a rules change approved last year.

The Fair Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, sells fire-damage policies to homeowners who can't get coverage elsewhere. Its business ballooned after private insurers pulled back from the state, gearing up for a disaster by not renewing policies as their risk models warned of likely conflagrations.

The Fair Plan's charge on each company would be roughly proportionate to its share of the home-insurance market. The largest home insurers include State Farm, Farmers Insurance, Allstate and Mercury Insurance.
