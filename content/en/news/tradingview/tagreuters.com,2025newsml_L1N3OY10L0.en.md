\*\* Reinsurance Group of America shares drop 9.5% to $208.67, on track for biggest daily pct drop since lat Nov. 2021, after hitting roughly 6-week low of $206.13

\*\* The insurance holding company reported Q4 earnings after the close on Thursday that fell short of Street expectations

\*\* Stock now on track to close below both 50-day and 200-day moving averages for the first time since Dec. 20

\*\* Jefferies analyst Suneet Kamath said RGA "appears to be signaling continued elevated capital deployment," but, "EPS missed 4Q:24 EPS expectations, and RGA's new outlook does not suggest material positive EPS revisions" although the firm feels RGA's long-term growth prospects are likely better than they have been historically

\*\* Of the 13 analysts that cover RGA, the breakdown of recommendations are 10 "strong buy" or "buy" and 3 "hold" ratings

\*\* Median price target of $252 is unchanged from a month ago and up from $247.50 on Nov. 7

\*\* RGA shares now down ~2% YTD vs ~6% gain in S&P 400 industrials (.SPMDCF)
