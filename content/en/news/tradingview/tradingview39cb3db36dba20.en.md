Antero Resources Corporation, an independent natural gas and natural gas liquids company, has released its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company also provided updates on its year-end reserves and guidance for 2025.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Antero Resources reported a net income of $150 million and an adjusted net income of $181 million. The company achieved an adjusted EBITDAX of $332 million, with net cash provided by operating activities amounting to $278 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $159 million.

Net production averaged 3.4 Bcfe/d, with natural gas production at 2.1 Bcf/d, a 7% decrease from the previous year, and liquids production at 217 MBbl/d, a 14% increase. The company realized a pre-hedge natural gas equivalent price of $3.64 per Mcfe, an $0.85 per Mcfe premium to NYMEX, and a pre-hedge C3+ NGL price of $44.29 per barrel, a $3.09 per barrel premium to Mont Belvieu.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Throughout 2024, Antero Resources maintained a net production average of 3.4 Bcfe/d, marking a 1% increase from the prior year. The company’s drilling and completion capital was $620 million, a 32% decline from the previous year. Estimated proved reserves at year-end 2024 were 17.9 Tcfe, with proved developed reserves at 13.7 Tcfe, representing 77% of the total proved reserves.

In the fourth quarter, Antero placed five horizontal Marcellus wells to sales, with an average lateral length of 17,950 feet. These wells have been online for approximately 60 days, averaging 34 MMcfe/d per well, including 1,650 Bbl/d of liquids per well.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

For 2025, Antero Resources has raised its maintenance production targets by 50 MMcfe/d to a range of 3.35 to 3.45 Bcfe/d, driven by growth in liquids production. The company has also reduced its drilling and completion capital budget by $25 million at the midpoint, setting it between $650 million and $700 million.

Antero added new natural gas hedges for 2025 and 2026, tied to the completion of two lean drilled but uncompleted (DUC) pads deferred in 2024. The company expects to turn-to-sales the first DUC pad in Q1 2025 and the second in Q3 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Paul Rady, Chairman, CEO, and President of Antero Resources, highlighted the company's exceptional performance in 2024, noting that production exceeded the midpoint of initial guidance by 2%, while capital expenditures were 8% below the midpoint. Michael Kennedy, CFO, emphasized the company's peer-leading free cash flow breakeven level, driven by significant liquids production and a firm transportation portfolio.

**Future Outlook**

For 2025, Antero Resources projects net production to average between 3.35 and 3.45 Bcfe/d. The company expects realized natural gas prices to average a premium of $0.10 to $0.20 per Mcf to NYMEX and realized C3+ NGL prices to average a premium of $1.50 to $2.50 per barrel to Mont Belvieu. The total E&P capital budget is set between $725 million and $800 million.
