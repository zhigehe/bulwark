There are some economists that continue to warn that a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week would amount to a bad policy error. Warren Hogan at Judo Bank is key among them, arguing that a consumer recovery is well underway, while business conditions have improved. PMI readings are also rising while input prices for firms are rising, he says. Meanwhile, credit growth is improving, while the Australian dollar is weak. The RBA should be cautious over the months ahead, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
