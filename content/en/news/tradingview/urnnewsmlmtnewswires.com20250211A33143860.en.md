LEEF Brands (LEEF.CN), a cannabis company, on Tuesday said it completed substantial increases in production capacity across its concentrate lines to address increasing market demand.

The company expanded ethanol extraction capacity by 66%, solventless extraction capacity by 50% and hydrocarbon extraction capacity by 38%.

"Our production expansion reflects the robust market appetite for high-quality cannabis concentrates," said LEEF Chief Executive Micah Anderson. "By increasing our extraction capabilities across all three lines, we're positioning ourselves to meet the diverse needs of California's cannabis consumers."

The company has also secured its 2025 cultivation licenses from the California Department of Cannabis Control for Salisbury Canyon Ranch.

LEEF expects increases in revenue and margins this year increases with the increases in extraction capacity, and the planting of Salisbury Canyon Ranch.

Shares of the company closed up $0.005 or 2.4%, to $0.215 on Monday on the Canadian Securities Exchange.
