Nomura Holdings' net income attributable to shareholders rose 146% to 268.8 billion yen in the fiscal nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from 109.1 billion yen a year ago driven by higher revenues across all three segments and cost controls.

The financial services group's earnings per share rose to 87.66 yen from 34.69 yen a year ago, according to a filing on Monday.

Net revenue increased 28.9% to nearly 1.440 trillion yen from 1.117 trillion yen a year earlier.

Nomura did not present earnings forecasts due to uncertainties in the global capital markets. The company also did not present a dividend forecast for the fourth quarter ending March 31.

The company expects to pay a commemorative dividend of 10.00 yen per share for the current year for its 100th anniversary.
