Kinaxis , a supply chain company, on Thursday said it has entered into a settlement agreement with Blue Yonder Group, to "fully resolve" all pending litigation matters between the companies which includes Blue Yonder's patent infringement claims and Kinaxis' trade secret misappropriation counterclaims.

In Dec. 2020, Blue Yonder filed a lawsuit alleging Kinaxis' infringement of six of its patents covering supply chain management technologies. Kinaxis countersued, alleging Blue Yonder had misappropriated certain of Kinaxis' trade secrets.

The terms of the settlement are confidential.
