The Australian dollar erased its early gains to trade near the $0.626 on Wednesday, trimming the eight week high touched earlier in the session after hotter-than-expected inflation data from the US backed hawkish expectations for the Fed and delivered broad pressure on G10 currencies.

Conversely, markets continued to position for an incoming rate cut by the RBA amid evidence that domestic underlying inflation will converge toward target.

Additionally, lingering concerns of protectionism and trade wars stemmed by tariffs by the US government also kept doubts on Australian assets due to the countryâ€™s dependence on commodity exports.
