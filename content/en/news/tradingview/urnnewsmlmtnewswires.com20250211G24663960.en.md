AlphaValue/Baader Europe downgraded Pernod Ricard to add from buy, with a price target of 125 euros, saying its "comeback has been delayed" due to a combination of lower sales, higher costs and a lack of midterm guidance.

The research firm on Tuesday also downwardly revised its EPS forecasts for fiscal 2025 and 2026 by 2.96% and 9.31%, respectively, as the French wine and spirits group faces macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and slower-than-expected growth. Meanwhile, its EBITDA projection was cut by 4.5% for fiscal 2026.

"Furthermore, due to the ongoing market uncertainties and the potential impact of a tariff war, we have adjusted our long-term EBITDA growth rate from 5.0% to 4.0%, in line with the company's revised organic growth expectations; this is amongst the only information provided by Pernod Ricard," analysts said.
