Rising power prices and increasing outages are electrifying demand for Generac's home standby and portable generators. Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld said 2024 had the most power outages since 2010 largely due to natural disasters. At the same time, demand to power artificial intelligence is surging and the transition to lower carbon sources is making power supplies less reliable. All this is likely to drive up electricity prices significantly. "We believe homeowners and businesses will begin to invest more aggressively in solutions to help them reduce their electric bills and improve resiliency," said Jagdfeld. The stock rose 9%, to $154.31, Wednesday. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)
