Volumes traded in CBOT grain futures have been light ahead of tomorrow's WASDE report from the USDA. But grain traders are not expecting much in the way of changes to the U.S. supply and demand picture, keeping positioning subdued. "Tomorrow's report should be a yawner," says Linda Meyer of AgriSource. "Should see some upward revisions in corn exports and possibly ethanol." Traders are maintaining a risk-off approach toward the WASDE, with other factors — like President Trump's tariff threats on major trading partners — are adding to the desire to curb risk. Most-active corn futures are up 0.8%, soybeans are down 0.1%, and wheat falls 0.8%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
