Morgan Stanley believes the uncertainty over the lingering threat of United States trade tariffs is crimping Canadian business activities to some degree to date although the bank hasn't made a fundamental revision to its outlook.

Morgan Stanley's foreign exchange strategists believe the lingering uncertainty will weigh on the value of the Canadian dollar (CAD or loonie), making the tradeoffs for the Bank of Canada more complicated than before.

The scope to ease to offset real-side weakness is reduced because of the inflationary effects of the weaker currency, state the bank.

Because the Canadian economy depends greatly on exports to the U.S., the actual implementation of tariffs would weigh significantly here, as well, added Morgan Stanley.

With businesses facing lower profits and possible layoffs leading to decreased consumer spending and business

investment pushing the economy into recession.
