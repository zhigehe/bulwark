It's highly likely that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will cut the official cash rate by 50 basis points to 3.75% at its policy meeting next week but project a slower pace of easing after February, says Westpac economist Kelly Eckhold. Still, there's also an outside chance the RBNZ cuts the OCR by more to try and bring the OCR to neutral more quickly, he says. There's potential for the RBNZ to outline a dovish scenario that signals its intention to move the OCR to neutral more quickly by signalling a 3% OCR by mid-2025. This would signal a high chance of a further 50 basis point cut at the April review, Eckhold says. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
