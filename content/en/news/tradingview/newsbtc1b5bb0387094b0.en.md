After the recent crypto market corrections, some investor’s and market watchers’ bullish sentiment appears to have decreased, with many claiming the top is in. However, other analysts point out that several indicators don’t signal a cycle peak yet, suggesting that the bull still has some gas in its tank.

**Crypto Market Capitalization Retests Key Level**

The crypto market has recently suffered continuous corrections that have halted the momentum from the post-US election. During the November-December rally, the industry achieved many milestones, including Bitcoin’s breakout from the $100,000 barrier for the first time in history.

The crypto market also surpassed its 2021 all-time high (ATH), reaching a market capitalization of $3.73 trillion on December 17, 2024. Nonetheless, its recent shakeout sent the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) to its lowest range in nearly three months.

On Monday, the market retraced to the $2.8 trillion mark, briefly losing the key $3 trillion support level before bouncing. Market observer Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the TOTAL chart retested the 2021 ATH during the pullback, turning the weekly candle “into a pretty interesting one.”

The trader explained that the $3 trillion mark is crucial to hold going forward despite the chart showing “plenty of demand for the time being.” Meanwhile, the $3.7 trillion mark remains the key resistance level, as it is “what’s in the way of further expansion higher.”

Daan also noted that the Altcoins market capitalization, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, swept the 2024 highs and bounced after briefly losing its current range during the market correction, which could suggest that the long-awaited altseason is still ahead.

He pointed out that Altcoins might continue moving sideways within their current range, but a breakout could see them test the December highs, as they are yet to break their 2021 ATH properly.

**Cycle Top Coming In Q4?**

Analyst Sjuul from AltcryptoGems shared an analysis of the total crypto market chart. The analyst stated that he doesn’t see the “warning signs” other investors and market watchers have mentioned online.

From a technical perspective, the crypto market’s rally is a “straightforward support and resistance situation” since flipping the 2021 ATH level, which the market is currently holding.

Sjuul compared this cycle to the previous one, stating that it technically is the beginning of the “real bull run.” Timewise, the chart presents various similarities between the two cycles, suggesting the top is around 230 days away.

He explains that the 2021 breakout from the previous cycle’s top occurred 1,120 days from the 2017 ATH. Additionally, the 2021 cycle top occurred 1,400 days after the 2017 peak.

Meanwhile, this cycle’s breakout from the 2021 ATH happened approximately 1,120 days after the top, similar to the last cycle. If history repeats itself, this cycle’s timing suggests that the crypto market top is around 7-9 months away.

Ultimately, the analyst projected the market peak to occur in Q4 2025 and potentially hit a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion.
