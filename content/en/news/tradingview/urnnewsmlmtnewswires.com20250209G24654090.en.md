New Zealand shares were flat with a negative bias Monday as US President Donald Trump threatened further tariffs.

The S&P/NZX 50 Index was little changed at 12,876.35.

Industrial services were the biggest decliners, while non-energy minerals led stocks that advanced.

In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.4%, the Shanghai SSE rose 0.3%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 was flat.

Trump said Sunday that a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports will take effect Monday. He also threatened further duties in the coming days in the event a country retaliates.

In domestic news, New Zealand's total new lending went up to NZ$13.8 billion in December 2024 from NZ$13.6 billion in the prior month, data from the Reserve Bank showed Monday.

In corporate news, the Environment Court has approved Meridian Energy's 120-megawatt Ruakaka solar farm in Northland following an appeal. The utility company's shares finished flat.
