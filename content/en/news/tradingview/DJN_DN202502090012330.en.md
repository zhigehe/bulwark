China's latest PPI data does little to improve the outlook for producer prices. The producer price index remained in contraction for a 28th consecutive month in January, declining on year and missing both market and Barclays economists' expectations. Declines were observed across the key segments, including mining, raw materials and manufacturing, the economists note. On an on-month basis, the PPI fell for a second straight month after a brief increase, weighed down by softer industrial demand during the Lunar New Year holiday season. The economists don't expect a rebound anytime soon, projecting that the PPI will stay in deflation throughout 2025. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
