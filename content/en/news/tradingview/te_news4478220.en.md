Malaysian palm oil futures extended their recent rally to MYR 4,660 per tonne in February, the highest in two months amid persistent concerns of lower supply and high prices for other biofuel feedstock.

Palm oil output from Malaysia wank by 17% from the earlier month to 1.24 million tonnes in January, the sharpest decline since 2016 to the lowest level since April 2023.

The slump took place as heavy rains in key states of Sarawak and Sabah resulted in floods and landslides, also backing concerns that lower output will persist in February.

This was enough to offset the impact of lower prices for alternative vegetable oils, which raises competition between major suppliers in Southeast Asia.

Earlier, palm oil prices were also supported by the Indonesian government tightening regulations on palm cultivation permits to aid local smallholder growers, but risking lower output from major manufacturers.
