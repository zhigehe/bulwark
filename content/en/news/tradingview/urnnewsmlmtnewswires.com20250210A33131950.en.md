Crude oil prices have fallen back to levels seen at the start of 2025 despite U.S. President Donald Trump's recent announcement of "maximum pressure" against Iran, Commerzbank said in a Friday note.

Most market participants are therefore assuming that Trump only wants to create a threatening scenario and is ultimately seeking a deal, the bank noted.

With the three major energy agencies reporting supply and demand assessments in the coming week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration's new estimates for U.S. oil production are of particular interest, according to Commerzbank.

The EIA in January said it expected daily U.S. crude production to remain at around 13.5 million barrels until the end of 2026. The bank does not expect any major adjustments to that forecast.

Though Trump is making efforts to improve drilling opportunities, a projected decline in crude oil prices is having a dampening effect, the bank said. This stems from a risk of oversupply on the oil market starting in spring.

The International Energy Agency also forecast an oversupply, but starting as soon as the first quarter. Even with the IEA warning that sanctions against Iran could tighten the market, a recovery in oil prices is unlikely to materialize for the time being, Commerzbank said.
