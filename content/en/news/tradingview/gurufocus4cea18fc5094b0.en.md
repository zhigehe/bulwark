Nvidia was added to Evercore ISI's Tactical Outperform list on Monday as analysts turned bullish ahead of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report on February 26. Shares rose slightly in premarket trading. Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis said Nvidia's recent underperformance lagging the S&P 500 by 9% over the past month was due to investor concerns about DeepSeek lowering AI demand, shifting workloads away from Nvidia GPUs, and potential delays in Nvidia's Blackwell chips.

However, Lipacis downplayed these fears, arguing that DeepSeek's lower cost is an evolution, not a disruption, and that AI demand should continue to rise. He also reaffirmed Nvidia as the top choice for hyperscalers, saying the company is five to ten years ahead of competitors.

While AMD and Amazon Web Services remain key players, Lipacis sees Nvidia dominating cloud and enterprise AI workloads, with internal workloads eventually splitting 50-50 or 70-30 in Nvidia's favor.
