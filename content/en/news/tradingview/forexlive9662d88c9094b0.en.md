BRC like-for-like sales is a metric reported by the British Retail Consortium to measure changes in retail sales, excluding the impact of new store openings or closures.

* It reflects sales performance only from stores that have been open for at least a year, providing a clearer view of underlying trends in consumer spending without distortions from changes in retail floorspace. This metric is widely used to assess how well retailers are performing in comparable, established locations, making it a reliable indicator of real growth or decline in sales.
