The DAX was slightly higher around 21,800 on Monday, as investors continued to monitor corporate earnings while also assessing the potential impact of additional trade tariffs from the US administration.

President Donald Trump revealed plans to impose a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminum entering the US, adding that he would announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that the EU is ready to respond "within an hour" if the US imposes tariffs on European goods.
