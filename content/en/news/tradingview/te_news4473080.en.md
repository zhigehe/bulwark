Germany’s 10-year Bund yield fell to 2.367% on Monday, nearing a 5-week low, as investors turned their attention to US tariff risks and deflationary pressures in the Eurozone.

President Trump announced new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and vowed reciprocal duties on countries taxing U.S. goods.

In response, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that Europe would retaliate "within an hour" if the U.S. imposes tariffs on the EU. This came amid a tense pre-election debate, where Scholz defended his leadership against criticism from conservative challenger Friedrich Merz, who accused him of mismanaging Germany’s economy.

Meanwhile, markets priced in a 1.89% ECB deposit rate for December, as Eurozone inflation hit 2.5% in January, with core inflation stable at 2.7%.
