West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil weakened on Wednesday following three days of gains as a report showed a rise rise in U.S. oil inventories last week.

WTI crude oil for March delivery closed down US$1.95 to settle at US$71.37 per barrel, while April Brent crude was last seen down US$1.79 to US$75.21.

The drop comes as Energy Information Administration reported U.S. commercial oil inventories rose by 4.1-million barrels last week, while analysts polled by Oilprice.com expected, on average, a rise of 2.8-million barrels. While high, the rise was less than half the 9.04-million barrel increase reported on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute.

The survey was the third-straight to show a weekly rise in U.S. inventories, a sign of light demand. In its Short-Term Energy Outlook released on Tuesday, the EIA said it expects supply to begin to outstrip demand in the second quarter of this year, as Western Hemisphere production rises by an estimated 1.6-million barrels per day and demand growth remains low.

"Oil consumption growth in our forecast continues to be slower than the pre-pandemic trend. Our forecast of global liquid fuels consumption increases by 1.4 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, driven primarily by demand from non-OECD Asia," the agency noted.

In its Monthly Oil Market Report released on Wednesday, OPEC left its 2025 demand-growth forecast unchanged at 1.4-million b/d.
