The release of Time Your Throws on the NAKA Mobile App could boost engagement with Nakamoto Games. Making popular games like this one accessible on mobile might increase user activity and adoption of the platform. More active users could benefit the NAKA token, as in-game purchases and interactions may rise, which could positively affect the token's price. However, the impact depends on how many new players the game attracts and how much existing users engage with it. It adds potential but with uncertainty around exact effects. source
