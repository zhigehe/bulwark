Key points:

* Malaysian ringgit gains 0.4%
* Malaysia Q4 GDP awaited
* Indonesia stocks add 0.8%

The Malaysian ringgit led gains among a group of tepid Asian emerging currencies on Friday ahead of the country's economic growth data, while trading in the Philippine peso was mostly cautious after the central bank's surprising rate decision.

The ringgit was trading 0.4% higher against the greenback in early Asian trade, while equities in Kuala Lumpur were steady.

Southeast Asia's third-largest economy expanded 4.8% year on year in the last quarter, in line with a preliminary estimate released in January, according to a Reuters poll of 18 economists.

Analysts at Maybank expect fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth to come in at 4.9%, slightly higher than the advance estimate reflecting sustained growth momentum in construction work value.

In 2024, the Malaysian economy outpaced official growth estimates, its currency became the top performer in emerging markets, and the government remained stable for a second straight year after a prolonged period of political instability.

Meanwhile, the Philippines, stunned markets on Thursday by suspending its easing cycle and expressed caution, underscoring challenges policymakers in growing economies face as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts markets with his tariff policy.

The peso was trading slightly lower against the U.S. dollar, while equities in Manila fell 0.2%.

"I think it just goes to show how concerned central banks are becoming around the increased policy environment. We have only another 25 basis point rate cut for BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) in our forecast... BSP will be more cautious with rate cuts going forward," said Lavanya Venkateswaran, senior ASEAN economist, OCBC Bank.

Other currency markets in the region were mostly trading in a tight range, with the Indonesian rupiah and Taiwanese dollar up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.

The Singaporean dollar was flat, while the Thai baht fell 0.1% against the U.S. dollar.

Shares in Asia were mostly mixed as markets assessed indications that reciprocal U.S. tariffs could be weeks away from taking effect, raising hopes for negotiations that might reduce their impact.

Equity markets in Indonesia led gains, rising 0.8%, while South Korean shares gained 0.3%.

The upbeat stock markets indicate that investors are hoping negotiations to soften the impact of the U.S. tariffs, mirroring the reaction to delays on tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico earlier this month.

Shares in Taiwan TWSE:TAIEX, Singapore and China fell between 0.1% and 0.8%.

HIGHLIGHTS:

\*\* Thailand's economy likely grew at its fastest pace in over two years in Q4

\*\* Singapore grows 5.0% y/y in Q4Â 2024
