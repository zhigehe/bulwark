The FTSE MIB rose to around 37,242 in early trading on Monday, extending gains from the previous week as investors awaited more corporate earnings and assessed the implications of new US tariffs.

President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US and indicated that new reciprocal tariffs will be introduced this week.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared that the EU is prepared to respond "within an hour" if the US imposes tariffs on European goods.

Among individual stocks, early top performers included Stellantis (+1.3%), Tenaris (+1.4%), Banca Generali (%), and Prysmian (0.9%).
