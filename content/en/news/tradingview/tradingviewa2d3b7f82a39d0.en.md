DHI Group, Inc., a leading provider of data, insights, and employment connections for technology professionals, has released its 2024 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the competitive market for technology talent acquisition.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Revenues:** $141.9 million, a decrease of 6.6% from the previous year, driven by macroeconomic conditions affecting renewal rates and new business activity.

**Operating Income:** $6.3 million, with a margin of 4.5%, slightly up from the previous year's margin of 4.1%, due to lower operating expenses, particularly in sales and marketing.

**Net Income:** $0.3 million, significantly lower than the previous year's $3.5 million, primarily due to higher tax expenses.

**Diluted Earnings Per Share:** $0.01, down from $0.08 in the previous year, impacted by increased tax expenses related to stock-based compensation.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments:** ClearanceJobs experienced a 7.5% increase in revenue, driven by high demand for professionals with government clearance and consistent product releases. Dice, however, saw a 13.5% decrease in revenue due to macroeconomic conditions affecting renewal rates and new business activity.

**Sales Units:** ClearanceJobs had 1,949 recruitment package customers, a 5% decrease from the previous year, while Dice had 4,711 customers, a 14% decrease. The decline was attributed to lower renewals and macroeconomic conditions.

**New Product Launches:** In 2024, ClearanceJobs introduced ClearanceJobs Live and ClearanceJobs Pulse Newsfeed, enhancing engagement with security-cleared professionals. Dice launched the Dice Recruiter App, Easy Post Integration, Discover Companies, and TopResume Integration to improve user experience and engagement.

**Future Outlook:** The company anticipates a return to revenue growth as the number of new tech job postings began to grow slowly in late 2024. DHI Group plans to continue investing in product development and marketing to expand its technologist community and improve onboarding experiences.

**Operational Strategy:** The company is focusing on building best-in-class candidate quality and match capabilities, transforming its brands into indispensable tech-focused career marketplaces, and investing in functional excellence and product innovation.

**Restructuring and Workforce:** In January 2025, DHI Group announced an organizational restructuring to streamline operations and reduce costs, including an 8% workforce reduction. This restructuring aims to provide dedicated leadership for each brand and foster a unified vision and strategy.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Strategic Reorganization:** The company announced a strategic reorganization on January 13, 2025, restructuring its operations into two distinct divisions to provide dedicated leadership for each brand, ClearanceJobs and Dice. This reorganization aims to foster a unified vision and strategy tailored to their respective market dynamics.

**Capital Management:** The company implemented an organizational restructuring in January 2025 to streamline operations and reduce operating costs, including an 8% workforce reduction. A new stock repurchase program was approved on January 21, 2025, allowing the purchase of up to $5.0 million of common stock through February 2026. The company also adopted a Section 382 Rights Plan on January 28, 2025, to preserve tax attributes by discouraging stockholders from acquiring 4.99% or more of the company's outstanding common stock without board approval. The company has a $100 million revolving credit facility with $32.0 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024, leaving $56.0 million available for future borrowings.

**Future Outlook:** The company anticipates capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately $9 million to $11 million, funded by operating cash flows. It plans to continue its focus on signing multi-year contracts to enhance backlog and future revenue. The company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months and beyond. However, it remains vigilant about potential risks, including lender commitments and market conditions that could impact liquidity.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Market Risks:** The company operates in a highly competitive market with low barriers to entry. It faces competition from generalist job boards and specialized platforms, which may have greater resources and brand recognition. The company's ability to adapt to technological changes and offer new products is crucial to maintaining its market position.

**Operational Risks:** The company's strategic focus on technology professionals increases its dependence on the demand for such professionals. A downturn in demand, as seen with planned layoffs in large technology companies, could adversely affect sales of recruitment packages.

**Regulatory Risks:** The company is subject to various regulations concerning data privacy and security. Compliance with evolving laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), is critical. Non-compliance could lead to legal liabilities and damage to the company's reputation.

**Technological Risks:** The integration and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the company's offerings present risks related to data security, ethical concerns, and potential regulatory actions. AI systems may be flawed or biased, leading to reputational harm or legal liability.

**Financial Risks:** The company has outstanding indebtedness, which could limit its financial flexibility. Adverse changes in credit markets may affect the company's ability to borrow funds or refinance its debt.

**Management's Discussion and Analysis:** Management acknowledges the challenges posed by the competitive landscape and the need to innovate continuously. The company is focused on improving user experience and profitability, despite a decline in revenue. Management is committed to balancing profitability with investments in innovation to drive future growth.

**Market Risk Disclosures:** DHI Group, Inc. is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in demand for technology professionals and potential changes in economic conditions. The company must navigate these risks while maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
