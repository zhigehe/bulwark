Poste Italiane is considering a potential investment in Telecom Italia (TIM), two people with knowledge of the matter said, as the former phone monopoly also draws interest from rival Iliad and private equity fund CVC Capital Partners.

Sources told Reuters on Friday that the French telecoms group and CVC had separately informed the Italian government of their respective interest.

Poste, which offers mobile phone services through Poste Mobile, is also evaluating whether any potential commercial partnership could be strengthened through an equity investment.

No decision has yet been taken, the sources said, and Telecom Italia does not feature on the official agenda of a board meeting Poste has called for Monday, one of them added.

One possible way for Poste to invest in TIM would be to take the 9.8% stake held by state-investor Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the two people said.

CDP, which is TIM's second biggest investor after French media group Vivendi , declined to comment.

Poste would be a state-backed investor like CDP but it would have the advantage of running a business that lends itself to commercial partnerships with TIM.

Also the main investor in the Italian telecoms group, France's Vivendi , is open to divesting its 24% TIM stake, sources have previously told Reuters.

Shares in TIM, which gained 6.3% on Friday lifted by suitors' interest, erased initial gains on Monday to lose 0.9% by 0826 GMT.

TIM is due to present a strategy update on Thursday after CEO Pietro Labriola last year managed to push through the sale of the group's main asset, its landline grid, in a multi-billion sale to U.S. fund KKR which helped the group to cut debt and shore up its finances.
