RBC Capital Markets noted Heineken's "excellent set of results" on Wednesday but kept the stock at underperform with a price target of 75 euros.

"We can find little to fault with these [2024] results (unusually for us). There was a solid net revenue beat," analysts wrote. The research firm also said operating profit growth topped estimates while the 1.5 billion-euro share buyback program was widely anticipated.

Looking ahead, RBC said it hopes the Dutch brewer "to step up investment given its premium portfolio and price increases ahead of peers."
