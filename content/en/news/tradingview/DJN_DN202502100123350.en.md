The yen strengthens against other G-10 and Asian currencies in the early morning session amid mild risk-off sentiment likely spurred by losses across U.S. equity-index futures. On Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. He also warned that the tariff rate "may go higher," Commerzbank Research analysts say in a research report. U.S. stock futures are down a bit following Trump's announcement, the analysts note. USD/JPY edges 0.1% lower to 151.86; AUD/JPY is down 0.2% at 95.26; EUR/JPY is down 0.1% at 156.48.
