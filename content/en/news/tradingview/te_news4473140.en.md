The yield on France’s 10-year OAT hovered around 3.1%, near a recent five-week low, as investors weighed the potential impact of US tariffs and broader risks to Europe’s economic growth.

Concerns intensified after US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose reciprocal duties this week, alongside a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports.

Meanwhile, sluggish economic data from the Eurozone and inflation staying within projections reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank will maintain its easing stance.

Markets are now pricing in an additional 85 basis points in ECB rate cuts this year, following last month’s 25 basis point reduction.
