WTI crude oil futures held its decline around $71.20 per barrel on Thursday, as investor sentiment remained subdued following talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The two leaders had agreed to open negotiations aimed at ending the ongoing war in Ukraine, sparking speculation that a resolution could reduce supply risks from one of the worldâ€™s largest oil exporters.

Adding to the pressure, the latest US inflation data showed rising inflationary trends, reinforcing expectations of a continued hawkish Federal Reserve stance and putting strain on commodities priced in US dollars.

Further market jitters came from the release of the latest EIA crude oil inventories report.

The data revealed a significant 4.1 million-barrel increase in US crude oil stockpiles last week, exceeding the expected 3 million-barrel rise.

Meanwhile, OPEC maintained its 2025 oil demand growth forecast at 1.45 million barrels per day, offering little support for prices.
