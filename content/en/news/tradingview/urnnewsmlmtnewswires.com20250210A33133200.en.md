Satellos Bioscience on Monday said it has completed enrollment of all four multiple-ascending dose cohorts for the Phase 1 clinical trial of SAT-3247 in healthy volunteers.

SAT-3247 is a small molecule drug being developed by Satellos to regenerate skeletal muscle which is lost in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and other degenerative or injury conditions.

"The completion of healthy volunteer enrollment in our Phase 1 trial marks a significant milestone in our mission to develop transformative therapies for patients with degenerative diseases," said Frank Gleeson, Satellos chief executive. "We believe SAT-3247 represents a novel, well-tolerated, and more favorable treatment option as an oral, once-daily therapy designed to restore muscle regeneration and repair in all DMD patients, whether used as a stand-alone drug or an add-on therapy."

The Phase 1 clinical trial is comprised of two components. In the first component, 72 healthy volunteers have been enrolled to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of SAT-3247. The second component, the Phase 1b portion of the trial, is ongoing. Up to 10 adult volunteers with genetically confirmed DMD will be enrolled in a 28-day single dose cohort to assess safety and pharmacokinetic properties in patients.
