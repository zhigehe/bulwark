NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange fell 0.3 percent in late January, the exchange said on Tuesday. As of Jan. 31, short interest fell to about 16.318 billion shares, compared with 16.372 billion shares as of Jan. 15. Investors who sell securities short borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
