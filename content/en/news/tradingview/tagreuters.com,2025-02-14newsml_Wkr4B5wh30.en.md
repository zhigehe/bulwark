Konecranes customer Boluda Maritime Terminals Tenerife has placed an order for four hybrid Konecranes Rubber-Tired Gantry (RTG) cranes equipped with many Smart Features. The contract was signed in December 2024.

Boluda Maritime Terminals Tenerife (Boluda) is an independent port operator providing container handling and logistics services at the Port of Tenerife, a strategic hub in the Canary Islands for trade between Africa, the Americas and Europe.

The company opted for hybrid Konecranes RTGs after reviewing fuel consumption calculations and comparisons that demonstrated the fuel efficiency and eco-efficiency of Konecranes hybrid drives.

“Konecranes hybrid drive technology provides the perfect balance of performance and environmental responsibility. The Smart Features also contribute to more efficient container handling and enhanced safety,” says Gonzalo Calero Gómez**,** CEO of Boluda Maritime Terminals.

The four new cranes will join two Konecranes RTGs. The long-term reliability of these existing RTGs, delivered in 2007, reinforced Boluda’s confidence both in the durability of Konecranes technology and how it keeps improving. Evidence of this is seen In the Smart Features that will come with the new cranes: Auto-Steering, Auto-TOS Positioning, Auto-Positioning, Stack Collision Prevention and Truck Lift Prevention.

“We look forward to supporting Boluda's journey to zero tailpipe emission operations. This investment Is further evidence of growing demand for hybrid solutions in container handling and underscores Konecranes’ strength in this domain,” says Darryn Scheepers, EMEA Sales Director, Konecranes, Port Solutions.

This contract is part of Ecolifting, Konecranes’ vision to increase its handprint – meaning the beneficial environmental impact that can be achieved with our product and service portfolio – while reducing customers’ carbon footprints. From eco-optimizing diesel drives, to hybridization and fully-electrified fleets, we will continue to do more with less.

A strong focus on customers and commitment to business growth and continuous improvement make Konecranes a material handling industry leader. This is underpinned by investments in digitalization and technology, plus our work to make material flows more efficient with solutions that decarbonize the economy and advance circularity and safety.
