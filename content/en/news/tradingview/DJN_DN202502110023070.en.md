TUI's first-quarter performance suggests that its guidance for fiscal 2025 is achievable and consensus estimates could even increase if trends remain strong, Jefferies analysts say. However, the company's affirmed guidance implies EBIT growth could slow in the remainder of the year, the analysts write in a research note. Current performance appears positive for TUI's hotels and cruises business in the second quarter and it is suggestive of continued strong demand for travel in Europe. Nevertheless, summer bookings moderated from December when TUI published its year-end results. Summer bookings grew 2% on-year in the quarter with 4% higher average prices, compared with 7% higher bookings and 3% higher prices. TUI shares trade 8.7% down to 7.77 euros.
