Treasury yields end a turbulent week going in different directions, as tariff threats spark fears of higher inflation in the short term and slowing economic growth later on. Forecasters have been trying to estimate the impact of tariffs on prices, but the task has been complicated by the Trump administration's on-and-off approach. January consumer and producer price index are both due next week and little change is expected. Future markets show diminishing bets on more than one cut by the Fed this year. The 10-year falls 0.083 percentage point this week, to 4.483%, while the two-year rises 0.042 p.p. to 4.277%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
