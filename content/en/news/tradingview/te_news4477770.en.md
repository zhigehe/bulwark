The FTSE MIB edged higher to around 37,641 in early trading on Thursday, hovering near multi-year highs but lagging behind its European peers as declines in financial stocks capped gains.

Market sentiment improved after the presidents of Russia and the United States signaled openness to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, investors remained focused on corporate earnings, with Moncler, Recordati, and Telecom Italia set to release their Q4 results today.

Among individual stocks, Stellantis surged over 3%, while Ferrari (+1%), STMicroelectronics (+1.6%), Moncler (+1.7%), Davide Campari-Milano (+2.9%), and Nexi (+2.8%) also posted strong gains.

On the downside, UniCredit (-1.5%), Banco BPM SPA (-1.8%), and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (-1.1%) led the losses.
