Yum! Brands' 2025 core operating profit growth target of 8% is achievable, with its Taco Bell segment's momentum and share gains likely to extend into 2025, UBS said Friday in a note.

The company's Q4 same-store sales growth of 1% mirrored Taco Bell's "solid" 5% same-store sales growth and "improving global momentum across most of the brand portfolio," the firm said.

"We expect Taco Bell's momentum and share gains to continue into 2025, and model 6% Q1 Taco Bell US same-store sales," UBS said, adding that "exciting" new menu news and "attractive" brand growth plans and targets are expected to be unveiled during the March 4 Taco Bell Consumer Day.

The company's 2025 core operating profit growth guidance is attainable despite an anticipated lower unit growth due to elevated closures, UBS added.

UBS raised its price target for stock to $165 from $156, while reiterating its buy recommendation.
