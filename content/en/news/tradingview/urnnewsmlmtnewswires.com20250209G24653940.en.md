Platina Resources launched diamond drilling activities at the aero-electromagnetic "deeps" target within its Xanadu gold project in Western Australia, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The campaign is being carried out to find the source of gold within a 10-kilometer mineralized corridor defined by historical shallow drilling in the project's western tenements, according to managing director Corey Nolan.
