Sugar futures traded above 20 cents per pound, their highest since mid-December, after Indonesia announced plans to import 200,000 metric tons of raw sugar to boost its food reserves amid rising domestic white sugar prices.

Meanwhile, the USDA in its February WASDE report projected US sugar consumption for the 2024/25 season to decline to 12.48 million short tons, marking the third consecutive annual decrease.

Sugar production in 2024-25 was forecast at 9,370,000 tons, down 34,000 tons from 2023-24 but still a record high if realized.

In India, the worldâ€™s second-largest producer, exports have reached 500,000 metric tons this season, although the export pace is slowing.

Looking forward, Green Pool analysts predict a global sugar surplus of 2.7 million tons for MY 2025/26, reversing the 3.7 million ton deficit of MY 2024/25.
