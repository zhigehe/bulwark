Wall Street futures pointed flat to modestly lower pre-bell Wednesday as traders awaited the latest inflation report from Washington and further testimony by the nation's top central banker to Congress.

The January consumer price index (CPI) bulletin posts at 8:30 am ET in Washington, with pundits projecting a 2.9% on-year rise, but 3.1% on the CPI-core that excludes certain food and energy costs.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to appear before the the US House of Representatives at 10 am ET, but is expected to repeat his sentiments expressed before the US Senate on Tuesday, and that is that the Fed is about right in holding interest rates steady for a while.

In the futures, the S&P 500 fell 0.2%, the Nasdaq was down 0.1% and the Dow Jones was off 0.2%.

Asian exchanges traded mostly higher overnight, with China-based real estate issues rallying after media reports that Beijing plans a multi-billion dollar support plan for ailing developer China Vanke.

European bourses tracked moderately north midday on the continent.

CME (CME), CVS Health (CVS) and Dominion Energy (D) plan to report earnings pre-bell, among others. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reports after-bell.

On the economic calendar, in addition to the CPI bulletin and Chair Powell hearing, is the weekly MBA mortgage applications bulletin at 7 am ET, followed by the weekly EIA petroleum status report at 10:30 am.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks at noon, followed by Fed Governor Christopher Waller at 5:05 pm.

In premarket action, Bitcoin traded at $96,196, West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded lower at $72.48, and 10-year US Treasuries offered 4.55%. Spot gold traded for $2,889 an ounce.
