US stocks trimmed sharper losses from morning trading as markets continued to assess how the corporate sector may fare against an increase in long-dated Treasury yields.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were close to the flatline, while the Dow trimmed its 500 point plunge but remained firmly lower.

Both headline and core inflation rates were firmly above expectations in January, backing concerns that the Federal Reserve will be forced to hold rates at the restrictive level for a longer time to tame above-target price growth.

Consequently, investors moved to expect a single rate cut this year instead of earlier bets of two or more, while a third of the market has priced no cuts.

Most sectors hovered in the red, with Exxon Mobil, Blackstone, and Oracle losing more than 2%.

On the other hand, Tesla added 5%, while Apple advanced over 1%.

On the earnings front, Coca Cola edged higher after delivering results, and Cisco edged below the flatline ahead of its earnings print after the bell.
