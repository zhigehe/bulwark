Sun Country Airlines Holdings said Monday that a secondary public offering of its roughly 6.3 million common shares by an affiliate of certain investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management has been priced.

The 6,346,105 shares subject to the offering represent all the remaining Sun Country Airlines shares owned by the selling stockholder, the company said.

The company said it has agreed to acquire about $10 million of the shares from the underwriters.

The offering is expected to close Tuesday.
