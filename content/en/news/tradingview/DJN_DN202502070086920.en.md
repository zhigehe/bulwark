Uber Technologies stock is trading at a "massive discount," Bill Ackman said Friday as he revealed that his hedge fund had established a significant stake in the ride-hailing company.

In a post on X, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management said his hedge fund began buying stock of Uber in January and accumulated a total of 30.3 million shares.

Uber stock jumped 8.3% to $75.76 on Friday. Based on current levels, Pershing Square's stake would be worth around $2.3 billion.

Ackman described Uber as "one of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world," arguing that its stock could be purchased at a lofty discount to its intrinsic value. "This favorable combination of attributes is extremely rare, particularly for a large cap company," he wrote.
