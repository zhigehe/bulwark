Santak trimmed its loss attributable to owners of the company for six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024 to SG$1.1 million from SG$1.5 million a year earlier, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange on Wednesday.

Loss per share narrowed to SG$0.0105 compared with SG$0.0136 in the comparable period.

Revenue in fiscal H1 declined 15% year over year to SG$4.1 million from SG$4.8 million, mainly due to lower sales from the group's trading and distribution divisions.
