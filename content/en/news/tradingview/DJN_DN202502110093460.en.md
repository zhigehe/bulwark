WINNIPEG, Manitoba--Intercontinental Exchange canola futures rallied for a fourth consecutive session on Tuesday.

Support came from the tightening canola supply situation in Canada as exports and domestic use remain strong.

Gains in Chicago soyoil and European rapeseed spilled over into canola, but those increases were tempered by losses in Chicago soybeans and soymeal. Crude oil was on the upswing, lending support to the vegetable oils.

The United States Department of Agriculture kept its estimate on Canadian canola production for 2024/25 at 18.80 million tonnes.

In December, Statistics Canada pegged the oilseed's harvest at 17.85 million tonnes.

An analyst warned that a downward correction in canola futures could soon hit.

The Canadian dollar was higher on Tuesday afternoon with the loonie at 69.98 U.S. cents compared to Monday's close of 69.82.

There were 72,913 contracts traded on Tuesday, compared to 75,660 on Monday. Spreading accounted for 53,098 contracts traded.

Prices are in Canadian dollars per metric tonne:
