Castellum has, for the first time, been awarded the highest score (A) in the CDP climate ranking, which is a global system for reporting environmental impact. Moreover, the company has been included in The Sustainability Yearbook – a prestigious ranking that highlights the most outstanding companies in sustainability – for the ninth consecutive year.

“Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy and business model. Receiving the highest marks in CDP while being included in The Sustainability Yearbook for the ninth year in a row is confirmation of our hard work. Our ambition is to continue enabling the climate transition while creating long-term value for our stakeholders,” says Joacim Sjöberg, CEO of Castellum AB.

Castellum has, for the first time, been awarded the highest score (A) in the CDP climate ranking, on a scale from A to D-. Castellum is one of only a few European property companies to have achieved this.

Moreover, for the ninth consecutive year Castellum has been included in The Sustainability Yearbook, produced by S&P Global, that identifies companies who are top performers in their respective industries. Castellum ranks first in the Nordic countries, first in Europe and eighth globally. This ranking is intended to guide investors towards sustainable alternatives and promote business models that enable long-term climate benefit.

Examples of Castellum’s sustainability initiatives

* **Stricter climate requirements for projects:** Starting in 2025, all larger new construction, extensions and reconstructions are to reduce their climate impact by 50 per cent compared with a reference building, calculated using the NollCO2 standard. Energy efficiency must be improved by 40 per cent for offices and 30 per cent for logistics compared with current construction regulations, and all projects must be equipped with solar PV systems. The goal is for all projects to be climate neutral.
* **Climate risk assessment**: Castellum has analysed its entire property portfolio to identify and manage risks associated with climate change such as flooding, rising water levels and landslides. The climate risks in Castellum's property portfolio are currently assessed as low and the goal is not to own properties subject to serious climate risks.
* **Work environment:** Castellum is committed to achieving zero workplace injuries and work-related illness among both employees and contractors.
