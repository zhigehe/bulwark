When used herein, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “should,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include but are not limited to: (i) the parties’ ability to complete the transaction on the anticipated terms and timing, or at all, and the parties’ ability to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the transaction; (ii) potential litigation relating to the transaction that could be instituted against the Company or its directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (iii) the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the pendency of the transaction; (iv) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (v) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; (vi) legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (vii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the transaction that could affect the Company’s financial performance; (viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (ix) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including but not limited to acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or pandemic, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; (x) the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (xi) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the transaction, including in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; (xii) those risks and uncertainties set forth under the headings “Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov; and (xiii) those risks that are described in the definitive proxy statement regarding the transaction that was filed with the SEC on January 6, 2025 and is available from the sources indicated below.

These risks, as well as other risks associated with the transaction, are more fully discussed in the definitive proxy statement that was filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed, or if they are completed, they will be completed when expected. The preceding summary of factors, risks and uncertainties should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements relate only to events that have occurred and circumstances that exist as of the date the statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the Company’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company’s actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of the Company’s forward-looking statements. You should specifically consider the factors identified in this communication that could cause actual results to differ. Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company to predict those events or how they may affect the Company.
