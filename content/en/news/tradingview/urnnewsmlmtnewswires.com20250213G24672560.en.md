ST Group Food Industries' profit attributable to equity holders for six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024 slid 7.6% to AU$1.3 million from AU$1.4 million a year earlier, a filing with the Singapore Exchange said on Wednesday.

Earnings per share declined to AU$0.0049 compared with AU$0.0055 in the comparable period.

Revenue declined 4.7% year over year to AU$34.0 million from AU$35.7 million, due to decreased sales from F&B Retails and lower franchise revenue.
