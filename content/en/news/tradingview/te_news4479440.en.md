India’s wholesale prices climbed by 2.31% year-on-year in January 2025, slightly easing from a 2.37% rise in December, below forecasts of a 2.50% gain.

This marks the 15th consecutive month of wholesale inflation, though it eased from the fastest pace in six months in December, boosted by further rises in manufacturing and food prices.
