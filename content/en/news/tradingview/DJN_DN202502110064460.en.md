Bank of Nova Scotia's economics team says it now anticipates one more rate cut from the Bank of Canada, to account for uncertainty created by trade policy from President Trump. Chief economist Jean-Francois Perrault says Scotiabank now anticipates weaker growth for Canada in 2025, despite a strong end to last year and strong start in January. This reflects "a more pronounced increase in uncertainty, in line with volatility we witnessed in recent weeks that is likely to persist for some time," he says in an updated forecast. One more quarter-point cut, to 2.75%, would bring rates to the midpoint of the BOC's estimated range for neutral--or the level that neither stimulates nor contracts from growth.
