The Japanese yen fell hard Wednesday following the U.S. CPI report. While USD/JPY led the way, the upside was relatively limited and many Tokyo pundits believe the pair's 2025 downtrend may be intact.

The hotter-than-expected U.S. CPI reading , corollary expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for longer and resulting jump in Treasury yields hit JPY hard.

Similar speed bumps emerged recently with U.S. announcements of trade tariffs and what was considered a relatively strong U.S. jobs report Friday .

Though USD/JPY remains relatively bid between 154.13-66 in Tokyo trading Thursday, the daily Ichimoku cloud between 153.60-155.62 has cushioned its rise. The 55-day moving average at 154.85 also looks to be posing resistance for now.

Although further USD/JPY upside cannot be ruled out, the Fed will eventually cut rates and the Bank of Japan will maintain its hawkish bias , . This alone may suffice to keep JPY moving higher.

Fed expectations and moves in U.S. yields will likely remain the primary focus for USD/JPY players, but the effect of oil and energy prices cannot be ignored. A major slump in crude oil prices denominated in dollars could prove to be an inordinate hit on USD .

The JPY crosses have mostly been hostage to moves in USD/JPY. And, like the Fed, other major central banks are looking to cut their policy rates going forward. This being the case, Wednesday's rallies may be reversed should USD/JPY head south again. Previous comments , , .
