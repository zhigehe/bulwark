Mitsubishi Chemical Group said it will sell its pharmaceutical subsidiary, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, to Bain Capital for about 510 billion yen, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.

The Osaka-based drugmaker has faced increasing R&D costs amid a shrinking pool of unmet medical needs. Mitsubishi Chemical said the sale aligns with its long-term strategy and will help reduce debt, boost shareholder returns, and strengthen its chemicals business.

The deal includes Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma's subsidiaries, such as Medicago and Alpha Therapeutic.
