A China-funded steel plant costing $546 million in Bolivia will start production in February with enough capacity to cover half the country's needs, Reuters reported Thursday, citing Bolivian officials.

The Mutun plant, originally planned about 50 years back, was mainly funded by the Export-Import Bank of China and will be operated by China's Sinosteel Engineering and Technology for its first year.

The plant is expected to produce 200,000 metric tons of steel a year, principally rebar and wire mesh, worth $260 million, the publication said.
