Zinc futures rose to $2,850 per tonne, extending the rebound from the over-four-month low of $2,750 touched on January 31st as supply concerns continued to support asking prices, outweighing the uncertain outlook on global demand.

New aggregates showed that global mined zinc production fell for the third consecutive year in 2024.

This was consistent with a 7% decline in refined zinc from China, as lower processing rates drove the country’s largest operators to ease output.

Also, the Red Dog Mine in Alaska, the world’s largest zinc mine, and responsible for 10% of global output, is due to slow in 2025 as it approaches its depletion of ore.

On the other hand, official data from China showed that activity in its largest manufacturers unexpectedly declined in January despite earlier optimism that improved credit demand would drive growth for goods.
