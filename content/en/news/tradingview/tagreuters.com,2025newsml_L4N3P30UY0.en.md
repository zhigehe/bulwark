Restaurant Brands on Wednesday topped market expectations for quarterly revenue, helped by strong demand for value meals at its Burger King chain and strength in its Tim Hortons coffee outlets.

Value offers from fast food chains over the past six months have helped attract price-conscious consumers. Burger King, like McDonald's and Taco Bell-parent Yum Brands , has been offering combo options for as less as $5 and $7.

The company's Tim Hortons chain has benefited from several quarters of strong growth in revenue, particularly in Canada.

The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.30 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
