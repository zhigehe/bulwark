TROY, Mich., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —  Kelly (Nasdaq: KELYA, KELYB), a leading specialty talent solutions provider, today announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings.

* Q4 revenue of $1.2 billion, down 3.3% year-over-year reflecting the previously disclosed dispositions and acquisitions, and up 4.4% on an organic basis. Full-year revenue of $4.3 billion, down 10.4% as reported and up 0.5% on an organic basis.
* Q4 operating loss of $56.7 million on $80.8 million non-cash impairment charges; $29.2 million of operating income on an adjusted basis, up 32% versus the prior year period
* Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $43.5 million, up 34% versus the prior year; adjusted EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points versus the prior year period to 3.7%
* Full-year operating loss of $15.1 million resulting from non-cash impairment charges; adjusted operating income of $92.1 million; adjusted EBITDA of $143.5 million, up 31% versus the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.3%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year
* Company expects to deliver incremental organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion during fiscal 2025
* Announces planned retirement of president and chief executive officer Peter Quigley by the end of 2025

“We are pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, during which we drove organic revenue growth that outpaced the market and increased adjusted EBITDA by 34 percent. Our positive performance bookended a year of significant strategic progress on our specialty growth journey as we continued to shift toward higher margin, higher growth markets and solutions,” said Peter Quigley, president and chief executive officer. “In 2024, we delivered 100 basis points of net margin expansion, unlocked more than $100 million in capital by further streamlining our operating model, and redeployed that capital toward our transformational acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners. We enter 2025 a more efficient and focused company well positioned to capitalize as demand improves and deliver top- and bottom-line growth.”

Financial Results for the thirteen-week period ended December 29, 2024:

* Revenue of $1.2 billion, a 3.3% decrease compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 resulting primarily from the sale of the Company’s European staffing operations on January 2, 2024, partially offset by the May 2024 acquisition of Motions Recruitment Partners (“MRP”). Excluding the European staffing operations and MRP, revenue was up 4.4% on an organic basis as organic growth initiatives drove market share gains despite broader industry declines. MRP revenue added 9.8% to reported fourth-quarter year-over-year revenue growth.
* Operating loss of $56.7 million, reflecting $80.8 million in non-cash impairment charges compared to earnings of $7.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings1 were $29.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA1 of $43.5 million, an increase of 34% versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7%, an increase of 110 basis points. Reflects organic improvement of 50 basis points and a 60 basis point impact from the European staffing operations sale.
* Loss per share was $0.90 compared to earnings per share of $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2023. On an adjusted basis1, earnings per share were $0.82 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $0.93 per share in the corresponding quarter of 2023.

Financial results for the 52-week period ended December 29, 2024:

* Revenue of $4.3 billion, a decrease of 10.4% compared to the prior year resulting primarily from the sale of the European staffing operations partially offset by the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the impact of the European staffing operations sale and MRP, revenue was up 0.5% on an organic basis. MRP added 5.9% to reported year-over-year revenue growth.
* Operating loss of $15.1 million, reflecting $86.3 million of non-cash impairment charges compared to earnings of $24.3 million reported in 2023. Adjusted earnings1 were $92.1 million in 2024 and $69.1 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $143.5 million, an increase of 31% versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA1 margin of 3.3%, an increase of 100 basis points. Reflects organic improvement of 50 basis points, a 40 basis point impact from the European staffing sale and 10 basis point improvement from the acquisition of MRP.
* Loss per share was $0.02 compared to earnings per share of $0.98 in 2023. On an adjusted basis1, earnings per share were $2.34 in 2024 compared to $2.20 per share in 2023.

* *Tax rate* – effective rate in the high teens

Planned Retirement of President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Quigley:

Kelly also announced that Peter Quigley has informed Kelly’s board of directors of his intention to retire from his role as president and chief executive officer by the end of 2025. Quigley intends to serve in his current role until his successor is appointed and an orderly transition is completed. The compensation and talent management committee of the board, which is responsible for executive development and succession, has initiated a process to identify Quigley’s successor and engaged a nationally recognized search firm. The board will consider internal and external candidates with the skills and experience to continue accelerating the Company’s progress on its specialty growth journey.

The anticipated retirement of Quigley, who will turn 64 in April, follows a successful career that includes 22 years with Kelly. Prior to being named president and chief executive officer in 2019, he served as an officer in key roles including general counsel and chief administrative officer, and president of global staffing. Quigley’s leadership and passion for serving customers and talent have been instrumental to Kelly’s transformation into a leading global specialty talent solutions provider.

**Quarterly Cash Dividend and Share Repurchase:**

Kelly also reported that on February 11, its board of directors declared a dividend of $0.075 per share. The dividend is payable on March 12, 2025, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2025. In addition, Kelly executed share repurchases of $10.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 as part of the previously announced, board approved share repurchase program.

In conjunction with its earnings release, Kelly has published a financial presentation and will host a live webcast of a conference call with financial analysts at 9 a.m. ET on February 13 to review the results from the quarter and answer questions. The presentation and a link to the live webcast will be accessible through the Company’s public website on the Investor Relations page under Events & Presentations. The webcast will be recorded, and a replay will be available within one hour of completion of the event through the same link as the live webcast.

**RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES**

**(UNAUDITED)**

Management believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) information excluding the 2024 goodwill impairment charge, the 2024 asset impairment charges, the 2024 integration costs, the 2024 executive transition costs, the 2024 gain on equity securities, the 2024 transaction costs, the 2024 restructuring charges, the 2024 gain on sale of assets, the 2024 gain on forward contract, the 2024 gain on the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, the 2023 restructuring charges, the 2023 transaction costs, the 2023 loss on forward contract, the 2023 asset impairment charge and the 2023 tax adjustments related to the sale of our EMEA staffing operations are useful to understand the Company's fiscal 2024 financial performance and increases comparability. Specifically, Management believes that removing the impact of these items allows for a meaningful comparison of current period operating performance with the operating results of prior periods. Management also believes that such measures are used by those analyzing performance of companies in the staffing industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to assess future performance.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue from services) which Management believes is useful to compare operating performance compared to prior periods and uses it in conjunction with GAAP measures to assess performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be used in conjunction with GAAP measurements. Management also uses year-to-date free cash flow (operating cash flows less capital expenditures) to indicate the change in cash balances arising from operating activities, net of working capital needs and expenditures on fixed assets.

These non-GAAP measures may have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude items which can have a material impact on cash flow and earnings per share. As a result, Management considers these measures, along with reported results, when it reviews and evaluates the Company's financial performance. Management believes that these measures provide greater transparency to investors and provide insight into how Management is evaluating the Company's financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
