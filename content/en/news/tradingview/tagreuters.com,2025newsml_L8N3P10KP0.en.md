EUROPE IN THE GREEN, BP TOP GAINER

Shares in Europe disregarded the latest tariff threats from U.S. President Trump and edged higher on Monday, while BP shares jumped after reports that an activist investor has built a stake in the company.

Trump said he would introduce 25% import tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminium imports in his latest trade escalation, as well as reciprocal tariffs that match rates levied by other countries.

Broader markets are largely overlooking the latest verbal warnings, with the STOXX 600 up 0.3% and bourses in Frankfurt , Paris , and London CURRENCYCOM:UK100 rising between 0.2% and 0.4%.

But the basic resources sector (.SXPP) slightly underperforms, led lower by steel and iron ore manufacturer ArcelorMittal , whose shares are down about 2.5%.

In contrast, the energy sector (.SXEP) is Europe's top gainer, supported by shares in BP after activist investor Elliott Management took a stake in the company.
