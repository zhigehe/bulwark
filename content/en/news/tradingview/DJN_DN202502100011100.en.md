By Anthony O. Goriainoff

Johnson Matthey said Chairman Patrick Thomas will step down later this year, and named DS Smith's Richard Pike as its next chief financial officer.

The U.K. chemicals company said Monday that Pike would join the board on April 1, with current CFO Stephen Oxley continuing in the role until March 31 to ensure an orderly transition.

Pike was most recently group finance director at DS Smith, and has previously held the CFO role at Biffa and Boparan Holdings, the company said.

Thomas won't stand for reelection as chairman at the annual general meeting on July 17, and the company has started a search for his successor, it said.
