BYD'S aggressive approach to install its new smart driving system directly challenges Tesla's full self-driving system, which is scheduled for launch in China, DBS says in a research note. On Monday, the Chinese auto maker introduced its advanced driver-assistance system across its vehicle models under its brands Ocean, Dynasty, Denza and Yangwang. BYD's emphasis on affordability and widespread adoption of the smart driving features is "a key differentiator compared to peers," the note says. Given that the mass market accounts for a significant proportion of the auto market, BYD is ahead of its peers in the autonomous driving assistance field, it adds. Shares were last at HK$328.40.
