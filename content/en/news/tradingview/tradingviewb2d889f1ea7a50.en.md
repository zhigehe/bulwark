Nukkleus Inc., a financial technology company focused on blockchain-enabled technology solutions, has released its annual Form 10-K report. The report details significant changes in the company's business model, financial performance, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces as it transitions towards the defense sector.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Revenues**: $5.91 million, reflecting a decrease of 72.2% from the previous year due to the termination of a customer contract and a significant decrease in financial services revenue.

**Total Gross Profit (Loss)**: $0.99 million, an improvement from a loss of $0.34 million in the prior year, driven by a reduction in the cost of financial services.

**Loss from Operations**: $(14.18) million, compared to $(17.46) million in the previous year, indicating a reduction in operating losses primarily due to lower impairment losses.

**Net Loss**: $(8.52) million, a 51.1% improvement from the previous year's net loss of $(17.43) million, largely due to gains on termination of agreements and extinguishment of obligations.

**Net Loss Per Common Share**: $(4.93), compared to $(13.84) in the prior year, reflecting the overall reduction in net loss.

**Business Highlights**

**Business Combination**: Nukkleus Inc. completed a business combination with Brilliant Acquisition Corporation, transitioning from a British Virgin Islands company to a Delaware corporation. This merger has positioned Nukkleus as a financial technology company focused on blockchain-enabled technology solutions.

**Operational Shift**: The company has shifted its focus from providing software and technology solutions for the retail foreign exchange trading industry to becoming a full-service transactions technology and advisory business, offering advanced transactions platforms for dealing and risk management.

**Termination of Key Agreements**: Nukkleus terminated its General Services Agreement with Triton Capital Markets Ltd. due to non-payment, which historically generated most of its revenue. This marks a significant operational change as the company moves away from its previous business model.

**Acquisition of Star 26 Capital Inc.**: Nukkleus entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling 51% interest in Star 26 Capital Inc., a defense acquisition company. This acquisition aligns with the company's strategic shift towards the defense sector.

**Sale of Digital RFQ Limited**: The company plans to sell its blockchain payment solutions subsidiary, Digital RFQ Limited, to focus on the defense sector, citing continued net losses from DRFQ as a reason for the sale.

**Reverse Stock Split**: Nukkleus implemented a one-for-eight reverse stock split to consolidate its shares, which is part of its strategy to enhance its capital structure.

**Future Outlook**: With the acquisition of Star 26 Capital Inc. and the sale of Digital RFQ, Nukkleus aims to focus its business operations on the defense sector, particularly in the Israeli market, leveraging its new capabilities in defense technology and products.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Strategic Focus**: Nukkleus Inc. has shifted its strategic focus from providing general support services to concentrating on the defense sector. This shift was marked by the cessation of general support services in January 2024 and the planned acquisition of a controlling 51% interest in Star 26 Capital Inc., an Israeli corporation engaged in defense products, including generators for 'iron dome' launchers.

**Capital Management**: The company implemented a one-for-eight reverse stock split effective October 24,Â 2024, and increased its authorized shares from 40,000,000 to 150,000,000. It also entered into a Conversion Agreement to convert $771,085 of outstanding principal and interest into common stock and issued additional warrants. Nukkleus raised $10 million through a private placement in December 2024, selling 1,666,666 units consisting of common stock and stock purchase warrants. The company also entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, although it was later terminated.

**Future Outlook**: Nukkleus plans to focus on the defense sector following the acquisition of Star 26 Capital Inc. The company anticipates that its current financial resources, including the $10 million raised in December 2024, will be sufficient to meet its operating budget for the next twelve months. The company is also exploring opportunities for further equity or debt financing to support its strategic initiatives and capital management activities.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Acquisition Risks**: A major risk is the potential failure to complete the acquisition of Star 26 Capital Inc., which could result in a $1.0 million termination fee and negatively affect the company's stock price and future business operations.

**Industry Volatility**: Nukkleus operates in a highly volatile and evolving industry, making it difficult to predict future prospects and increasing the risk of unsuccessful business outcomes.

**Blockchain Technology Risks**: The company relies on blockchain technology for its payment processing business, which introduces risks related to the stability and security of blockchain networks and stablecoins. Despite evaluations, the company acknowledges the inherent risks associated with blockchain technology, including potential technical vulnerabilities and regulatory scrutiny.

**Competition**: Nukkleus faces intense competition from established enterprises and early-stage companies, which could impact its market share and pricing strategies.

**Cybersecurity**: Cybersecurity is another critical risk, as the company handles confidential information and customer data. Any security breaches or cyberattacks could harm Nukkleus's reputation, result in regulatory scrutiny, and lead to financial losses.

**Regulatory Risks**: Regulatory risks are significant, as Nukkleus operates in multiple jurisdictions with varying legal requirements. Non-compliance with these regulations could result in fines, loss of licenses, and reputational damage.

**Operational Risks**: The company is exposed to operational risks related to system disruptions, which could affect its ability to provide reliable services to customers.

**Market Risks**: Nukkleus is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact its financial results. The company also faces credit risks related to counterparties, including financial institutions, which could affect its liquidity and financial stability.
