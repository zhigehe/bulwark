Deutsche Bank Research on Thursday kept its buy rating with a 20-euro price target on Commerzbank after the German bank's stellar 2024 performance and upbeat 2025 outlook.

"While the afternoon [Capital Markets Day] session will help to judge the credibility of the bullish new targets, we are particularly encouraged by the positive 2025 guidance, high near-term capital return (12.5% yield for 2025), and a new restructuring program with EUR500m of savings," analysts wrote.

The research firm also took a positive stance on Commerzbank's "relatively linear" fresh mid-term targets.

As of writing, the company's 2025 outlook for net interest income, fee income and net result including restructuring charges are all above current market consensus estimates.
