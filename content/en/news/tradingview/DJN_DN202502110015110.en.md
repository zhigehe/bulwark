Ams-Osram's guidance for the first quarter points to a weaker performance, as previously flagged, but it isn't worse than feared, Vontobel's Mark Diethelm says in a research note. The European electronics company expects first-quarter revenue of between 750 million and 850 million euros, with an adjusted Ebitda margin of 14.5% to 17.5%. Ams-Osram will continue to face challenges in the first half of 2025 due to weak demand and continued inventory adjustments, the analyst says. However, it said it expects a meaningfully stronger second half of the year. "Overall, the message is consistent and we do not expect material consensus estimate adjustments," the analyst says. Shares jump 14%. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)
