Imax looks poised to continue to raise its market share due to its rising global footprint and increasing its partnerships for this year, Wedbush said in a note Wednesday.

"We think Imax can roughly double its screen base and think it should be able to accelerate its annual screen growth as its theater partners return to profitability and have more disposable cash to upgrade theaters," analysts led by Alicia Reese said.

However, Wedbush said it lowered its Q4 estimates on Imax "due to the shortfall on certain titles, including Joker 2 and Kraven the Hunter."

The firm said it now expects Q4 revenue of $103

million on earnings of $0.29 per share, versus its prior estimates of $123 million and $0.44, respectively.

Imax is set to release its Q4 results on Feb. 19.

Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on Imax with a $32 price target.
