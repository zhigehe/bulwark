Tate & Lyle said it expects to report a fall in revenue for fiscal 2025 and for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be at the lower end of its guided range.

The FTSE 250-listed food-and-beverage ingredients company said Thursday that group revenue for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 14% to 423 million pounds ($526.4 million), including CP Kelco, which contributed 66 million pounds. Within this the food and beverage solutions business revenue fell 4% to 296 million pounds, while artificial sweetener Sucralose rose 19% to 41 million pounds.

For the nine months as a whole revenue was unchanged at 1.20 billion pounds, including CP Kelco.

The company completed its acquisition of CP Kelco on Nov. 15. It said Thursday that the integration is progressing well and that the business has performed in line with the board's expectations.

Tate & Lyle said that for the year as a whole it expects revenue to be mid-single digit percent lower and for Ebitda growth to be toward the lower end of the guidance range of between 4% and 7%.

Revenue for the year ended march 31,Â 2024, was 1.65 billion pounds.
