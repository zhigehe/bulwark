By Michael Susin

Thames Water said it asked that the U.K.'s water regulator Ofwat to refer its price review decision for the next five years to the country's competition watchdog.

The debt-laden English water company on Friday said that the current final determination for the regulatory period between 2025 to 2030 will impact its ability to make required investments and improvements to its service.

Thames Water said is proposing a regulatory settlement which provides achievable targets and appropriate balance of risk and return.

"There remain significant gaps between the final determination and what it needs to deliver for customers and the environment," Thames said.

Customer bills for 2025-26 won't be affected by the determination, the company said.

On Wednesday, Ofwat launched an investigation into delays on the completion of environmental improvements by Thames Water in 2020-25.

Thames Water committed to deliver 812 environmental improvement programs. However, the company said it is unlikely to deliver more than 100 of these by the March 31 deadline.
