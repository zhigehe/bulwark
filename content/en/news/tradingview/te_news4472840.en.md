Chinese stocks extended their gains on Monday, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.56% to close at 3,322 and the Shenzhen Component gaining 0.52% to reach 10,631—both marking their highest levels in over a month.

The rally was fueled by continued optimism surrounding breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in China, particularly with companies integrating DeepSeek’s open-source model into their operations.

The market held up even after US President Donald Trump announced plans for a blanket 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, effective later today.

In economic data, China reported a pickup in consumer inflation for January, driven by holiday spending, while producer prices continued their downward trend, falling for the 28th consecutive month.

Notable performances were seen in the tech sector, with companies like Sichuan Changhong (+10%), iSoftStone (+6.1%), Jiangsu Hoperun (+2%), Dawning Information (+2%), and Cambricon Technologies (+8.9%) leading the charge.
