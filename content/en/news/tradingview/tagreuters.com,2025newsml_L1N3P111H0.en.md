Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Monday, lifted by Nvidia and other AI-related stocks, while steelmakers surged after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Trump's latest potential trade barrier escalation came on Sunday when he said he would introduce 25% tariffs on all U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, on top of existing duties on the metals.

U.S. metals producers that would benefit from steel and aluminum tariffs rallied. Nucor , U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics rose more than 4% each. Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 18%, Century Aluminum rallied 10% and Alcoa rose about 2%.

AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom climbed 2.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Amazon gained 1.7%.
