Chinese shares dropped as sentiment soured over more international tariffs being imposed on Chinese goods, particularly steel and aluminum.

The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.4%, or 13.90 points, to close Thursday's session at 3,332.48. The Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.8%, or 82.26 points, to 10,626.62.

The Indian government is looking at imposing a temporary tax of between 15% and 25% on Chinese steel as soon as six months to protect India's steel industry, Reuters reported Wednesday.

Steel Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said that cheap imports, including those from China, are a "serious challenge" to Indian manufacturers.

The news followed the White House's 25% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.

In corporate news, Jiangxi Mubang High-tech fell 5% after a court ordered the freezing of 1.1 million yuan worth of a subsidiary's bank account amid a sales contract dispute case.

Liaoning Chengda dropped nearly 5% as it faces changes in its controlling shareholder.

Moreover, China XD Electric closed over 4% lower after its unit, GE Smallworld (Singapore), said it will dispose up to 3% of its holdings in the electrical equipment manufacturer.
