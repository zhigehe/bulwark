South Korea's unemployment rate dropped sharply in January, highlighting how domestic political tensions have had minimal impact on the country's jobs market.

The unemployment rate dropped to 2.9% from 3.7% in December 2024, according to Friday data from Statistics Korea.

On the other hand, employment for those aged between 15 years old and 64 years old rose 0.1 percentage points to 68.8%.

The number of employed people exceeded the number of unemployed. About 135,000 people were employed, with the number of employed rising to 27.9 million people. The number of jobless people rose only by 11,000 to around 1.1 million people in January, the Statistics Bureau reported.

Public administration and health and social recorded the most hires among all industries, adding 65,000 people and 180,000 people, respectively.

"We found today's figures positive, as they suggest that the political upheavals in December had a minimal impact on the labor market," ING's South Korea and Japan senior economist, Min Joo Kang, said. "At the same time, it shows that the Korean labor market is heavily dependent on public programs, rather than the private sector."

South Korea's political landscape was shaken, especially in the first part of the year, after former President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, following the announcement of an emergency martial law.
