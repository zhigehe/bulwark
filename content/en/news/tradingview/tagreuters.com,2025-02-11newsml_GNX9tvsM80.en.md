XI’AN, CHINA, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Enlightify Inc. (“Enlightify” or the “Company” and formerly China Green Agriculture, Inc.) today announced that on Feb. 5, 2025, it has entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Gaintime Industry-Finance (Beijing) Venture Capital Fund Management Co., Ltd.  (“Gaintime Fund”), a prominent fund management company specializing in the new energy investments.

The collaboration will initially focus on renewable energy markets in Europe and Southeast Asia, with a portfolio of identified projects, including solar and wind power initiatives in Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Bosnia, and Romania. These projects, ranging from 30 MW to 287 MW in capacity, are at various stages of development, with several already securing necessary permits and approvals.
