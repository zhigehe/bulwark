Meta Platforms began a round of layoffs Monday that will see the company cut 5% of staff, or roughly 3,700 workers.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a memo last month that the layoffs would target low-performing employees.

"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster," Zuckerberg said at the time. He said the roles would be backfilled.

Meta has been going through a spate of changes. In January, the company rolled back some content-moderation practices and eliminated its team assigned to diversity.

In a recent all-hands, Zuckerberg told staff to prepare for an intense year.

The company's shares have surged by more than 15% in the last month, while a number of other big tech players including Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company, have lagged due to questions about ongoing costs of artificial-intelligence investments. Meta plans $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year, mostly on AI.
