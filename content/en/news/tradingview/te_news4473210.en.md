South Africa's 10-year government bond yield climbed toward 10.75%, its highest since early June 2024, amid rising tensions between the US and South Africa.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday, formalizing his earlier decision to freeze U.S. assistance over a contentious law permitting the government to expropriate farmland from ethnic minorities, particularly white farmers, without compensation in certain cases.

Trump also criticized South Africa’s position on Israel and the Gaza conflict.

In response, South African officials emphasized that the policy seeks to address the legacy of apartheid, which long prevented black South Africans from owning land.

Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa's annual speech on February 6th, the first under the new coalition government, focused on the government’s commitment to meeting its 3% GDP growth target and advancing its policy agenda while chairing the G20 this year.
