Growing global demand for U.S. ethanol is positioning the industry for continued success, but policy uncertainly clouds the market outlook, CoBank said. U.S. ethanol exports hit record levels last year, as domestic producers shipped more than 1.9 billion gallons abroad, CoBank said. Biofuel inclusion or blending rate policies in foreign markets will likely determine if strong exports will continue, CoBank said. The market may also be impacted by policy uncertainty at home and abroad. Jacqui Fatka, farm supply and biofuels economist with CoBank, said currently, the best opportunity to increase ethanol demand in 2025 remains in the export market. CoBank is a cooperative bank serving industries across rural America. (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)
