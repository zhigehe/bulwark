Bernstein analysts on Wednesday said the North Atlantic region remains the "best market" for airlines in Europe, prompting rating changes on two major names in the sector.

Deutsche Lufthansa was upgraded to outperform with a price target of 8 euros, while International Consolidated Airlines Group , or IAG, was lowered to market-perform with a price target of 3.50 pounds sterling.

Analysts said IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and more, is still "the quality play" but expensive, which provides an opportunity for its German rival.

"As the lower-margin airline, Lufthansa has more beta to industry health, and investors get about as much North Atlantic leverage as they do with IAG, for a lower multiple," the note said. "Lufthansa has leverage to the same strong North Atlantic market, and soft comps through the first half of the year."
