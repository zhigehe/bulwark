**About Alison Steinberg**

From professional Hollywood makeup artist to political pundit, Alison’s passion for patriotism pulled her out from behind the camera after gaining widespread attention with viral videos that resonated with millions. Her boldness and desire to speak out on topics that were once considered unpopular, led to an opportunity which allowed Alison to host her own national news talk show. Alison continues to inform and inspire her audience as she seeks to unveil the truth in a witty and captivating manner.

White House Correspondent Alison Steinberg said, “God has mysterious ways of guiding our paths! After several personal struggles, and a move across the country, I continued to seek the Lord’s guidance for the next chapter in my life. I was recently connected with Mike Lindell who offered to have me join his team at Lindell TV. I’m so honored to announce that I will now be on the ground, giving live news updates from D.C. In this era of fake news, I’m eager and excited to bring truth and shine light into the darkness!”
