Elite UK REIT's distribution per unit is expected to return to a growth trajectory, according to DBS Group Research analysts, raising the REIT's rating to buy from hold and increasing its target price to GBP0.36 from GBP0.25. The REIT is projected to post DPU growth over next two years, the analysts say, citing wider net property income margins primarily due to lower vacancy costs and higher interest savings. In addition, the REIT plans to explore repurposing some of its vacant assets for alternative uses, such as student accommodation, which is currently undersupplied in the U.K. This presents an opportunity for the REIT to capitalize on emerging trends in the living sector, the analysts add. Units are unchanged at GBP0.31. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
