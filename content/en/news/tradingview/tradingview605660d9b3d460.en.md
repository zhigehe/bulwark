A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc., a leading full-service precious metals trading company, has released its Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and operational highlights, reflecting its strategic initiatives and market conditions.

**Financial Highlights**

**Revenues:** A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. reported revenues of $2,742.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, marking a significant increase from $2,078.8 million in the same period of 2023. This growth was driven by higher sales volumes and favorable market conditions.

**Gross Profit:** The company's gross profit for the quarter was $44.8 million, compared to $46.0 million in the same period of 2023. The slight decrease was attributed to increased cost of sales.

**Net Income:** Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2024, was $6.6 million, down from $13.8 million in the same period of 2023. The decline was primarily due to higher operating expenses and depreciation.

**Basic Net Income Per Share:** Basic net income per share was $0.28 for the quarter, compared to $0.60 in the same period of 2023, reflecting the decrease in net income.

**Diluted Net Income Per Share:** Diluted net income per share was $0.27 for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.57 in the same period of 2023, consistent with the decline in net income.
