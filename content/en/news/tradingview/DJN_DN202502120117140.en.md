The opening of Churchill Downs' Owensboro racing and gaming venue represents its seventh horse racing entertainment investment in Kentucky as the company takes advantage of its privileged position in the state. The investment made by the Louisville, Ky.-based company, known for its Kentucky Derby race and casinos, stood at $100 million as planned, and was completed on time. CEO Bill Carstanjen says the expansion is part of its plan to expand its footprint in western Kentucky. The company didn't provide details about additional expansion plans in the region or outside of it. Shares fall 0.5% to $121.21. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)
