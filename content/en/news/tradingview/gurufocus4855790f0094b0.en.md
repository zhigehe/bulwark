Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Grok 3, the latest version of his AI chatbot developed by xAI, is in its final development stages and will be released in one to two weeks. Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk claimed that Grok 3 surpasses all existing AI chatbots in reasoning capabilities.

In the tests we've done so far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that's been released, Musk stated, adding that the model analyzes its own mistakes to improve accuracy. The AI will compete with ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google DeepMind), Claude (Anthropic), Mistral AI, and Meta's (META) Llama.

Musk also criticized Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI, accusing it of shifting from a nonprofit to a profit-driven model. His remarks follow a $97.4 billion bid from a Musk-led group to acquire OpenAI's nonprofit entity. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, has since sued the company, claiming it prioritizes profit over benefiting humanity.
