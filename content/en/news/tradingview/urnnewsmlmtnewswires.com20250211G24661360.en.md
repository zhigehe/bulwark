Kering said Tuesday its net income and revenue for 2024 fell year over year.

Net income attributable to the group for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 1.13 billion euros, compared with 2.98 billion euros earlier. EPS moved to 9.24 euros from 24.37 euros.

The luxury goods company's revenue was 17.19 billion euros, compared with 19.57 billion euros a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 17.05 billion euros in sales, 1.32 billion euros in net income, and 10.76 euros in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board proposed a final dividend of 4 euros per share, payable May 7 to shareholders on record May 6. It paid a previous final dividend of 9.50 euros per share. This takes the full-year dividend to 6 euros per share, down from 14 euros in the previous year.
