The Norwegian economy shrank by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to December 2024, following a downwardly revised 1.6% contraction in the previous period.

This marked the second straight quarter of contraction, primarily driven by a decline in petroleum activities and ocean transport (-1.0% vs -5.8% in Q3).

Net trade contributed positively to GDP, as exports edged up 0.1% (vs -3.2% in Q2), while imports declined by 0.7% (vs 3.5%).

Meanwhile, growth in government spending slowed (0.3% vs 0.6%), and household consumption stagnated (0% vs -0.2%).

On the other hand, fixed investment growth slowed (0.2% vs 1.6%).

Year-on-year, Norwegian GDP contracted by 0.3%, reversing from an upwardly revised 3.7% expansion in the previous quarter.
