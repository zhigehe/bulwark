Blink Charging Co. (BLNK, Financials) announced that its subsidiary, Envoy Technologies, filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering.

It is currently unknown the quantity of shares to be sold as well as the price policies.

Provider of community-based electric vehicle car-sharing programs Envoy has registered common stock under the ticker EVOY on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Market circumstances and SEC examination still determine the offering.

Although the registration statement has been filed, it is not yet effective so the securities cannot be sold or offered until permission is received. Blink said the release does not represent an offer to sell or solicit sales and respects Rule 135 of the Securities Act of 1933.

Based in Culver City, California, Envoy provides all-electric car-sharing services to private buildings including offices, hotels, and residential complexes. The business works with real estate owners to include EV-sharing initiatives meant to lower parking demand and support sustainability.

Traded under the Nasdaq ticker BLNK, Blink Charging runs an EV charging network and supplies charging tools and services for municipal, commercial, and household sites. By means of strategic alliances and national implementation, the corporation keeps increasing the acceptance of EVs, according to a statement.
