Russia's Nornickel , a major world producer of refined nickel and palladium, said on Tuesday it is in active talks on a joint venture in China.

It did not give further details of the talks.

Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters in December that Nornickel and Chinese conglomerate Xiamen C&D were in discussions to create a JV in China to process Nornickel's copper raw material into metal.

Nornickel also repeated on Tuesday that it plans to sell its entire production in 2025.

The company said on Monday it saw a global nickel surplus of 150,000 tons in 2025 and expected the global palladium market to be in balance this year.
