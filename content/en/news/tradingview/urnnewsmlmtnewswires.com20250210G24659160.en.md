Lycopodium was granted a AU$5.4 million award for the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for a plant at the Kalgoorlie nickel project-Goongarrie Hub in Western Australia, owned by Ardea Resources , according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

It was awarded the study for the design engineering of a hydrogen sulfide plant for the development of the project.

The study is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025 and drilling is ongoing on-site to define the measured mineral resource.

Its shares rose a little over 1% in early trading on Tuesday.
