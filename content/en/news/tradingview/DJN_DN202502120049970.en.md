Base metal prices are mixed, with LME three-month copper up 0.3% at $9,387 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum down 0.9% at $2,615.50 a ton. Tariff pressures are building for the U.S. economy, BMI says, which could pressure industrial metal demand lower. President Trump's 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports could prompt further escalations, it notes. Further tariffs, including the proposed blanket Mexican and Canadian tariffs, could also strengthen the Midwest premium and widen the price difference between U.S. and LME prices. Tariffs will help boost domestic steel production, but it will be a challenge to significantly increase output, BMI writes. The U.S. aluminum industry isn't globally competitive given high costs, and imports account for around 50% of total demand, suggesting significant pass-through effects, BMI adds.
