Cardiogeni (CGNI.AQ) signed a memorandum of understanding with the private office of Sheikh Al Qassimi for a 20 million-pound-sterling investment to fund its novel heart failure medicines' trials in the United Arab Emirates.

The funding will be spread from 2025 to 2027 through a joint venture with 5 million pounds coming through an initial investment in the first half of 2025, the British clinical-stage biotechnology company said on Monday.

The non-binding joint venture will oversee research, development, manufacturing, and Phase 2b/3 clinical trials across the Gulf Cooperation Council and a legally binding agreement is expected by March 31.
