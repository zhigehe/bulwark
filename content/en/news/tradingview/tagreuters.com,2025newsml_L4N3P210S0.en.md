\*\* Drug developer Biohaven's shares rise 8.50% to $41.50 premarket

\*\* Co [says](https://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250211:nPnsctV5a&default-theme=true) the FDA on Tuesday granted priority review status to the firm's marketing application for the drug troriluzole to treat spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)

\*\* 'Priority review' status is assigned to drugs that offer a significant improvement over other available treatments for a specific disorder or would provide a treatment option where none exists

\*\* Co's application to the FDA is based on data from a real-world study in which troriluzole helped improve symptoms of the disease over three years

\*\* BHVN's drug also slowed progression of the disease by 50%-70% vs placebo, according to the data

\*\* William Blair analysts said this rate of decline represents a delay of 1.5-2.2 years in disease progression for SCA patients

\*\* SCA is a rare, genetic, life-threatening neurodegenerative disease, which affects a part of the brain vital to coordination of physical movement

\*\* Co expects to receive a decision from the FDA during Q3Â 2025

\*\* In the last 12 months, stock has fallen 20.54%
