CARLSBAD, Calif., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Upper Deck, the worldwide leader in sports and entertainment collectibles and memorabilia, expands its agreement with legendary ice hockey player Bobby Orr as an exclusive spokesperson. Orr has been a long-time exclusive spokesperson for Upper Deck’s trading cards and has now broadened that exclusivity to cover all collectibles and memorabilia.

The two-time Stanley Cup champion utilized his elite skating and playmaking abilities to become a generational offensive threat, and he is still the only defenseman to win the Art Ross trophy as the NHL’s scoring leader on two separate occasions. Not to be outdone at the other end of the ice, Orr also won the Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman eight years in a row.

“Bobby Orr revolutionized the game of hockey from one end of the rink to the other, and we’re fortunate to deepen our existing relationship with him as an exclusive spokesperson,” said Jason Masherah, president of Upper Deck. “It’s been nearly 50 years since he hung up his skates, yet he remains a household name for any generation of hockey fan; that makes Orr one of the most special athletes to play in the NHL. We are honored to showcase his career and help collectors celebrate his legacy through all collectibles and memorabilia.”

Bobby Orr’s memorabilia collection highlights his decorated career and includes authentic autographed prints, high-end portfolio featuring Tegata and “The Show”, the revolutionary “Breaking Through,” autographed Boston Bruins jerseys, and more. Fans can add two brand-new prints to their collection that represent Orr’s incredible achievements on the ice. “Skating For Country” celebrates the only time Orr ever played for Team Canada in 1976 and won the MVP title, while “Excellence Redefined” exalts his long-standing career and cultural impact on the game.

“I’m honored to be an exclusive athlete with Upper Deck and I’m thrilled to be on the same team as Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Tiger Woods, and Kerri Walsh Jennings,” said Orr. “This is very special.”

Fans can collect Bobby Orr’s trading cards and memorabilia at Upper Deck’s Certified Diamond Dealer hobby shops and on the Upper Deck website. To view the entire memorabilia collection, visit UpperDeckStore.com.
