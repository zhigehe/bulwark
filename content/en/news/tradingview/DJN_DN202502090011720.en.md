The U.S. dollar strengthens against most other G-10 and Asian currencies in the morning session. U.S. President Trump said he plans to impose 25% tariffs Monday on imports of steel and aluminum, which could spur demand for the greenback as a safe-haven asset. The USD Index has maintained its recovery, analysts at CIMB Treasury and Markets Research say in a report. The upcoming tariffs are likely to focus on the European Union given its relatively high trade surplus with the U.S., as well as the region's higher tariffs against U.S. exports, the analysts add. The USD Index is 0.3% higher at 108.36; USD/JPY gains 0.5% to 152.11. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
