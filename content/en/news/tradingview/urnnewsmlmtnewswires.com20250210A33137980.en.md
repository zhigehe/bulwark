National Bank of Canada on Monday adjusted its price target on Chorus Aviation to $26 from $3.75 to reflect the company completing its one-for-seven share consolidation while maintaining its outperform rating on the shares.

"With the recent completion of the sale of Chorus' leasing business and subsequent deleveraging transactions, the company is a much simpler business that should be a steady generator of free cash flow with shareholder value generation through ongoing share buybacks and potentially acquisitions in the aviation services sector," said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

The share consolidation resulted in new shares outstanding of about 26.9 million.
