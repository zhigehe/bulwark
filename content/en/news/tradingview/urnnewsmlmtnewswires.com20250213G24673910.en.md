Commerzbank signed up Visa as its preferred partner for debit and credit cards.

The German bank announced the strategic long-term partnership on Thursday, adding that its Girocards will be equipped with the Visa debit function for the first time.

Under the agreement, Commerzbank's customers will preferentially receive Visa cards in the future and the partners will work closely together in payment security.

In retail banking, the company's customers are expected to receive new Visa debit and credit cards starting in 2026.
