Dallas, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Along with Atmos Energy’s vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services is also to be recognized for being a great employer, and for the fifth consecutive year the company has done just that. Today Atmos Energy was recognized as a leading employer in the U.S. and in the utilities industry when it was named to the Forbes “America’s Best Employers” list. Key to this honor is the company’s unique culture, AtmoSpirit, which fosters innovation and engagement through the meaningful contributions of a workforce with a wide variety of skills, talents, backgrounds, and experiences that reflect the 1,400 communities they serve.

“This honor is a testament to the focus and dedication of all 5,300 employees who *Make a Difference* and *Bring Out the Best in Others* each and every day in the communities we serve,” said Matt Robbins, senior vice president of human resources for Atmos Energy. “AtmoSpirit has been the foundation of our enduring success and deeply rooted safety culture for over 25 years, and we will continue to embrace those core principles as we remain focused on our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services and to be recognized as a great employer for our teammates in the 1,400 communities we are honored to serve.”

Forbes and Statista selected “America’s Best Employers 2025” through an independent survey from a sample of more than 217,000 U.S. employees working for companies employing at least 1,000 people within the U.S. The final scores are based on two types of evaluations: personal (those given by employees themselves) and public (those given by friends and family members of employees, or members of the public who work in the same industry), with a much higher weighting for personal evaluations.

From a total of 701 large organizations with at least 5,000 employees, Atmos Energy ranks in the top 40 percent overall and eighth among all companies in the utility industry.
