Johnson & Johnson said on Thursday it will discontinue a late-stage study of an experimental E.coli vaccine it was developing in partnership with Sanofi .

The drugmaker said its decision was based on the recommendation of an independent committee that found the vaccine candidate may not be sufficiently effective compared with a placebo in preventing infections caused by a group of bacteria commonly found in the gut.

No safety signals related to the experimental vaccine were identified, J&J said, adding that it was conducting follow-ups for participants currently enrolled in the trial.

The study was testing the safety and efficacy of a single dose of the experimental shot, ExPEC9V, in preventing E.coli disease, including sepsis and blood infections.
