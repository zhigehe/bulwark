Daiwa Capital Markets noted that eurozone industrial production (IP) for December will be released on Thursday at 5 a.m. ET while Q4 gross domestic product will be published on Friday at 5.m. ET.

IP data for December will highlight how the factory sector continued to weigh significantly on economic activity at the end of 2024, noted the bank. Reflecting particular weakness in Germany, Daiwa thinks aggregate eurozone IP declined about 0.75% month over month in December, to leave it down around 0.5% quarter over quarter in Q4.

As a result, the bank also estimates the updated estimate of Q4 GDP to confirm the initial estimate of zero growth.
