Swiss testing and certification company SGS on Tuesday reported full year sales in line with forecasts and slightly better than expected profit.

The company, which last month ended talks about a potential $30 billion merger with French rival Bureau Veritas , said its annual sales increased 2.6% to 6.79 billion Swiss francs ($7.45 billion).

The figure matched forecasts in a consensus of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha, while adjusted operating income increased by 7.1% to 1.04 billion francs, slightly above the 1.02 billion francs expected.

Testing, inspection and certification companies (TIC) have been benefiting from the rise in interest around topics like sustainability, as well companies wanting to ensure the quality of components they get from their supply chains.

Geneva-based SGS, the largest player in the global TIC market, said it expected to increase its sales by 5-7% in 2025, when the impact of currency movements were removed.

It said it also wanted to add 1-2 % in sales from acquisitions, and continue to improve its profit margin.

SGS has already bought three companies in 2025 in addition to the 11 it bought during 2024 as it resumed its acquisitions programme.
