In January, 3.5 million passengers used Avinor's airports. This is an increaseof nine percent compared to January 2024. The largest increase is amonginternational travelers, with the number of travelers rising by 13 percent.Thenumber of domestic travelers is six percent higher than in January last year.

"The start of the year has shown strong development, with the number ofinternational trips being the main driver. The growth in the number ofinternational travelers is influenced by the significant increase in tourismtoNorway as a winter destination. Norway is increasingly standing out as anattractive destination in the international competition for winter tourism,"explains Gaute Skallerud Riise.

Christian Lunde from VisitOSLO also has figures from the Oslo region thatconfirm this development: "In 2024, we experienced a surprising interest andgrowth from the international market. Norway has been put on the map througheverything from northern lights tourism to exciting cities to visit. In 2024,Oslo saw a 15 percent increase in international overnight stays, and 40percentof all overnight stays were international. In the last months of the yearalone,international growth was 28 percent in October, 34 percent in November, and 26percent in December for the Oslo region compared to 2023.

We are experiencing that winter tourism to Oslo and Norway is a trend thatwillstrengthen. More direct routes and a perceived 'exotic' climate are importantdriving forces, in addition to high quality throughout the visitor industry,"says Christian Lunde, CEO of VisitOSLO.

Fuller Flights and More CargoThere were 47,289 aircraft movements in January. This is about three thousandmore than in January 2024, an increase of six percent. At the same time, thenumber of passengers increased by nine percent. "This leads to a higher loadfactor on the planes, which is positive for the utilization of flight capacityin the Norwegian market," continues Gaute Skallerud Riise.

"In 2024, cargo on incoming long-haul passenger flights increased by a full 71percent. The trend of more cargo continues in January. At Oslo Airport, therewas an increase of five percent in January compared to January 2024. Animportant driver for the development over the past year has been the increaseinincoming cargo on international passenger flights. This contributes to bettereconomics for airlines at Oslo Airport, as well as better utilization ofcapacity in the market," concludes Gaute Skallerud Riise.

Greatest Growth for the Smaller AirportsIt is the regional airports (DRL) that had the largest percentage growth inJanuary, with an increase of 17 percent. The major airports (Oslo, Bergen,Trondheim, and Stavanger) also increased, but for them, the total passengergrowth was seven percent in January compared to January last year.

50 Percent More Drone Flights in JanuaryIn January, 1,456 drone flights were reported in Ninox Drone."This is anincrease of more than 50 percent compared to January 2024," says MatsGjertsen,who leads Avinor's drone program. "These are high numbers in a month withgenerally lower drone activity, and it is a sign of clearly increased use ofdrones in Norway," says Gjertsen.
