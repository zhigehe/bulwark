Osotspa faces earnings hit from some new headwinds, Thanachart Securities' Pattadol Bunnak says in a research report. Its strategy to reintroduce a THB10/bottle energy drink in Thailand may cannibalize its own market share of existing THB12/bottle version and is unlikely to lead to imminent market-share gains since its rival's product costs THB10/bottle. Other worries are an expected income-tax increase stemming from the global minimum tax and more competition in Myanmar, the analyst adds. The brokerage slashes its earnings estimates for the Thailand beverage producer by 17% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and 35% in 2027. It cuts the stock's rating to sell from buy and the target price to THB13.00 from THB26.00. Shares closed 3.3% lower at THB14.70 on Monday. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
