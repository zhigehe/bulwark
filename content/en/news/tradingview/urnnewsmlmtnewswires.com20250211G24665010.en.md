Global Lithium Resources said Australia's Takeovers Panel declined to proceed with a review application on an alleged undisclosed association among some shareholders, according to a Tuesday filing with the Australian bourse.

The alleged undisclosed association involved shareholders holding 30-40% shares, including director Dianmin Chen, ahead of a Feb. 13 AGM on board composition, per the filing.

The panel ruled the application was filed beyond the two-month limit and was thus declined, the filing stated.

Company shares were down 7% in recent trade.
