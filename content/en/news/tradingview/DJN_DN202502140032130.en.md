Taiwan is a potential target for reciprocal and semiconductor levies as Trump's tariff threats escalate, DBS's Ma Tieying says in a note. The senior economist estimates a hit of up to 0.9 percentage point to the island's GDP growth if such tariffs are imposed. However, Taiwan could mitigate the impact through bilateral negotiations, such as by reducing its import tariff rates on American goods, increasing imports of U.S. agricultural products, energy and automobiles, as well as boosting semiconductor investments in the U.S., she says. "A fiscal policy response is more likely, with targeted support for industries and companies negatively impacted by tariffs." DBS maintains its forecast for Taiwan's economy to grow 3.0% this year.
