Contact Energy said it will be included in the MSCI New Zealand Index effective as of close on Feb. 28, according to a Wednesday bourse filings in Australia and New Zealand.

The MSCI New Zealand Index is designed to measure the performance of the large and mid-cap segments of the New Zealand market. It covers around 85% of the country's free-float-adjusted market capitalization, the filing said.

The firm's shares rose 2% in recent trade on the Australian bourse.
