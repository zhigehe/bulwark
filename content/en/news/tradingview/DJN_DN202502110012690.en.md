M.J. Gleeson's pretax profit plunged 50% in the second half of the year amid challenging market conditions.

The London-listed low-cost housebuilder and land promoter said Tuesday that its pretax profit declined to 3.6 million pounds ($4.5 million) in the six months to Dec. 31.

Revenue grew 4.2% to 157.85 million pounds, while the group's operating profit plunged 42% to 5.1 million pounds.

The net reservation rate rose to 0.55 per site per week for that half year from 0.41 the year prior.

The company completed the sale of 801 homes, and is making good progress against its growth strategy, opening 8 new build sites and 11 new sales outlets, Chief Executive Graham Prothero said.

M.J. Gleeson added it is seeing encouraging signs of a recovery in demand, including a 45% increase in net reservation rates in January.

The market should continue to recover helped by further interest rate cuts, Prothero said, but cautioned that the timing and trajectory of that recovery remains uncertain.

The board declared an interim dividend of 4 pence a share.
