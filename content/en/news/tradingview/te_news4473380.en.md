Platinum futures rose to $1,020 per ounce, approaching the three-month high of $1,032 touched on January 31st and rising more than 12% since the start of the year, the rally for bullion as stronger demand for safety and looser monetary policy by major central banks momentarily offset the slowing demand.

Precious metals soared after US President Trump expanded on earlier tariff threats by including restrictions on steel and aluminum, in addition to matching tariffs from any current restriction on the US. On the policy front, expectations of lower rates by the Fed, RCB, PBoC, and the RBI also lifted yield-less assets.

Still, slowing demand for internal combustion engines, which take platinum as inputs through their catalytic converter, limited the rebound.

This was lastly evidenced as more than 60% of purchases under Chinaâ€™s subsidized new vehicle exchange program were for vehicles with a plug.
