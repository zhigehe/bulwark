US stock futures were little changed on Wednesday as investors braced for the release of the latest consumer inflation data.

On Tuesday, in regular trading, the Dow and S&P 500 saw modest gains of 0.28% and 0.03%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.36%.

These mixed results came amid growing concerns over President Trump’s blanket 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising fears of a broader trade war.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his cautious stance before the Senate Banking Committee, stating that the Fed has no immediate plans to cut interest rates further, citing a resilient economy and persistent inflation that remains above the 2% target.

Looking ahead, investors are focused on the release of the January CPI report and Powell’s testimony before the House of Representatives.

In addition, earnings reports are expected from major companies including Cisco Systems, CVS Health, Kraft Heinz, MGM Resorts, and Robinhood.
