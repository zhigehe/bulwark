Growing trade headwinds are poised to bear down on Shein's potential London initial public offering, with the fast-fashion giant set to slash its target valuation to about $50 billion, nearly 25% lower than its 2023 fundraising value, Reuters reported Feb. 7.

The drop comes as the US ends the "de minimis" duty exemption, a key policy that allowed Shein to avoid import taxes and keep prices low, according to the report.

With the US as Shein's largest market, analysts warn the policy shift could hurt profits and drive up prices, impacting IPO prospects, Reuters wrote.

Shein previously abandoned a US IPO amid scrutiny over labor practices and competition lawsuits, according to the report.

A source said the UK government remains eager for the listing, but the UK's Financial Conduct Authority is taking longer than expected to sign off on the IPO, Reuters wrote.
