Nestle reported a better-than-expected performance in 2024 but warned of pressures on its margins in 2025, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says in a note. The company is dealing with a sharp increase in cocoa and coffee prices, the key ingredients for its core products, he says. Raising product prices to pass on such cost increases could be dangerous, Mould adds. Hence, the guidance for lower margins in 2025 implies that Nestle is "going to stomach some of the pain itself", he adds. Shares are up 6.2% at 83.68 Swiss francs. (michael.susin@wsj.com)
