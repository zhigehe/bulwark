Minera Alamos over the weekend filed an early warning report pursuant to the provisions of Canadian securities legislation in connection with the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Sabre Gold Mines (SGLD.TO) by way of a plan of arrangement.

A statement noted that Minera bought near 110.4 million common shares of Sabre, being all of their issued and outstanding common shares of Sabre pursuant to the arrangement. Prior to the completion, Minera did not own any common shares of Sabre. Accordingly, the acquisition represents an increase in Minera's beneficial ownership and control of common shares of Sabre from 0% to 100%, the statement said.

Shares of MAI closed down $0.005 or 1.5%, to $0.335 on Friday on the TSX Venture Exchange.
