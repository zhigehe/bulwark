Key points:

* Gold stocks scale fresh peak
* Lithium stocks fall on reports of CATL restarting production
* Nine Entertainment top gainer on ASX 200

Australian shares ended flat on Tuesday, as a late drag in healthcare major CSL offset the rally in gold stocks, media giant Nine Entertainment and Macquarie amid caution over U.S. tariffs and mixed corporate earnings.

The benchmark index S&P/ASX 200 ended little changed at 8,484 points. On Monday, it closed 0.3% lower.

Financial conglomerate Macquarie Group gained 1.6% after remaining on track to meet its annual outlook and market estimates.

Australian media firm Nine Entertainment finished 14% higher to be the top gainer on the benchmark index after rival Seven West Media , which ended 6.1% higher, hinted that the local advertising market was finally turning.

Gold stocks rallied 2.7% to a fresh high, tracking strong bullion, driven by safe-haven demand as U.S. President Donald Trump significantly increased tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 25% on Monday.

Gold miners Northern Star Resources and St Barbara added 4% and 5.8%, respectively.

Capping the gains, local lithium stocks tumbled on news that battery maker CATL restarted production at a refinery in China, further threatening price recovery for the key battery metal.

Sector majors IGO fell 4.3% and Mineral Resources shed 6.9%.

Healthcare stocks dropped 2.9% after sub-index heavyweight CSL's first-half profit missed estimates. The stock ended 5% lower.

Miners added 0.2%.

Commenting on the miners' corporate earnings, which will begin next week, Grady Wulff, market analyst at Bell Direct, said, "The earnings potential and growth of our mining sector in the iron ore, steel and aluminium markets will face the full brunt of tariffs if they are introduced in Australia."

Top iron ore producer Rio Tinto , BHP and Fortescue will report their earnings next week.

New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained 0.3% to 12,917.45 points.
