VAL-D’OR, Quebec, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **Cartier Resources Inc.** (″**Cartier**″ or the ″**Company**″) (TSXV: ECR; FSE:6CA) is pleased to announce it intends to evaluate the economic potential of reprocessing Chimo Tailings (″**Chimo Tailings Project**″), located on the Cadillac Project.

The Chimo Tailings Project consist of waste materials from the past producing Chimo Mine, which operated intermittently from 1964 to 1997 and produced 379,012 ounces of gold (MERN DV 85-05 to DV 97-01).

Located near the Val-d’Or mining camp and existing gold mills with available capacity, the Chimo Tailings Project can potentially unlock value through tailings reprocessing, with low capital requirements and a favourable gold price environment.

Mr. Philippe Cloutier, President and CEO, stated: ″As announced earlier this month, as part of our ambitious plan to grow our resources, we believe that initiating this economic evaluation of reprocessing the tailings of the past producing Chimo Mine can be one of many exciting opportunities with significant upside potential for Cartier’s shareholders″.

In the next months, Cartier plans to conduct a tailings characterization program to determine the amount of gold that can extracted from the tailings site.

Simultaneously, Cartier advances with its plan to execute a multi-stage and 100,000-m drilling program, based on 3 key elements:

* Apply innovative AI (Artificial Intelligence) exploration tools for target generation.
* Review of the current mineral resource estimate and geological interpretation to develop a value-based targeting and development approach at the property scale.
* Traditional targeting with focus on 2024 high-grade gold discoveries as well as best untested historical showings.
