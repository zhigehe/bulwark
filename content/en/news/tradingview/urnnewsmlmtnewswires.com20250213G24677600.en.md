Elliott Management is urging BP (BP.L) to boost its performance and make certain divestments after building up a 5% stake in the oil major, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.

The activist investor is pushing for the sale of some assets in the low-carbon sector, among other businesses, the source said, adding that Elliott is not seeking higher oil and gas investments or a merger, and is supportive of BP's independent strategy.

BP did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
