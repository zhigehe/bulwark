Obayashi profit attributable to owners of the parent surged 101.2% to 95.5 billion yen in the fiscal nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024 from 47.4 billion yen a year ago due to higher operating income and extraordinary income.

The construction firm said ordinary income was a result of earlier-than-expected cross-shareholdings sale.

Earnings per share (EPS) rose to 94.84 yen from 47.42 yen a year ago, according to a statement on Monday.

Sales revenue increased 10.6% to 1.88 trillion yen from 1.70 trillion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filling, Obayashi raised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 due to increased contract completion, and favourable foreign currency translation.

It forecasted attributable profit of 128.0 billion yen or 178.69 yen per share (from 87 billion yen or 121.35 yen per share) and net sales of 2.61 trillion yen (from 2.51 trillion yen).

It declared an interim dividend of 42 yen per share and plans to pay a total annual dividend of 80 yen per share for the fiscal year.

It also plans a 30.0 billion yen share buyback programme, set to be completed by June 30, 2025, as part of a planned 100.0 billion yen repurchase by the end of fiscal 2026.

Obayashi shares gained nearly 3% at market close.
