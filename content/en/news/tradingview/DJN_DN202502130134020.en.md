Evolus said the Food and Drug Administration approved its injectable hyaluronic acid gels, known as Evolysse Form and Evolysse Smooth, in line with management expectations.

The dermatological-beauty company on Thursday said that the approval marks its entry into the hyaluronic acid dermal filler market and expands its total addressable market by 78%, to about $6 billion.

The commercial launch of the injectables in the U.S. market is planned for the second quarter of the year, and would be followed by the launches of injectables Evolysse Sculpt and Evolysse Lips in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

Evolus shares are up 32% year to date to a total market capitalization of about $903 million, after the company reported a jump in revenue for the fourth quarter and full year, topping company guidance.

The Newport Beach, Calif., company expects revenue of $345 million to $355 million in 2025, representing growth of 30% to 33% when compared with its 2024 results.

Evolus forecasts revenue of at least $700 million by 2028.
