Palm oil prices rise in early Asian trading. Concerns about limited supply are bolstering the market, AmInvestment Bank says in a note. It anticipate prices will rise further, testing the MYR4,600/ton-MYR4,650/ton resistance level before profit-taking sets in after a three-day rally. Any price pullback could present an opportunity to enter long positions, it adds. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board's Jan. supply and demand data is expected this afternoon. AmInvestment Bank pegs CPO support at 4,395 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,549 ringgit/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 18 ringgit higher at 4,522 ringgit/ton.
