Hong Kong stocks continued their winning streak to begin the week in green, rising on Monday led by tech firms as China anticipates support measures to tackle US tariffs.

The Hang Seng Index surged 1.84%, or 388.44 points, to end at 21,521.98. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index added 2.09%, or 162.74 points, to 7,946.81.

Chinese technology giants extended gains into the new week, as optimism fueled by the ongoing global interest in Deepseek continued to run high.

Tech giants Xiaomi and Tencent rose 3% and 2%, respectively, with e-commerce firm Alibaba Group and food delivery company Meituan surging nearly 6% on Monday.

Investor sentiment remained upbeat amid hope for support measures to bolster the economy despite the announcement of a new 25% tariff by the US on the import of all steel and aluminum imports into the country.

To further boost sentiment, China saw its consumer price index (CPI) for January rise by 0.5% year over year, the fastest pace in five months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.

The CPI growth, which indicates strengthening consumer demand, surpassed the 0.4% growth forecast by Reuters-polled economists.

The positive CPI data overshadowed the 2.3% year-over-year drop in the producer price index (PPI), the same as the December figure, hinting at ongoing challenges in the manufacturing sector.
