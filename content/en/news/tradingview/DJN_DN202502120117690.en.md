WINNIPEG, Manitoba--Intercontinental Exchange canola futures closed lower on Wednesday only for the fourth time in the last 20 sessions.

The pressure from losses in the Chicago soy complex and European rapeseed was too much for canola despite support from gains in Malaysian palm oil. Declines in crude oil added to the downturn in most vegetable oils.

A trader noted that Canada's tight canola supply situation will limit how far its futures can go down. He said farmers are well sold on their canola carried over from last year and are waiting on higher prices for this year's harvest.

The May canola contract remained handily above its major moving averages, further underpinning canola values.

The Canadian dollar was slightly higher on Wednesday afternoon with the loonie at 69.98 U.S. cents compared to Tuesday's close of 69.90.

There were 71,351 contracts traded on Wednesday, compared to 72,913 on Tuesday. Spreading accounted for 48,386 contracts traded.

Prices are in Canadian dollars per metric tonne:
