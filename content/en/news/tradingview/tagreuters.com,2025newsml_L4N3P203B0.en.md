CONTEXT NEWS

A group of investors led by Elon Musk has submitted a $97.4 billion offer to acquire the non-profit that controls OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT.

Musk, the CEO of automaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, co-founded OpenAI with current boss Sam Altman in 2015. Musk departed the artificial intelligence firm in 2018. He has since sued OpenAI, Altman and fellow founder Greg Brockman in a lawsuit that charges the company with “perfidy and deceit” of “Shakespearean proportions.”
