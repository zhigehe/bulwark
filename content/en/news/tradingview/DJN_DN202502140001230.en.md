China isn't an obvious target for reciprocal tariffs, but that doesn't mean Beijing can breathe a sigh of relief, Capital Economics says. On the commonly used most-favored-nation tariff schedules, China's average tariff rate on U.S. imports is 4.1% higher than vice versa, but this excludes tariffs imposed since the first trade war, economist Julian Evans-Pritchard writes. "Adjusting for that, we estimate that China's average tariff rate on U.S. imports is actually 7.5% lower than in the other direction." Reciprocal tariffs highlight how serious Trump is about reducing the trade deficit--not just in terms of tariff rates, but also regarding tax regimes, non-tariff barriers and exchange rate policies, he says. The broad set of criteria suggests ample scope to justification for further tariffs on China. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
