Chiome Bioscience said research on its Tribody cancer immunotherapy, conducted in collaboration with Italy's Ceinge-Biotecnologie Avanzate, has been published in Cell Death Discovery, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The study examined multi-specific antibody Tribody that integrates immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-L1, PD-1, and LAG3 with a T cell engager targeting tumor-associated antigen 5T4.

Preclinical data showed that monotherapy with Chiome's candidate, PTRY, induced stronger T cell activation and anti-tumor effects in mice compared with combination therapy with a bi-specific antibody and clinically validated checkpoint inhibitors.
