The 2025 outlook for Shakey's Pizza Asia Ventures still seems positive, Maybank Securities' Daphne Sze says in a research report. This year's earnings drivers for the Philippine full-service restaurant chain operator include forecast stable same-store-sales growth of 2%, the addition of 176 new stores and cost savings, the analyst says. The brokerage reiterates the stock's buy rating owing to a potential recovery of discretionary spending and purchasing power in the Philippines as inflation slows. However, the brokerage trims the target price to PHP10.00 from PHP12.00 to reflect recent consumer weakness in the Philippines. Shares are 1.0% lower at PHP7.90. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
