The Indian rupee strengthened for the second session on Tuesday, reaching 86.8 per USD, amid bets of continued intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

On Monday, the central bank reportedly sold between $4 billion and $7 billion to stabilize the currency after it fell to record lows, nearing the 88 mark.

According to Reuters, traders believed the RBI continued its intervention Tuesday, helping the rupee reclaim levels above 87.

Despite the recovery, the rupee remains one of Asiaâ€™s worst-performing currencies year-to-date, due to foreign portfolio outflows and sluggish domestic economic growth.

Meantime, US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports for all countries, effective March 4, raising fears of trade disruptions that could weigh on global demand and pressure emerging-market currencies, including the rupee.

The RBI cut repo rates last week to support the economy but lower rates can weigh on the rupee by reducing returns on local assets.
