President Trump's latest tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. will likely have a small direct impact on the global economy since the metals account for a tiny share of world trade, according to Capital Economics. Canada's economy is relatively exposed, and U.S. steel prices will likely rise, economists led by Jennifer McKeown say in a commentary. The impact on China's economy will be negligible, as the U.S. already has high tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, they say. Given the limited trade, the incremental impact of additional tariffs should be small, the economists add. The bigger picture is that, with broader reciprocal levies also on the table, tariffs are still set to drive U.S. inflation higher and weigh on global growth this year, Capital Economics says.
