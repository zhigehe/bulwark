Enechange has agreed to a capital and business partnership with Itochu Enex , issuing 7.4 million new shares through a third-party allotment, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The move aims to strengthen its financial foundation and accelerate growth in its core energy businesses.

The partnership follows Enechange's plan to transfer its EV charging business into a joint venture with Chubu Electric Power Miraiz , improving net assets by approximately 2.2 billion yen.

Itochu Enex, holding a 17.5% voting stake post-allotment, will collaborate on energy platform expansion, EV charging services, and retail energy solutions.

The agreement grants Itochu Enex certain consent rights on strategic decisions and allows it to appoint a board observer.
