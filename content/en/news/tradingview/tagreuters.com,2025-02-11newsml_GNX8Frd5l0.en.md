OCALA, Fla., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — AIM ImmunoTech Inc. (NYSE American: AIM)(“AIM” or the “Company”) today announced that AIM CEO Thomas K. Equels and Prof. Casper H.J. van Eijck, MD, PhD, Pancreato-biliary Surgeon at the Erasmus Medical Center (“Erasmus MC”) and Coordinating Investigator for the DURIPANC study in late-stage pancreatic cancer, participated in a Virtual Investor “What This Means” segment. Access the segment here.

As part of the segment, Mr. Equels and Professor van Eijck discuss the recent approval from the Erasmus MC Safety Committee to proceed with the Phase 2 Study of Ampligen® and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi as a potential combination treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. DURIPANC is an investigator-initiated, exploratory, open-label, single-center study in the Netherlands at Erasmus MC. The approval to proceed to Phase 2 was granted following the Safety Committee’s review of the complete Phase 1 safety data, which found the combination treatment to be generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related severe adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities.

The Virtual Investor “What this Means” segment featuring AIM ImmunoTech is now available here.
