Welcome back to the Short Seller Series – A recap of the most heavily shorted stocks on the ASX and those experiencing significant changes to short interest over the past week.

Short selling data is four days behind today's date because reporting is not mandatory until three business days after the trade. The tables below will compare:

* Week-on-week changes between 21 January and 3 February 2025
* Month-on-month changes between 6 January 2024 and 3 February 2025

Most Shorted

| Ticker | Company | Short % | Week-on-Week | Month-on-Month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BOE | Boss Energy | 19.15% | -0.40% | 2.09% |
| PDN | Paladin Energy | 16.00% | 0.94% | 1.57% |
| SYR | Syrah Resources | 13.19% | -0.02% | 0.40% |
| PLS | Pilbara Minerals | 12.84% | 0.36% | -1.18% |
| DMP | Domino's Pizza | 12.81% | -0.49% | 0.62% |
| IEL | Idp Education | 12.68% | 0.12% | 0.48% |
| MIN | Mineral Resources | 12.51% | 0.09% | 0.05% |
| SGR | Star Entertainment | 11.10% | 1.19% | 4.70% |
| DYL | Deep Yellow | 10.76% | -0.25% | -0.09% |
| LTR | Liontown Resources | 10.49% | 0.29% | 0.87% |

Key takeaways

* Boss Energy and Paladin Energy remain the most shorted stocks on the market
* Short interest in The Star has surged to record levels. For context, it was 7.15% at the start of the year. The Australian reported that Blackstone is considering an acquisition, drawn to The Star’s gaming machines. However, the firm is expected to wait until the company enters voluntary administration before making a move

Rising Shorts

| Ticker | Company | Short % | Week-on-Week | Month-on-Month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZIP | ZIP Co | 4.72% | 1.90% | 1.83% |
| DRO | Droneshield | 9.07% | 1.87% | 4.85% |
| LOT | Lotus Resources | 5.01% | 1.45% | 1.65% |
| SGR | Star Entertainment | 11.10% | 1.19% | 4.70% |
| PDN | Paladin Energy | 16.00% | 0.94% | 1.57% |
| BMN | Bannerman Energy | 4.31% | 0.84% | 0.67% |
| BVS | Bravura Solutions | 0.90% | 0.73% | -0.02% |

| URW | Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield | 1.13% | 0.60% | 0.54% |
| CIA | Champion Iron | 6.78% | 0.60% | 0.70% |
| CHN | Chalice Mining | 6.65% | 0.59% | 0.00% |
| INR | Ioneer | 4.94% | 0.56% | 0.63% |
| HCW | Healthco Healthcare and Wellness REIT | 1.66% | 0.53% | 0.70% |
| BRN | Brainchip | 3.40% | 0.50% | 0.68% |

Key takeaways

* Zip shares have fallen around 33% since January 29, following weaker-than-expected December quarter results. While quarterly EBITDA jumped 50.2% to $35.3 million, this still missed analyst expectations of $40.2 million — a 12.1% shortfall. For a company that has rallied tenfold in the past 14 months and was expected to be charging toward profitability, this was a notable miss.
* Short interest in uranium stocks, particularly ex-major (Paladin, Boss Energy, and Deep Yellow) has ticked higher, notably smaller peers Lotus Resources and Bannerman Energy. Uranium prices have dipped below US$70/lb, nearing a 16-month low from January 27, as concerns over demand and a growing supply response weigh on sentiment.

Most covered

| Ticker | Company | Short % | Week-on-Week | Month-on-Month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| HPI | Hotel Property Investments | 0.08% | -0.72% | -0.14% |
| DMP | Domino's Pizza | 12.81% | -0.49% | 0.62% |
| NSR | National Storage REIT | 2.17% | -0.49% | -0.68% |
| MGR | Mirvac Group | 4.64% | -0.41% | 1.20% |
| BOE | Boss Energy | 19.15% | -0.40% | 2.09% |
| TCL | Transurban Group | 0.91% | -0.37% | -0.42% |
| MP1 | Megaport | 10.10% | -0.35% | 0.25% |
| KGN | Kogan.com | 0.97% | -0.32% | -0.14% |
| STO | Santos | 0.66% | -0.30% | -0.16% |

Key takeaways

* A relatively quiet week for short covering
* Latin Resources saw shorts unwind after its official acquisition by Pilbara Minerals on February 4, leading to its removal from the ASX
* Domino’s Pizza experienced a slight pullback in short interest just before its stock surged 21.3% on Friday, February 7. The rally followed the company’s announcement of 172 store closures in Japan and a group-wide review that has already identified $18.6 million in annualised savings. Short sellers have been betting against Domino’s for the past eight months, likely due to ongoing inflationary pressures, weakening consumer demand trends, and headwinds in markets like Japan and Europe. However, the latest cost-cutting measures and strategic store closures could challenge the short thesis
