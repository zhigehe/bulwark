China CPI beat market expectations in January, but is likely to post a deep decline in February, Citigroup analysts say in a note. They cite a high base from the same period a year earlier when the Lunar New Year fell in February versus in late January this year. "The next few months could see a very bumpy trajectory for CPI. The post-CNY February could see a quick softening of prices with seasonal demand declining," says the investment bank. While there could be a recovery in March, that will hinge on consumer demand, it adds. (singaporeeditors@dowjones.com)
