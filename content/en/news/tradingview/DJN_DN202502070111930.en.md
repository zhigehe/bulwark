Communications services companies ticked down amid mixed earnings.

Warner Music Group shares rebounded after analysts at brokerage Guggenheim maintained their price target on the record label's shares following lackluster earnings and a brace of deals.

South Korean internet giant Naver posted stronger-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter and record annual revenue, driven by robust growth at its core search-platform and e-commerce businesses.

Expedia shares surged to all-time highs after the online travel agency posted earnings ahead of investors' expectations.
