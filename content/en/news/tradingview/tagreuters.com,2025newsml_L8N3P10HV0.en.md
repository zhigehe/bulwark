\*\* Shares of Talgo jump around 6% to their highest since August after Poland's state-owned investment fund PFR said on Monday it intends to make an offer for all shares of the Spanish train maker

\*\* PFR, which owns Polish train maker Pesa, did not specify how much it would offer for Talgo

\*\* "This news about Pesa has a positive bias for the stock since it would be an offer for 100%, and because it seems that it would seek to resolve the main concerns of the government," says brokerage Sabadell

\*\* Earlier media reports said PFR was considering merging Talgo and Pesa

\*\* If gains hold, Talgo shares will see their best day in a year
