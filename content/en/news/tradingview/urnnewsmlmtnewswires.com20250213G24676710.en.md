Kalgoorlie Gold Mining is fast-tracking follow-up reverse circulation drilling at its Lighthorse gold discovery at the Pinjin project in Western Australia, with drilling expected to begin on or about Mar. 4, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The drilling will test beneath a mineralized gold blanket to assess the potential for a deeper gold system, the filing said.

The assessment is ongoing to determine the potential strike extent of the discovery, and it is anticipated that additional drill programs will be necessary, per the filing.

Shares rose 5% in recent trade, reaching their highest since late 2022.
