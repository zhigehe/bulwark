The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is on course to lower the cash rate by half a percentage point to 3.75% for the last time next week as previous rate cuts have done their job of stirring the economy, ANZ Research said in a Wednesday note.

The RBNZ is expected to adopt a more cautious stance given that the official cash rate (OCR) is "now much closer to neutral and the economy [is] showing clear signs of life," said ANZ Research. However, risks are tilted towards a lower OCR trough than ANZ Research's 3.5% forecast as the RBNZ's central estimate of neutral is 3%.

The RBNZ is set to deliver its policy decision on Feb. 19. It last cut the rate by 50 basis points to 4.25% in November 2024.
