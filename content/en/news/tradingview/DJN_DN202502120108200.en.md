By Adriano Marchese

Toronto stocks were lower in Wednesday midday trading. Sector performance in the session was mixed, with losses primarily in manufacturing and consumer durable stocks, offset by gains from the materials and communications sectors.

Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index slipped 0.2% to 25573.7 and the blue-chip S&P/TSX 60 declined by 0.3% to 1538.22.

In step with the commodities rise, Barrick Gold shares jumped after the company reported higher earnings in the fourth quarter thanks to the soaring price of gold. The Toronto mining giant flagged a drop in production of the precious metal in 2025 due to suspension of its Mali operations amid a dispute with the government.

Other market movers:

Restaurant Brands International shares rose 1% to 96.48 Canadian dollars after the company reported better-than-expected revenue and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, despite a slowdown in sales growth compared with a year earlier.

Aritzia shares fell 3.1% to C$69.79 after the women's fashion brand said its founder and chairman intends to sell C$66.4 million worth of shares by way of a secondary offering.
