The Bank of Thailand is likely to tread cautiously with rate cuts as uncertainty around Trump's policies stays high, Nomura analysts say. They think BOT will pause in February before resuming cutting in April and August once there is more clarity on the impact of trade frictions. That said, the central bank has flagged downside risks to its growth forecasts, citing limited impact from fiscal handouts, which Nomura's Charnon Boonnuch and Euben Paracuelles think raises the risk of an earlier cut. They maintain below-consensus GDP growth forecasts of 2.5% in 2024 and 2.6% in 2025, flagging weaker global growth and trade protectionism as key downside risks. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
