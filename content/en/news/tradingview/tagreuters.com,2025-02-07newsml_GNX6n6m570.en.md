SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , a clinical stage oncology company focused on developing treatments that address mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, today announced that on February 3, 2025 (the “Grant Date”), ORIC granted a total of 29,600 non-qualified stock options and 4,800 restricted stock units to two new non-executive employees who began their employment with ORIC in January 2025.

These inducement grants were granted pursuant to the ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, subject to recipient’s continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date.

One-third (1/3rd) of the restricted stock units will vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date. The inducement grants are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable stock option and restricted stock unit agreements and the ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan.

The inducement grants were approved by ORIC’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, as required by Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4), and were granted as a material inducement to employment in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4).
