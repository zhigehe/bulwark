The FTSE 100 traded at a record high Tuesday, following a 0.8% gain on Monday.

BP shares lacked direction, following a 7.4% yesterday, its best day in two years, after the report of activist Elliott building a stake.

The energy company reported lower-than-expected profits, as the company announced a strategy “reset” later this month and a review of its 2025 share buyback plans.

Meanwhile, Entain dropped over 10%, the most since October, after CEO Gavin Isaacs stepped down immediately, raising concerns over leadership stability.

The FTSE 250 slipped 0.2%, with homebuilder Bellway down nearly 7% due to flat pricing forecasts.

On the FTSE All-Share, PZ Cussons surged 15%, its biggest jump since 1999, after raising guidance following a cost adjustment in its Nigerian unit.
