LAHTI/HELSINKI, 10 February 2025 – Hedin Automotive Retail Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, a subsidiary of Wetteri Oyj, have signed an agreement under which Wetteri will acquire the Kia and Mitsubishi operation in Lahti. The agreement includes the sales and aftermarket services of Kia and Mitsubishi, operating in Tupalankatu.

"We have systematically expanded our Kia and Mitsubishi businesses to several locations. The acquisition strengthens Wetteri's position and opens up opportunities for us to negotiate other new brand representations in the Lahti area", tells CEO of Wetteri Oyj Aarne Simula.

“The sale of the Kia and Mitsubishi operation in Lahti continues Hedin Automotive's long-term network optimization plan. We are proud of our achievements as a Kia and Mitsubishi dealer in Lahti and would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff and customers for their trust. We believe that Wetteri will provide a strong platform for further development and will continue to offer excellent service to Kia and Mitsubishi customers in the region“, says CEO of Hedin Automotive Oy Helena Sauramo.

“Our partnership with Kia and Mitsubishi remains strong. In October 2024, we further expanded our presence by opening new Kia and Mitsubishi salespoints in Espoo. In this dealership, we also offer a wide range of vehicles from Nissan and Ford. This new location strengthens our commitment to providing customers with high-quality service and an enhanced selection of automotive brands”, Helena Sauramo adds.

After the sale, Hedin Automotive will continue Kia business operations in 10 locations: Espoo, Forssa, Helsinki, Hämeenlinna, Jyväskylä, Järvenpää, Kotka, Porvoo, Tampere and in Turku. Mitsubishi business operations will continue in 11 locations: Espoo, Forssa, Helsinki, Hämeenlinna, Jyväskylä, Järvenpää, Kotka, Oulu, Porvoo, Tampere and in Turku. In addition to car sales all locations offer authorized after-sales services, including maintenance and spare parts.

As a result of the transaction, the employees of Hedin Automotive Retail Oy in the Lahti Tupalankatu dealership will transfer to Wetteri.

The transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2025.
