VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Western Star Resources Inc. (WSR: CSE) is pleased to announce that it has closed the previously announced Shares for Debt Settlement transactions (see press release dated February 3, 2025) to settle an aggregate of CDN$209,400 (the “Debt”) owed to certain officers and directors of the Corporation (the “**Creditors**”) by issuing an aggregate of 1,745,000 common shares (the “**Shares**”) of the Corporation at a deemed price of $0.12 per share. The Shares are subject to a hold period of four months and one day.

Accordingly, the portion of the debt settlement with the insiders constitutes a related-party transaction within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions). The issuance of the shares to the insiders is exempt from the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b) as the company's shares are not listed on a specified market and from the minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) as the value of the shares being issued under the debt settlement does not exceed 25 per cent of the company's market capitalization.

**Additional Information**

Additional information about the Company and the Transaction is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company's profile. The summary of the Transaction set out above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the description of the Transaction in the Company's filing statement posted on SEDAR.
