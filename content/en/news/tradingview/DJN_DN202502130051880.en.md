Elon Musk said he would withdraw his $97.4 billion bid for the nonprofit that controls OpenAI if the board stopped its conversion to a for-profit company.

"If [the] OpenAI board is prepared to preserve the charity's mission and stipulate to take the "for sale" sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid," lawyers for Musk said in a court filing Wednesday.

Updates to follow as news develops.
