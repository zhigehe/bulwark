\*\* Shares of Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd fall as much as 15.1% to A$1.485, their lowest level since November 6 last year

\*\* AMP top loser in the ASX200 benchmark index

\*\* Declares final dividend of 1 Australian cent per share, below Visible Alpha consensus of 2.6 Australian cents apiece

\*\* FY24 underlying NPAT of A$236 mln ($149.03 mln) falls shy of Citi estimate of A$242 mln, but beats VA consensus marginally

\*\* AMP says to target a dividend payout of 2 Aussie cents apiece each half through 2025

\*\* Both the 2H24 (final) dividend and likely too the FY25 target dividend disappoint, says Citi

\*\* Analysts at Jefferies say "would have liked more" (final dividend)

\*\* More than 21.4 mln shares change hands, vs the 30-day average of 5.8 mln shares

\*\* AMP stock down 5.5% this year, as of 0212 GMT

($1 = 1.5835 Australian dollars)
