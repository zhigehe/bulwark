**ROSE Info**

Oasis Network is a first-layer, scalable blockchain network with a focus on privacy and proof of stake. Through confidential computing, users can control and protect their data even when it's being utilized in various applications and services.

The Oasis Network has the capacity to process a large number of transactions simultaneously due to its structure of subordinate parallel blockchains, also known as "shards." Instead of processing all transactions on a single main blockchain (which is a common practice for many blockchain networks and causes speed and scalability issues), Oasis Network distributes transactions across different subordinate blockchains that can process transactions in parallel.

The ROSE token serves as the governance token in the Oasis Network. The token is used for participating in voting on decisions related to network development and can also be staked to get rewards.
