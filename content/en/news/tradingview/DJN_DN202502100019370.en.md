Bitcoin rises after initially falling in reaction to President Trump's announcement about imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports from Monday. Trump also said he would announce reciprocal tariffs on countries that impose levies on U.S. exports later in the week. Bitcoin's reaction to the news indicates markets are more resilient to Trump's tariff threats, "or at least have got used to trading through them," XTB's Kathleen Brooks says in a note. Bitcoin rises 1.7% to $97,627, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
