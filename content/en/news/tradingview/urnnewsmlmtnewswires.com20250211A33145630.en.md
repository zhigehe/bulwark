BridgeBio Pharma said Tuesday that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for acoramidis, under the brand name Beyonttra, to treat wild-type or variant transthyretin amyloidosis in adults with cardiomyopathy.

BridgeBio said German pharmaceutical company Bayer will launch acoramidis in H1 of 2025 in the European Union.

BridgeBio also said that based on its licensing agreement with Bayer, it expects to receive a $75 million milestone payment as well as royalties in a tiered structure on sales of acoramidis in the EU.

Acoramidis has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration under the brand Attruby.
