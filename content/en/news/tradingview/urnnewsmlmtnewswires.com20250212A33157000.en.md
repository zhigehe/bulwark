Restaurant Brands International reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, driven by comparable sales gains at Tim Hortons and Burger King.

Revenue climbed to $2.3 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31 from $1.82 billion the year earlier, coming in just above the $2.28 billion average analyst estimate on FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $0.81 from $0.75 year over year and beat the $0.78 consensus.

Comparable sales increased 2.5%, a deceleration from 5.8% in the same period of 2023 but stronger than the 1.6% increase modeled by eight analysts in the FactSet survey. Comparable sales rose 2.2% at Tim Hortons and 1.1% at Burger King, while dipping 0.2% at Popeyes.

Management in February 2024 provided a long-term guidance that forecast, on average, 3% comparable sales growth and 8% system-wide sales growth from 2024 to 2028. In 2024, the two measures were up 2.3% and 5.4%, respectively.

The company is "on track" to hit its five-year outlook of 8%-plus organic net operating income growth, Chief Financial Officer Sami Siddiqui told analysts on a conference call Wednesday. NOI is being "supported by continued cost discipline and a development focus on higher systemwide sales and (return on investment) contribution markets," he said, according to a FactSet transcript.

In 2024, Restaurant Brands reported 9% organic adjusted operating income growth.
