ECR Minerals is working on finalizing the terms of the planned sale of its subsidiary, Mercator Gold Australia, to Octo Holdings for AU$4.5 million in cash.

The mineral exploration and development company said Thursday that the non-exclusive and non-binding heads of terms are still subject to due diligence procedures and the execution of a legally binding deal, with Octo aiming to close the transaction on Feb. 28.

Additionally, ECR said it signed two new confidentiality agreements, for a total of six, after receiving interest in Mercator from additional parties amid rising antimony prices in certain markets.
