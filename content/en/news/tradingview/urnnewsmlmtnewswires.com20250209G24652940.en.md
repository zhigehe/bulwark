Savor signed a lease agreement with Cooper & Company for a new entertainment site in the Britomart precinct in Auckland, set to open in mid-2025, according to a Feb. 7 filing with the New Zealand bourse.

In line with this, the company has been allowed to pre-terminate its current lease of the Seafarers Building, resulting in the closure of the MoVida and Bar Non Solo businesses, per the filing. Affected employees have been redeployed.

In the same filing, the hospitality group reported "strong summer levels" of trading through November and December 2024.

Fiscal year-to-date group revenue was 5% lower than a year ago as of December, an improvement from a decline of 8% as of August. The company said while it expects the "trend of recovery" to continue through the last fiscal quarter, it is unable to provide an earnings guidance due to uncertainties.
