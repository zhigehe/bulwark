(Updates with additional details in the fourth and fifth paragraphs.)

Spirit AeroSystems reported preliminary Q4 net revenue Monday of $1.66 billion, down from $1.81 billion a year earlier.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect $1.55 billion.

In a filing, the airline operator attributed the lower revenue to the impact of its funding deal with airplane maker Boeing , which was recognized in Q4 of 2023 and boosted its revenue for that quarter.

Additionally, the company said in the filing that it expects to make a going-concern disclosure in its 2024 Form 10-K, reiterating a warning made in November that "there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern" due to its cash flow and liquidity position.

The company said it is seeking to amend its existing Term Loan B credit agreement to do away with the required delivery of audited financials with an unqualified opinion on its status as a going concern for the year ended Dec. 31.
