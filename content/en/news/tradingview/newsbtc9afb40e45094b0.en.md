**Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break**

Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,800 support zone, like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $2,750 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone.

The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Finally, it found support near the $2,500 zone. The price is now consolidating and seems to be forming a base above the $2,500 level.

Ethereum price is now trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,735 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance.

An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term.

**Another Drop In ETH?**

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,520 zone.

A clear move below the $2,520 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,365 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.
