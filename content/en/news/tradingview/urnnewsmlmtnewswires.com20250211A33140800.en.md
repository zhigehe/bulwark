Asian stock markets churned on Tuesday, as traders weighed US President Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, and possibly automobiles.

Hong Kong and Shanghai finished in the red, while other regional exchanges were uneven. Tokyo was closed on holiday.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index opened evenly but lost ground through the day, finishing off 1.1% after President Trump on Monday announced 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel, and possible levies on imported automobiles.

The broad gauge Hang Seng fell 227.12 to 21,294.86, as losing issues outnumbered gainers 67 to 15. The Hang Seng TECH Index lost 2.7% on the day, while the Mainland Properties Index fell 2.1%.

Leading the upside was smartphone-components maker Sunny Optical Technology, gaining 3%, while Geely Automobile declined 10.3%.

On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite fell 0.1% to 3,318.06.

On the other regional exchanges, the S. Korean KOSPI rose 0.7%; the Taiwan TWSE declined 0.6%; the Australian ASX 200 was flat; the Singapore Straits Times Index fell 0.4%, and the Thai Set inclined 1.1%.

In late trading in Mumbai, the Sensex was down 1.3%, down for the fifth-straight trading session on a soft earnings season and the international trade outlook, reported Mumbai-based The Economic Times.
