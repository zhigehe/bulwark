Renova reported January electricity sales of 245.76 million kWh, exceeding its target by 2.4% and marking a 29.5% year-on-year increase, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The rise was driven by the addition of the Omaezakikou Biomass plant, which boosted total biomass capacity to 395.3 MW.

Year-to-date electricity sales reached 2.04 billion kWh, lower by 0.7% from the plan but 3.8% higher than the previous year. The impact of output curtailments remained minor, accounting for just 0.077% of the annual revenue plan.
