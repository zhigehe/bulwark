Stellar Resources said drilling results from the Queen Hill and Severn deposits at its Heemskirk tin project in Tasmania intersected high-grade mineralization, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

The program consisted of a 24-hole diamond drilling campaign for around 9,500 meters in total, focusing on infill and extensions to the project's 2023 mineral resource estimate, the filing said.

It has completed 12 holes for a total of 5,923 meters, as part of the pre-feasibility study.

The results include intercepts of 23.3 meters at 2.2% tin from 295.7 meters and seven meters at 1.79% tin from 203.8 meters.
