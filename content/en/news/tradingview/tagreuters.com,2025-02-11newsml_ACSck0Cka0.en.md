Not for dissemination in or into the United States or through U.S. newswires

***All dollars are Canadian unless otherwise noted***

VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 / **Relevant Gold Corp. (OTCQB:RGCCF)** (the "**Company**" or "**Relevant Gold**") is pleased to announce a non-brokered private placement to raise gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000 through the sale of up to 16,666,667 shares at the price of $0.30 per share led by two strategic investors.

**Kinross Gold Corporation** ("Kinross") has committed to increase its equity position in the Company to 19.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares with this financing. Kinross currently holds approximately 9.9% of the Company's common shares on a partially diluted basis.

**Mr. William G. Bollinger** has also committed to increase his equity position in the company to 19.9% in connection with this financing. Mr. Bollinger currently holds approximately 16.7% of the Company's common shares.

The proceeds from the sale of the private placement will be used to fund exploration activities at the Company's projects in Wyoming, USA, and for general working capital.

"This financing marks a significant milestone for Relevant Gold as it will allow us to launch a major drill program in 2025 to capitalize on last year's very promising exploratory results," said Relevant Gold CEO Rob Bergmann. "The stepped-up investment by our strategic shareholders underscores their confidence in our incredible team, our assets, and the vast exploration potential of Wyoming."

Certain directors and officers of the Company may acquire securities under the private placement. Any such participation would be considered to be a "related party transaction" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("**MI 61-101**"). The transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of any shares issued to or the consideration paid by such persons will exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization.

The Company may pay a finder's fee in connection with the private placement and this financing is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. All securities to be issued in the Private Placement will be subject to a four (4) month hold period from the closing date under applicable securities laws in Canada and amongst other things, receipt by Relevant Gold of all necessary regulatory approvals, including Exchange approval. The Company anticipates closing of the private placement in late February 2025, subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (The "U.S. Securities Act") or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. Persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.
