Oil edges down in early Asian trade as traders digest U.S. CPI data and signs of supply pressure. Higher-than-expected inflation reinforces views that the Fed could keep rates high, pressuring dollar-denominated commodities, Pepperstone strategist Quasar Elizundia says in a note. Remarks from Trump regarding potential negotiations to end the Ukraine war also fuel speculation about easing restrictions on Russian oil producers, he adds. "If this materializes, it would reduce supply risks from Russia and contribute to bearish pressure on crude prices." A raised 2025 U.S. crude production estimate from the EIA adds another supply-side factor, he says. Front-month WTI futures fall 0.4% to $71.07/bbl; front-month Brent down 0.5% at $74.83/bbl.
