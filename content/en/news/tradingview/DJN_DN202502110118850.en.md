OTTAWA--Canada on Tuesday named a former senior law-enforcement officer and national security adviser as the country's new fentanyl czar, delivering on a promise made to President Trump to help avert a 25% tariff on the country's U.S.-bound exports.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the appointment of Kevin Brosseau would take effect immediately. Last October, Brosseau was appointed as the deputy national security adviser to Trudeau, following a career in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and in the senior ranks of the federal bureaucracy.

Trudeau said in a statement Brosseau would work with U.S. counterparts and law-enforcement agencies to accelerate Canadian efforts to disrupt and dismantle the fentanyl trade.

Trudeau promised Trump that he would appoint a fentanyl czar and beef up efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. In exchange, Trump provided a temporary reprieve on a 25% tariff he threatened to impose on imports from Canada and Mexico due to what he said were lax border-security measures from America's two neighbors.
