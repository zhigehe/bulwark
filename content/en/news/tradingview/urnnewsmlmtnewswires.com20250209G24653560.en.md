Utilities stocks rose a little past 0.7% at midday Monday. Hopes of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates received a setback after the US jobless rate fell from 4.1% to 4%.

The Environment Court approved Meridian Energy's 120-megawatt Ruakaka solar farm in Northland, New Zealand following an appeal. The solar farm can produce up to 200 gigawatts per hour of electricity per year.

On the other hand, the information technology sector fell almost 2%, reflecting weakness in the US tech stocks.

WiseTech Global said it received two confidential complaints, one from an employee and one from a supplier, concerning Founder and Founding Chief Executive Richard White. The complaints are being reviewed as part of an ongoing board evaluation.
