European natural gas futures dropped over 6.5% to below €52.5 per megawatt-hour, moving further away from a two-year high of €59, as optimism grew over potential Ukraine peace talks.

US President Donald Trump reportedly initiated negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, with both leaders expressing openness to peace.

This eased concerns over supply risks, pressuring prices lower.

Additionally, forecasts for milder temperatures in mid-to-late February reduced demand expectations.

Further weighing on prices, reports suggest the European Commission may introduce a gas price cap as part of an upcoming industry support package set to be proposed on February 26.

However, concerns over storage remain, as Europe’s gas storage is 47.2% full—the lowest for this time of year since 2022—raising worries about refilling for next winter.
