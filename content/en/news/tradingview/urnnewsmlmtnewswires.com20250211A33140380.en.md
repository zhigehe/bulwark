Hess Midstream said late Monday it priced an upsized underwritten secondary offering of 11 million class A shares at $39.45 per share for gross proceeds of about $434 million.

The selling shareholder, an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners, who is a part of BlackRock, granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,650,000 additional Class A shares. The gross proceeds are exclusive of any proceeds from the exercise of the option.

The offering, which was increased from the initial 10 million class A shares, is expected to close this Wednesday.
