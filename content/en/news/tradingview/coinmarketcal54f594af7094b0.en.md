Listing FLORK CTO (FLORK) on XT.COM could be significant for its price. Listings can increase a coin's visibility and accessibility to investors. XT.COM, an established platform, enhances this effect by offering a new trading pair, FLORK/USDT, making it easier to trade. Being listed in the Innovation Zone also suggests a focus on novelty, potentially attracting meme coin enthusiasts.
