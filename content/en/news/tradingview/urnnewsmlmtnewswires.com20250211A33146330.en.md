(Update with Goldman Sachs' response in the second paragraph and the latest stock movement in the last paragraph.)

Goldman Sachs Group is ending a pledge to refuse initial public offering business with companies that have all white, male boards, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing a statement from a company spokesperson.

"As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy," a Goldman spokesperson said in an emailed statement to MT Newswires. "We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach."

Goldman shares were edging 0.5% lower in recent trading.
