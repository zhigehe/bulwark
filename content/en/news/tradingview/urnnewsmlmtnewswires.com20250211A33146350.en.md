Goldman Sachs is open to acquisitions in asset and wealth management, but would be selective in its approach to any potential deals, Chief Executive David Solomon said Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Solomon told a UBS financial services conference in Miami that the bank would consider "things that could accelerate our asset and wealth management journey," but also said "the bar to do significant things is very, very high," according to the report.

He said the current regulatory environment was "still uncertain" and the policy direction a bit more complicated. He said he expected the Trump administration to pursue a more growth-oriented agenda, however, according to the report.

Goldman Sachs did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.
