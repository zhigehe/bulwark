Sudan is seeking investments from Russia and China to help rebuild its oil infrastructure, which has suffered more than $22 billion of damage due to civil war in the country, its energy minister Mohieldien Naiem Mohamed Saied said on Wednesday.

He said there were damages to refineries, pipelines, oil terminals and oil fields.

"Before we came to India, we visited China. We are discussing with our partners how to build our infrastructure. We also discussed with Russia," Saied told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week conference.

He said he met Russian energy minister Sergei Tsivilev in Moscow in November. "The talks were positive," he added.

The ongoing civil war erupted in April 2023 over disputes about the integration of the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, after they worked together to oust civilians with whom they had shared power following the uprising that toppled autocrat Omar al-Bashir.

Sudan’s largest refinery in Khartoum, partly owned by China, was set ablaze in January.

Saied said Sudan is seeking investment to rebuild the Khartoum plant and a new 120,000 barrels per day refinery near the Red Sea.

"The new refinery will be in the eastern part (of the country) which is not hit by war,” he said.

Sudan is also willing to offer Indian companies stakes in its oil blocks, he said.

Asked if the companies would be interested in investing in Sudan, he said, “War is about to finish. Sudan is rich with resources and many companies are interested in investing in Sudan.”
