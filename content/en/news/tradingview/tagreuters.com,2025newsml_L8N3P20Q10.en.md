Investors placed over 110 billion pounds ($136 billion) in initial orders at the launch via syndication of a new 4.5% 2035 British government bond, bookrunners on the deal said on Tuesday, near the record 115 billion pounds' demand at a 15-year gilt sale last month.

Price guidance for the gilt to yield 5.5-6.0 basis points more than the 4.25% 2034 benchmark gilt (GB10YT=RR) remained unchanged.

The sale is Britain's last government bond syndication of the 2024/25 financial year and strategists at RBC forecast in a note to clients before the launch that it would have a transaction size of around 11 billion pounds.

Orders at British government bond syndications are often as much as 10 times the amount sold.

Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and NatWest are acting as joint leads on the transaction.

($1 = 0.8088 pounds)
