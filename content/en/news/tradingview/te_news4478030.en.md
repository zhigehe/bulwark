Steel rebar futures fell to CNY 3,200 per tonne in February, the lowest in one month, and tracking the sharp decline in Chinese developers' equities as markets assessed how incoming fiscal support from the Chinese government will impact the solvency for constructors.

Reports indicated that Chinese authorities would set up a CNY 20 billion fund to purchase unsold homes and land from Vanke, the most ambitious push to aid the property giant to start the set of measures that were pledged to aid the region’s constructors, among the world’s top rebar consumers.

However, assets tied to property developers quickly lost steam to indicate investors’ cynicism on whether this would translate to more activity in the future, limiting buying competition for rebar.

In the meantime, steel tariffs from the US did little to impact the outlook on the metal’s trade from China as previous levies from President Trump’s first term disconnected supply lines of Chinese steel to North America.
