Norconsult ASA

Sandvika, 12 February 2025 (OSE: NORCO): Norconsult Norge AS, a subsidiary of Norconsult ASA, has been awarded the assignment to design the new road E6 Roterud - Storhove.

Since 2020, Norconsult, in collaboration with AF Gruppen Norge AS, has been working on the development of the zoning plan for the new road, which was approved by Gjøvik and Lillehammer municipalities in 2022.

The E6 Roterud - Storhove project is a major infrastructure initiative commissioned by Nye Veier, aimed at developing a new four-lane highway along the lake Mjøsa, stretching between Roterud and Storhove, covering approximately 23 kilometres. The project includes several significant technical features, including three grade-separated interchanges, a 4,250-meter twin-tube tunnel, and a new bridge over Gudbrandsdalslågen spanning more than 500 meters. Additionally, the project encompasses more than thirty other structures, such as retaining walls, culverts, and bridges.

"This is a major project for Norconsult where we get to use all of our interdisciplinary professional expertise, and together with AF Gruppen and Nye Veier we get to realise a new and modern road project for increased safety and better accessibility," says Bård Hernes, EVP Norway Head office at Norconsult.

The objective of the project is to enhance the transport infrastructure in the region while upholding stringent environmental standards.

Sustainability and environmental considerations are important in this assignment. For instance, there is a target to reutilise the existing road infrastructure south of Vingrom to curtail resource consumption and minimize environmental impact. Furthermore, environmental protection is critical when traversing the Lågendeltaet Nature Reserve and the groundwater resources of Lillehammer Municipality at Hovemoen, with the goal of minimizing physical interventions and adverse effects on the natural environment.

The construction period is set to begin in the first half of 2025, with project completion scheduled for 2030.

The assignment is subject to completion of an intention announcement in accordance with public procurement regulations.
