The South Korean won held its recent decline below 1,455 per dollar, as global sentiment weakened amid looming threat of new US tariffs.

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump unveiled a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, expanding existing duties and escalating his trade overhaul, set to take effect later today.

In South Korea, Acting President Choi Sang-mok convened a meeting to discuss responses to Trumpâ€™s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs.

On the monetary policy front, BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong cautioned on Thursday that the widely anticipated rate cut scheduled for later this month is not a "done deal".

Traders now look ahead to a slew of data releases this week, including exports and import prices, and unemployment figures.
