South Korea's steel industry is preparing for potential fallout after US President Donald Trump signed proclamations imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, effective March 12, Yonhap News reported Tuesday.

Acting President Choi Sang-mok said the government will respond with pre-prepared measures and seek further negotiations with Washington. While concerns remain over profitability, Choi noted the tariffs could create opportunities as they apply equally to all competitors, the news agency said.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is also in close talks with local businesses to cushion the impact and held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to assess the situation, according to a separate Yonhap News report.
