SKOPJE (N. Macedonia), February 13 (SeeNews) - A1 Telekom Austria Group said the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of its subsidiary in North Macedonia rose by 18.3% year-on-year in 2024, reaching 57 million euro ($59.4 million).

A1 Makedonija's revenues increased by 8.2% on the year in 2024, to 164 million euro, driven largely by retail mobile service revenues, A1 Telekom Austria Group said in an annual financial statement earlier this week.

"Results in the mobile business profited from the growth in the postpaid subscriber base and the monetization of 5G tariffs with unlimited data in the high-value segment. Retail fixed-line service revenues also rose on the back of a higher RGU base," the company said.

A1 Makedonija competes with T-Mobile Macedonia, part of Deutsche Telekom, on a market of 1.8 million people.

In Southeast Europe, A1 Telekom Austria Group also operates in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia.
