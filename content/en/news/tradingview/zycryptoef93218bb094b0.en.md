Digital asset exchange Binance has recorded surging inflows following a drop in Bitcoin price. This liquidation has wiped out billions in value from the crypto market, increasing sell pressure. Inflows to centralized crypto exchanges point to an imminent sale due to the ease of transactions, while outflows to other custodians are viewed as longer-term hodling strategies.

****Binance Sell Pressure Spikes****

As inflows to the largest exchange by trading volumes surge, traders record weakened sentiments. This slowed down the chances of a price peak despite days of momentum in Bitcoin and altcoins. Binance market share makes it closely watched among traders. Volumes on the exchange help shape market sentiments, especially among retail investors.

A new CryptoQuant report shows the hourly Binance net taker volume plummeted, further sharpening sell pressures. This continues to spark a series of huge outflows from the market as investors offload assets to recover losses. Most retail assets sold are fairly new, likely purchased when the asset price soared above $100K.

“*The hourly Net Taker Volume on Binance turned sharply negative today, signaling a significant increase in selling pressure. It reached a peak of -$325M, the highest value in 2025, during the release of the ISM PMI and JOLTs Job Openings data, which revealed unfavorable results for risky assets. Monitoring this indicator, along with others, will be essential to determine whether fear is starting to dominate the market…”*

The effect of these macro factors on digital assets cannot be overstretched especially indices on institutional clients. These big players tend to move with the financial market, lowering inflows to risky assets like Bitcoin. Institutional volumes fueled a portion of crypto gains, resulting in price dips and slow investments. Last year, these participants ignited Bitcoin to new all-time highs.

****Funding Rates Plunges Momentum****

After the BTC price plunged from $108K, funding rates have consistently declined, showing a weak market position. This led to substantial capital outflows in the derivatives market and spells danger for other assets. The impact on altcoins is sharp corrections from double-digit gains to increased losses in the last 25 hours.

According to the analyst, a continuous trend could result in Bitcoin failing to maintain the $90K support. “*Deeper Corrections: Potentially testing lower Fibonacci levels or psychological thresholds. Conversely, if Funding Rates recover alongside strong buying activity, Bitcoin could stabilize and resume its upward trajectory,”* CryptoQuant added.
