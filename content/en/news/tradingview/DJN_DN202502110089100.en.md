By Asa Fitch

Vice President JD Vance's pledge at a Paris summit to ensure powerful artificial-intelligence chips are designed and made in the U.S. lifted shares of Intel, the beleaguered American chip giant that is expanding its domestic manufacturing.

Vance said that the AI race would be won by building plants that can produce the chips of the future. The comments came in a speech at the summit where he urged light regulation of AI and warned against overbearing restrictions that he said could hinder innovation.

Intel is building new chip-making facilities in Arizona, Ohio and other locations around the U.S., part of a massive expansion funded in part by the Chips Act, a federal program enacted under President Joe Biden. There had been doubt about the future of the funding in the new administration because President Trump called it "so bad" on the campaign trail, and suggested tariffs were the way to spur domestic production.

Intel's shares were up by around 7% in afternoon trading.
