Shares of industrial and transportation companies fell amid concerns about a revival of inflation.

Manufacturers were already concerned about tariff-related price increases before the unexpectedly hot inflation data.

TE Connectivity agreed to buy Richards Manufacturing, a provider of utility grid products, in an all-cash deal valued at about $2.3 billion.

Utility-equipment provider Siemens Energy said first-quarter net profit for fiscal year 2025 fell but revenue rose, as the company's order backlog continues to increase.
