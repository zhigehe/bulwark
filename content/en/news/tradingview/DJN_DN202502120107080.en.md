Traders are again focusing on the weather in South America following yesterday's WASDE report showing the outlook for world corn stocks falling by roughly 3 million metric tons. "The rains and delays in South America have a track record of pressuring yields which is keeping the bulls on the long side of the market fed," said Sterling Smith of StoneX in a note. Most-active corn futures are up 0.9% and wheat is climbing 0.4%, while soybeans sink 1.6%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
