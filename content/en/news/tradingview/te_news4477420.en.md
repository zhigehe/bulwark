Construction output in the UK increased by 1.5% year-on-year in December 2024, exceeding market forecasts of 1.1% and accelerating from an upwardly revised 1.0% growth in the previous month.

This marked the fifth consecutive month of expansion and the strongest pace since January 204, with new work expanding for the first time in 17 months (1.9% vs -0.3% in November).

However, repair and maintenance activity grew the least since November 2020 (1.0% vs 2.7%).

Monthly, construction output declined by 0.2%, reversing from an upwardly revised 0.6% gain in November, mainly dragged by falls in repair and maintenance (-1.8% vs 0.2%) as new work continued to grow (1.1% vs 1.0%).

Sector-wise, five out of nine sectors shrank, with non-housing repair and maintenance (-1.8%), and private housing repair and maintenance (-1.4%) contributing the most to the decrease.
