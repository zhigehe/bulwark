VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA –TheNewswire - February 10, 2025 – FITZROY MINERALSINC. (TSXV: FTZ, OTCQB: FTZFF) (“Fitzroy Minerals” or the"Company") is pleased to announce thata drill hole completed to adownhole depth of 350 m at the Caballos Copper Project, Chile(“Caballos”) hasintersected wide intervals of sulphide mineralization. The drill holecrossed the Pocuro Fault Zone (“PFZ”), targeting the down-dip continuation of acopper-molybdenum anomaly mapped at surface. The hole intersected251.0 m of tectonic and hydrothermal breccias with minor felsicintrusions, consistent with the previously mapped geology.Disseminated sulphides (chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and pyrite) arepresent over an interval of 185.7 m (from 62.5 m). The core iscurrently being logged in detail and prepared for assay, with resultsexpected in March 2025.

The drill rig has moved to the PolimetGold-Copper-Silver Project, Chile(“Polimet”). As previously announced on January 27, 2025,the Polimet Phase 1 drilling program is designed to test a series oftargets based on a combination of structural setting, gold and copperassay results, hydrothermal alteration, and IP geophysical conductors.The first of a seven-hole, 2,500 metre, diamond drilling program hasbegun.

Highlights:

* Caballos drill hole intersected 185.7 m(from 62.5 m) of sulphide-mineralized breccias containingchalcopyrite, molybdenite and pyrite1.
* Stronger mineralization, includingtourmaline and chalcopyrite clusters, and molybdenite veinlets, isobserved over 73.0 m (from 154.0 m).
* Diamond drilling started at PolimetandPhase 1 will compriseat least 2,500 m in seven holes, targeting mineralized structures andgeophysical conductors.

Merlin Marr-Johnson, CEO and President comments,"Drilling 186 m ofsulphides, including a 73 m interval with stronger mineralization, isa great start at Caballos. The hole crossed underneath a150-metre-wide brecciated fault zone with copper and molybdenummineralization at surface, and we pretty much intersected the samefeatures at depth in drill core. The abundance of molybdenite veinletswas a pleasant surprise and it helps that in Chile molybdenum is awell-understood by-product metal that trades at approximately fivetimes the copper price. It also helps that the southern zone atCaballos is a simple planar target with a surface expression that isover 1 km long. Once the assay results are returned we can plan thenext steps for the Project.

We are also pleased to report thatthe first hole at Polimet is now underway. Polimet is an epithermalgold-copper-silver system, with grades as high as 43 g/t gold and 7.8%copper reported in samples taken from historical pay-shoots on theProperty2. Our seven-hole drilling program aims toleverage our expertise in the area and give us the best chance ofintersecting more pay-shoots. We look forward to keeping the marketupdated with assay results and our progress.”

Caballos Copper Project, Chile

The drill hole at Caballos was oriented with an azimuthof 260 degrees and a dip of 70 degrees. The hole was collared in thePFZ and completed to a length of 350.0 m, ending in unmineralizedandesitic volcanic rocks. From surface to a depth of 65.2 m, the drillhole intersected tectonic breccia and then from 65.2 m to 251.0 m itintersected hydrothermal brecciaswith minor felsic intrusions, beforeentering the barren andesitic volcanics, with minor hydrothermalbreccia intercalations.

Initial logging indicates varying amounts ofchalcopyrite, molybdenite and pyrite throughout the hydrothermalbreccia, interrupted by two zones of 10 m and 16 m, that were morepyritic. The hydrothermal breccia is highly altered, with clasts oftenrich in a mixture of silica, tourmaline, albite, K-feldspar, cut bycarbonates and sulphate (possibly anhydrite) veinlets. Thechalcopyrite content typically increases with the presence oftourmaline clusters and decreases with the presence of carbonates.Molybdenite occurs as disseminations associated with chalcopyrite andoccasionally as discrete veinlets.

Field measurements and the downhole intersection ofgeological contacts show that the breccias have a dip of approximately70 degrees to the east. The hydrothermal breccia is also interruptedby two xenolith blocks of barren andesitic material that are eachapproximately 5 m across, indicative of a dynamic structural system.The lower (western) contact of the hydrothermal breccia with andesiticvolcanic rocks is characterized by chlorite-epidote alteration andappears to be a sub-vertical, reactivation fault.

Within the tectonic breccia transition and through themajority of the hydrothermal breccia, an intersection of 185.7 m (from62.5 m to 248.2 m) contained sulphides estimated to comprise 1-2% ofthe rock volume. A sub-interval of 73.0 m (from 154.0 m to 227.0 m)contained a greater abundance of sulphide, comprising an estimated2-3% of the rock volume. True widths are estimated to be approximately75% of down-hole intersections.

The core is currently being logged in detail andprepared for assay, with results expected in March 2025.
