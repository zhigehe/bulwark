Churchill Resources Monday provided an update on its 2024 fieldwork results at the Florence Lake nickel project in Labrador.

The company said sampling confirmed nickel and cobalt potential along a 7.5 kilometer strike length to the variably exposed Seahorse Intrusion.

The lone short historical dril hole, TSH96-04, into the eastern margin of the intrusive, returned nickel values in the 0.2% to 0.3% range, with 0.01% cobalt from selected short samples between 30 meters to 100 meters downhole.

"Our 2024 fieldwork has confirmed that the Seahorse Lake Ultramafic Intrusive spans some 7.5km x 1km as suggested by its magnetic signature, and found it to outcrop over several impressively large areas," said chief executive Paul Sobie. "Historical grab sampling by Falconbridge returned pervasive surface nickel assays in the 0.2 to 0.4%Ni range, consistent with similar ultramafic intrusions being evaluated in Ontario, Quebec, B.C., and Alaska."

The company's shares were last seen unchanged at $0.03 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
