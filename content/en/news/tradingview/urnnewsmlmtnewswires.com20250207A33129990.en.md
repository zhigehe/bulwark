The January employment report was solid, with payrolls growth weaker than expected but following large upward revisions to recent months, the unemployment rate lower and hourly earnings growth faster than in the previous month.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 143,000 in January after a 307,000 gain in December and a 261,000 increase in November, both revised up from previous estimates. Private payrolls increased 111,000, below expectations and following a 273,000 gain in December.

Health services jobs and retail trade payrolls both advanced, while the temporary help services and leisure and hospitality sectors shed jobs.

The unemployment rate fell to 4.0% from 4.1% in December, with an increase in the labor force due to rising household employment and a decline in the number of unemployed. Labor force participation increased.

Average hourly earnings were up 0.5% in January, faster than a 0.3% increase in December, keeping the year-over-year rate at 4.1%.

The preliminary Michigan Sentiment index fell to 67.8 in February from 71.1 in January with declines in the readings for both current conditions and the near-term outlook. Sentiment fell across all political, income and age groups. Inflation expectations surged for the one-year horizon to the highest since November 2023.

December wholesale inventories were unrevised from the 0.5% decline reported in the advance estimate following a 0.1% decrease in the previous month.

At the same time, wholesale sales increased 1%, faster than expected, though auto sales fell by 5.1%.

Combined with already released data for the retail and factory levels of distribution, business inventories are on track for a 0.1% decline while business sales are tracking up 0.7%. Both will be released on Feb. 14, when updated retail inventory and sales estimates will be released.

Consumer credit usage surged $40.8 billion in December after a $5.4 billion decline in November.

The Q1 GDPnow estimate from the Atlanta Fed is for a 2.9% gain, unrevised from the previous estimate on Wednesday. The next update is scheduled for Feb. 14.
