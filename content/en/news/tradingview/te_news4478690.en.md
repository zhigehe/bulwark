The dollar index fell below 107.3 on Thursday after President Trump ordered his administration to explore reciprocal tariffs on countries deemed to have unfair trade practices, aiming to rebalance trade relations, a process that could take weeks or months.

The move may target the EU, Japan, and South Korea, particularly in sectors like cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, while also leaving room for negotiations to ease tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

The delay in implementation alleviated fears of immediate retaliatory measures, which had fueled inflation concerns and uncertainty over the Fedâ€™s ability to lower borrowing costs.

Meanwhile, the dollar weakened further as safe-haven demand declined after Trump and Russian President Putin agreed to initiate peace talks on Ukraine, bolstering the euro on optimism over a potential resolution to the conflict.
