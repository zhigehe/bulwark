\*\* Cisco Systems raised its annual revenue forecast on Wednesday, betting on higher demand for its cloud networking gear amid an artificial intelligence boom

\*\* Shares of CSCO up 6.21% at $66.4 in premarket trading

AI-POWERED DATA CENTER HUB

\*\* J.P. Morgan ("overweight," PT: $73) expects that the increasing use of AI by enterprises and the growth of large cloud service providers (hyperscalers) will significantly boost demand for Cisco's portfolio

\*\* Piper Sandler ("neutral," PT: $72) says CSCO is in a good position due to data center upgrades and growth in AI with big cloud providers

\*\* Morgan Stanley ("overweight," PT: $68) sees CSCO's growth in orders related to large-scale web infrastructure (webscale) and improvements in networking capabilities within campus networks, not just in data centers
