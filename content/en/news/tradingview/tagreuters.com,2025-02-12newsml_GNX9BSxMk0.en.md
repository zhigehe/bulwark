New York, NY, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Interpublic Group today announced that the company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend on IPG common stock of $0.33 per share, payable on March 17, 2025, to holders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2025.

Additionally, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase, from time to time, up to $155 million of IPG common stock. The authorization under the new program is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the program announced in 2024. Repurchases under the new program may be effected through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions, or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases under the authorization will depend on market conditions and the company's other funding requirements. The share repurchase program has no expiration date.

The dividend and new repurchase program are consistent with the provisions relating to these matters contained in the Agreement and Plan of Merger the company entered into with Omnicom Group Inc. on December 8, 2024.
