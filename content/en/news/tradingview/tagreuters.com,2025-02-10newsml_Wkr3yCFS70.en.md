*Graveyard of Empires* Opens Host of New Alternate Histories

**STOCKHOLM - 10 FEBRUARY 2025** - Imperial ambitions collide in the challenging lands of Central and South Asia. The British Empire is secure in the Raj and Iraq, but has long held designs on influencing oil rich Iran and unconquerable Afghanistan - also targets of an aggressive Soviet foreign policy from the north. Rewrite the history of a region caught between bowing to a larger alliance and homegrown dreams of national strength. Can you defy the odds and possibly resurrect the glories of a far distant past?

Choose the fate of a nation seeking a new destiny or ancient prestige in ***Graveyard of Empires***, a new country pack for *Hearts of Iron IV.* Follow the historical path of Afghanistan, India, Iran or Iraq or explore dramatic alternate histories with the rebirth of old empires.

***Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires*** includes new content for:

* **Iran**: Iran is a potential great power, hemmed in by the pressure of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. A significant new Focus Tree allows the player to resist the imperial incursions that historically weakened Iran, as well as offering potential for a revived and modern Persian Empire in the heart of Asia.
* **India**: The Raj is the jewel of the British Empire, rich and strategically vital. However, a growing independence movement threatens to disrupt the war effort and dissolve the empire. A large focus tree focused on the struggle of Indian Independence offers many alternate historical paths, including the revival of the East India Company as a corporate nation, as well as the possible freedom of the Princely States, restoration of the Mughal Empire and more.
* **Iraq**: Take control of this British client state and try to chart your own path, embracing the calls for pan-arab nationalism and siding with the axis against the allies. Manage the many competing ethnic and religious factions in Iraq and develop the strategically important oil fields.
* **Afghanistan**: The historic Graveyard of Empires, isolated from the wider war, offers many alternate paths. Continue the historical path of neutrality and isolation, or choose the road of rapid industrialization and building a new power in the mountains of Central Asia.

***Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires*** also includes new art, with more leader portraits, infantry models and unit models.

***Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires*** will be available on March 04, 2025 for the suggested retail price of $14,99/ £12.79/ €14.99 and is also available as a part of the *Hearts of Iron IV Expansion Pass*.
