Siemens's standout positive in its solid first-quarter results was the turnaround in the digital industries segment, Quilter Cheviot analyst Jarek Pominkiewicz says in a research note. The German conglomerate saw a return in order growth in the segment and although orders in Germany were down, the recovery in China is encouraging, the analyst says. Germany is expected to follow suit later in 2025, he adds. "The end of destocking in Chinese automation should support a cyclical recovery in digital industries' automation business," Pominkiewicz says. Shares trade 5.4% higher at 223.60 euros.
