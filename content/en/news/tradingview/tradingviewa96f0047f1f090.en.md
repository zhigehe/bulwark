GE HealthCare, a leading global healthcare solutions provider, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31,Â 2024. The company reported modest revenue growth and significant improvements in net income margins, reflecting strong operational performance and strategic initiatives.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, GE HealthCare reported a 2% year-over-year revenue growth, with revenues reaching $5.3 billion. The net income margin improved significantly to 13.5% from 7.7% in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) saw a substantial increase to $1.57 from $0.88 in the previous year. However, cash flow from operating activities decreased to $913 million from $1.1 billion.

For the full year 2024, the company achieved a 1% year-over-year revenue growth, totaling $19.7 billion. The net income margin rose to 10.1% from 8.0% in the prior year. Diluted EPS for the year was $4.34, up from $3.04 in 2023. Cash flow from operating activities for the year was $2.0 billion, slightly down from $2.1 billion in the previous year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

GE HealthCare's Advanced Visualization Solutions (AVS) and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx) segments were key drivers of revenue growth. The AVS segment saw a 4% year-over-year increase in revenues, while the PDx segment experienced a 9% growth. The company also reported a total book-to-bill ratio of 1.09 times for the fourth quarter, indicating strong demand for its products and services.

Geographically, the U.S. market showed overall strength, contributing significantly to the company's revenue growth. However, market softness in China partially offset these gains.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In 2024, GE HealthCare introduced approximately 40 innovations and closed more than 50 strategic enterprise deals globally. Notable developments include a $138 million investment in a manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and strategic partnerships with Sutter Health in the U.S. and Nuffield Health in the UK. The company also announced plans to acquire the remaining 50% stake in Nihon Medi-Physics, a leading radiopharmaceutical company in Japan.

**Management's Perspective**

Peter Arduini, President and CEO of GE HealthCare, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting strong momentum in orders, backlog, and book-to-bill ratios. He emphasized the company's commitment to its precision care strategy, supported by innovation, productivity initiatives, and commercial execution.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, GE HealthCare has provided guidance for organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, an adjusted EBIT margin of 16.7% to 16.8%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $4.61 to $4.75. The company also expects free cash flow of at least $1.75 billion, reflecting continued demand for its products and services and a measured view of market conditions in China.
