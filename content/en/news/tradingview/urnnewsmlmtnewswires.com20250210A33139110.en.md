Aluminum and steel stocks in the US jumped after Trump said Sunday he would impose 25% tariffs on metal imports. Last week, he delayed plans for 25% general import tariffs on Canada, which was the biggest supplier of aluminum to the US in 2023, ING said in a research note published Monday.

McDonald's was the best performer on the Dow, up 4.8%, after the fast-food giant posted a surprise same-store sales increase for the fourth quarter.

ON Semiconductor shares slumped 8.2%, the steepest decline on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, after the company issued a downbeat quarterly outlook following a fourth-quarter miss.

Some 62% of S&P 500 companies had reported quarterly results through Friday, with earnings jumping nearly 13% year over year on 5.4% revenue growth, Oppenheimer Asset Management said Monday.
