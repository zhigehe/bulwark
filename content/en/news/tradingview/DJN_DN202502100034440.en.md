Sempra Appoints Anya Weaving and Kevin Sagara to Board of Directors

PR Newswire

SAN DIEGO, Feb. 10, 2025

SAN DIEGO, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Sempra today announced the appointments of Anya Weaving and Kevin Sagara to the company's board of directors effective March 1, 2025.

Weaving's extensive investment banking experience, where she advised clients in the oil and gas industry on strategy, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and capital markets transactions, combined with her previous role as a chief financial officer, brings industry knowledge and critical skills in strategic decision-making, financial acumen and governance to the board.

With over 30 years of experience in the energy sector, Sagara brings demonstrated leadership and experience in both regulated utility and non-regulated energy infrastructure operations, including safety, regulatory, M&A, and other legal and governance areas. As a corporate attorney, Sagara played a key role in the merger that created Sempra in 1998.

"Incorporating new views and experience into our boardroom is crucial to our mission of building the leading energy infrastructure company in North America," said Jeffrey W. Martin, Sempra's chairman and CEO. "Anya's investment banking experience and energy industry knowledge is a great complement to the board as we advance our corporate strategy and oversee financial discipline, risk management and ethical practices. Similarly, Kevin's industry success cannot be understated, having led innovations in safety, wildfire mitigation and lower-carbon energy that have helped shape how we better serve customers today and in the future."

Martin added, "In combination, their leadership experience in strategy and capital markets brings critical insights and added experience to our board, helping us deliver what is expected to be a decisive decade of growth for our company."

Weaving also serves on the board of directors of APA Corporation, where she is a member of the audit committee and the corporate responsibility, governance and nominating committee. She is the former vice chair of global natural resources, investment banking for Bank of America. Prior to his retirement from Sempra in 2023, Sagara served as group president of Sempra California, where he served as chair of San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) and Southern California Gas Company. He previously held roles as CEO of SDGE and president of Sempra Renewables.

With the appointments of Weaving and Sagara, Sempra will have 11 directors with four having been newly elected over the past five years, reflecting the company's commitment to periodic board refreshment to bring fresh and diverse perspectives into the boardroom. Weaving will serve on the board's audit committee and compensation and talent development committee. Sagara will serve on the board's safety, sustainability and technology committee.
