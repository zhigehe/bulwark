The dollar index held its recent decline around 107 on Friday and was on track to lose about 1% for the week, pressured by easing trade concerns and expectations for a softer personal consumption expenditures price index later this month.

The currency dropped 0.8% on Thursday after President Donald Trump directed his administration to explore reciprocal tariffs on countries with unfair trade practices, although the tariffs would not be implemented immediately.

The delay in action helped ease fears of immediate retaliatory measures, which had sparked inflation concerns and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's ability to cut borrowing costs.

Meanwhile, the latest producer inflation report came in hotter-than-expected, following strong consumer inflation data the day before.

However, the components suggest that the core PCE inflation, which the Fed favors, will likely come in lower than anticipated later this month.
