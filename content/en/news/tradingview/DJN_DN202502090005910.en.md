President Trump predicted that Kansas City will win the Super Bowl, during a pregame interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. "When a quarterback wins as much as he's won--I have to go with Kansas City," Trump said after praising Patrick Mahomes.

Trump also noted that the quarterback's wife, Brittany Lynne Mahomes, has been supportive of Trump and his MAGA movement. "He has a phenomenal wife," Trump said.
