Bitcoin's pullback to the $96,000 zone from a peak of $109,000 in January 2025 reflects a bearish trend amid a market mood shaped by macroeconomic factors, says Antonio Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com. Amid geopolitical uncertainty and stock market fluctuations, institutional investors have reduced their exposure to crypto in search of safer assets, he says. Stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data and Trump tariffs have contributed to volatility, with pressure on bitcoin exacerbated by tightening regulations in various jurisdictions, he adds. However, this could present an opportunity to accumulate. The analyst notes that the bitcoin ecosystem continues to show signs of long-term growth, with institutional adoption and blockchain infrastructure advancing. Bitcoin is last at $96,713.
