Mexican airport operator GAP on Tuesday announced a 52-billion-peso ($2.53 billion) investment spread across five years, part of what it described as a development plan that aims to support economic growth and the country's key tourism sector.

GAP operates a dozen airports in Mexico, including hubs in the major beach resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos, among the country's top draws for international visitors.

In a statement, GAP noted that the plan also includes the construction of a new airport terminal in Guadalajara, one of Mexico's largest cities, as well as an additional roadway to improve connectivity to the airport.

The plan calls for the completion of a new terminal at the Puerto Vallarta airport, which GAP said will double the facility's capacity.

Expansions of existing terminals at the company's hubs in Tijuana, just south of the U.S. border, as well as in Los Cabos, are also envisioned as part of the investment plan, which overall should boost capacity at GAP's airports in Mexico by 50%, according to the statement.

The airport operator also runs a pair of facilities in Jamaica, including at Montego Bay, but the company's statement did not detail any new investments in its operations in the Caribbean country.
