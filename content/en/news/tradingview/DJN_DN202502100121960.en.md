Shares of Amkor Technology dropped after the provider of semiconductor packaging, design and test services posted lower-than-expected sales for the fourth quarter.

The stock was down 11% to $21.80 in postmarket trading. Through Monday's close, shares have fallen 23% over the past 12 months.

The company said fourth-quarter revenue fell to $1.63 billion from $1.75 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast higher sales of $1.66 billion.

The company also reported a quarterly net profit of $106 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $118 million, or 48 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Chief Executive Giel Rutten said weakness in the automotive and industrial, and communications end markets contributed to a full-year decline in sales.

"We remain confident in our long-term strategy and continue to invest in technology for advanced packaging and our broad geographic footprint with a focus on industry megatrends," he said.
