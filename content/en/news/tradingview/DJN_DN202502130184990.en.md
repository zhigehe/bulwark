Honda Motor estimates that Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports to the U.S., which will likely trigger retaliatory action by the two countries, would cost the company about $4.6 billion annually. About one-third of Honda cars sold in the American market are imported from Canada and Mexico, according to Honda's executive vice president Shinji Aoyama. "We are taking short-term measures, such as bringing production in Mexico and Canada to the U.S., as much as possible, by the end of February," Aoyama said at a Thursday news conference. "In the medium term, we are also preparing to consider slightly changing the allocation of models." (megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com)
