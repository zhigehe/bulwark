Greenheart Gold on Monday provided an update on its early-stage exploration programs at the Igab and Majorodam projects in Suriname.

The company received positive results from channel sampling of an exposed outcrop at the Lemon Tree prospect within the Igab Project. These channel samples, include IGBT25-003 which intersected 31.0 meters grading 1.36 grams per ton of gold (g/t Au). This channel sample follows up on an initial 3 meter channel sample IGBT24-002, which graded at 1.27 g/t Au.

Last September, Greenheart Gold entered into a binding Heads of Agreement (HoA) with a private Surinamese company to acquire a 100% interest in the Igab Project.

At the Majorodam Project Greenheart Gold completed infill soil geochemical sampling over the Heuvel and Helling targets. Results from the infill program continue to be "very encouraging," further expanding and adding definition to the Heuvel and Helling targets, the company said.

The company's shares were las seen down $0.02 to $0.82 on the TSX Venture Exchange.
