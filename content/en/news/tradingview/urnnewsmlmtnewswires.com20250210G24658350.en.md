Keystone Positive Change Investment Trust said Monday the board hopes to reconvene meetings as soon as practicable to move forward with its scheme of reconstruction and members' voluntary winding-up proposal.

A circular on the plan for an uncapped cash exit or a rollover into a fund will be published in due course. Shareholders who opt for the former option are expected to receive payment in April.

The company was supposed to vote on the proposal Jan. 27 but the meeting was adjourned after shareholder Saba Capital Management asked for a separate meeting. The latter was held Feb. 3 and the proposals including a board overhaul were rejected by a majority.
