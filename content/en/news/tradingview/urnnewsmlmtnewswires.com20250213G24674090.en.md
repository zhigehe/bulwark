Hong Kong stocks retreated from a four-month high in the previous session to end Thursday's trade lower due to fears of delayed rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve.

The Hang Seng Index slid 0.20%, or 43.55 points, to close at 21,814.37. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 0.69%, or 55.45 points, to 8,002.63.

The local equities market took cues from an overnight decline on Wall Street following higher-than-expected US inflation data, which reinforced the US Fed's decision to avoid slashing interest rates in the near future, according to a Reuters report.

The US consumer price index rose 0.5% in January, its largest increase since August 2023. The core CPI, which climbed 0.4%, also surpassed market expectations.

In corporate news, shares of Alibaba Group rose nearly 3% after its chairman, Joseph Tsai, confirmed a partnership with Apple to provide Chinese iPhone users with AI technology.
