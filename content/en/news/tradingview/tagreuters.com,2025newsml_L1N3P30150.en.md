Key points:

* KOSPI flat, foreigners net sellers
* Korean won weakens against dollar
* South Korea benchmark bond yield rises

Round-up of South Korean financial markets:

\*\* South Korean shares were flat on Wednesday, as traders were in a wait-and-see mood ahead of a key U.S. inflation data and details of more tariff measures.

\*\* The benchmark KOSPI index was down 0.83 points, or 0.03%, at 2,538.22 as of 0037 GMT. It hit a near three-week high on Tuesday.

\*\* U.S. inflation data for January is scheduled to be reported later on Wednesday, a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was not in a hurry to further ease monetary policy.

\*\* U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would announce reciprocal tariffs over the next two days on all countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.

\*\* Among the top 15 trading partners of the U.S., South Korea imposes tariffs at the second-highest rate after India, but their free trade agreements eliminate nearly all tariffs.

\*\* In the South Korean stock market, six of the top 10 index heavyweights are from chip, auto and biopharmaceutical sectors.

\*\* South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok on Tuesday said his government would seek talks with the U.S. administration about Washington's tariffs to reflect the interests of its companies.

\*\* Chipmakers and biopharma manufacturers fell, but battery makers rose. Automakers were mixed.

\*\* Of the total 927 traded issues, 369 shares advanced, while 473 declined.

\*\* Foreigners were net sellers of shares worth 154.1 billion won ($106.21 million).

\*\* The won was quoted at 1,453.7 per dollar on the onshore settlement platform , down 0.10%.

\*\* The most liquid three-year Korean treasury bond yield (KR3YT=RR) rose by 1.4 basis points to 2.645%, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose by 3.1 bps to 2.869%.

($1 = 1,450.9500 won)
