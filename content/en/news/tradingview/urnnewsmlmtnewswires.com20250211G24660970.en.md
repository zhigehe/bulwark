Emirates Integrated Telecommunications (DFM:DU), d/b/a du, on Monday proposed to distribute 98% of earnings to shareholders, boosting 2024 dividend to a historical high after focused strategy execution led to a record profit and revenue beat.

The Dubai-listed telecommunications company's board recommended a final dividend of 0.34 Emirati dirham per share, which together with the interim dividend of 0.20 dirham per share takes the full-year dividend up 59% year over year to 0.54 dirham per share, the highest dividend in du's history and the maximum permissible per-share dividend in the company's policy. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an annual dividend of 0.46 dirham per share.

For 2023, du paid an interim dividend of 0.13 dirham per share and a final dividend of 0.21 dirham per share, bringing the total to 0.34 dirham per share.

The payout was supported by a yearly surge in profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2024, to a record 2.49 billion dirhams from 1.67 billion dirhams. The FactSet consensus estimate for net income was 2.56 billion dirhams. The telecom operator attributed the 49.1% annual jump in net profit to its EBITDA performance, efficient cash management, normalized level of depreciation and amortization, and positive impact from federal royalty and tax.

Meanwhile, revenue rose to 14.64 billion dirhams from 13.64 billion dirhams a year ago and the FactSet consensus estimate of 14.46 billion dirhams. Citing a supportive environment, a growing market share in mobile and fixed services, and the expansion of du's information and communication technology offerings, du said the 7.3% revenue growth surpassed the guidance of a 5% to 7% increase.

Moving on, the company, which is transitioning from a traditional telecom operator to a comprehensive digital services company, anticipates further innovation and growth from its strategic partnerships with telcos Orange and Telefónica .

"Our outlook remains positive as we continue to progress on our transformation journey, prioritise emerging technologies, and strengthen our position in the telecom and ICT sectors to meet evolving market demands," Chairman Malek Sultan Al Malek said. "We are confident in our ability to drive sustained growth and value for our shareholders while shaping the UAE's digitally empowered future."
