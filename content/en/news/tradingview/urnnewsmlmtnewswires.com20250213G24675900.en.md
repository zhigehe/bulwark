Moody's on Thursday lowered Ørsted's long-term issuer rating to Baa2 from Baa1 and changed its outlook to stable from negative.

The ratings downgrade highlights the agency's expectations that the Danish renewable energy company will be unable to recover from its "weak" credit metrics in the next two to three years.

The outlook, meanwhile, supports projections of progress in Ørsted's construction and asset disposal programs, as well as the company's ability to deliver projects despite market challenges in the US.
