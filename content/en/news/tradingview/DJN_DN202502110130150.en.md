JGB futures fall in the early Tokyo session, with the Japanese government bond market likely to track overnight price declines in U.S. Treasurys. Both JGBs and Treasurys tend to move in tandem. For today, focus may be on the Finance Ministry's scheduled auction of 250 billion yen in 10-year inflation-indexed sovereign debt. This auction could result in a satisfactory-to-solid outcome, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities' fixed income strategists say in a recent research report. "We anticipate a certain amount of demand as a hedge against continued high inflation," the strategists add. 10-year JGB futures are 0.16 yen lower at 139.86 yen. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
