Canada will release the building permit data for December at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, noted Bank of Montreal (BMO).

The bank is looking for December building permits to rebound 2% month over month after faltering by almost 6% in the prior month.

The euro is outperforming most of the majors alongside the Danish krone, while the Japanese yen is at the back of the currency pack, followed closely by the Canadian dollar and South Korean won, added BMO.
