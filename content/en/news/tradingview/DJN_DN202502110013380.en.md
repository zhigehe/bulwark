China and other Asian countries have so far escaped the brunt of the U.S. tariff pains, but this is likely the exception, not the rule going forward, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Securities writes in a note. It is premature for Asia to find solace from the latest steel and aluminum tariffs, which will impact key exporters like Canada and Mexico for now, as China and the region were not Trump's main targets of these tariffs in the first place, Varathan says. Further tariffs will be rolled out incrementally, with the bigger picture for these policies still ultimately aimed at China, and the rest of Asia will inevitably be affected given extensive supply chains, Varathan says.
