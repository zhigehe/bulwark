* Japanese rubber futures fell to a one-month low on Monday as tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump added to concerns of a global trade war, while improving weather in top producer Thailand eased supply concerns.
* The Osaka Exchange (OSE) rubber contract for July delivery , was down 5.7 yen, or 1.53%, at 368 yen ($2.42) per kg as of 0212 GMT.
* Earlier in the session, prices hit 366 yen, their lowest since January 10.
* The rubber contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) for May delivery shed 200 yuan, or 1.14%, to 17,290 yuan ($2,366.55) per metric ton.
* The most active February butadiene rubber contract on the SHFE (SHBRv1) fell 380 yuan, or 2.55%, to 14,495 yuan ($1,983.99) per ton.
* The northeast monsoon will weaken from February 11-15, with isolated light rains in the South, top rubber producer Thailand's meteorological agency said on its website.
* Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries by Monday or Tuesday.
* While he did not identify which countries would be hit with new tariffs, Trump said auto tariffs remained on the table.
* Automobile sales could influence the intensity of automobile manufacturing, which involves using rubber-made tyres.
* Additional 10% tariffs across all Chinese imports came into effect last week, prompting swift retaliation from Beijing with levies on various goods and renewing a trade war between the world's top two economies.
* In top consumer China, consumer inflation accelerated to its fastest in five months in January while producer price deflation persisted, reflecting mixed consumer spending and weak factory activity.
