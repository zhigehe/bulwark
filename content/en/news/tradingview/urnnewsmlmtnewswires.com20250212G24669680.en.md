Fitch on Wednesday affirmed Atlas Copco's (ATCO-A.ST, ATCO-B.ST) A+ long-term issuer default rating, with a stable outlook, mainly driven by the company's strong financial metrics and solid diversified operations.

The rating agency said the affirmation also reflects its expectations that the Sweden-based industrial group's global presence and broad product range shield it from the cyclicality of its end markets. It also expects the company to sustain its robust operating margins and high free cash flow generation, among other factors.
