RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on WildBrain Ltd. to $2.50 from $2.

Analyst Drew McReynolds maintained a Sector Perform rating on shares of the Canadian entertainment company following its quarterly results.

"Q2/25 results were in line with our forecast while the fiasco 2025 outlook including Canadian Television Broadcasting was reiterated," McReynolds said in a note to clients.

"Following upward revisions to our Global Licensing forecast for the second consecutive quarter, our price target increases," the analyst said.
