China's shares rebounded at the close of Friday's trade as DeepSeek continues to boost investor sentiment, while the central bank committed to keep the exchange rate stable.

The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4%, or 14.24 points, to cap the trading week at 3,346.72. The Shenzhen Component Index climbed 1.2%, or 122.83 points, to 10,749.46.

Investors continue to vie for Chinese tech equities after the launch of large language model DeepSeek.

Moreover, the People's Bank of China pledge to keep the exchange rate stable also lifted market sentiment, despite the US' plans to impose reciprocal tariffs.

The reciprocal tariffs will be charged on every country that imposes duties on US goods.

In corporate news, Daan Gene soared 10% as its unit obtained a medical device registration certificate from the Chinese drug administration for an assay kit detecting syphilis treponema.

Hainan Haiyao climbed 3.7% after announcing that the flufenidone capsules developed by a unit were included in the Chinese drug administration's list of breakthrough therapeutic products.

Super Telecom rose 3.2% after appointing Guo Yanqi as chief financial officer to succeed Hu Hongyue.
