The offshore yuan ticked lower to around 7.31 per dollar as investors remained cautious amid growing concerns over an escalating trade war.

On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and hinted at reciprocal tariffs on other countries.

This decision adds to trade tensions, with Trump's administration already imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% levies on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are currently on hold.

In response, China imposed new tariffs on U.S. imports, including 15% on coal and LNG, and 10% on crude oil, agricultural equipment, and vehicles, effective February 10,Â 2025.

However, Trump revealed in an interview that he has spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office, highlighting their "very good personal relationship," though he didn't share specifics.

This conversation between the two leaders is seen as crucial for potentially easing or delaying the ongoing trade tariffs.
