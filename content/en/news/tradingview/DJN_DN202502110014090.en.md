By Anthony O. Goriainoff

Belluscura said it raised around 5.4 million pounds ($6.7 million) via a fundraise and an oversubscribed retail offer.

The London-listed developer of medical devices said Tuesday that it raised around 4.7 million pounds via a fundraise, of which around 4.0 million pounds are conditional on certain resolutions being passed by shareholders at its general meeting on Feb. 28.

The company said it also raised 675,000 pounds via a retail offer and that this was above the original 500,000 pounds estimate it announced on Friday. The company said it will issue 33.75 million retail offer shares at the 2 pence issue price, conditional upon the resolutions being passed.

Shares stood at 2.25 pence at the end of trading on Monday.

Belluscura said the net proceeds of the fundraise were around 4.3 million pounds and that these will be used to purchase product inventory, for general working capital purposes as well as to bolster its balance sheet.
