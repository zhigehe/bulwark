EssilorLuxottica looks set to benefit from innovation in technological products, Bryan Garnier analyst Cedric Rossi writes in a note. The Franco-Italian eyewear group booked fourth-quarter sales of 6.78 billion euros, 9.2% higher on year at constant currency, helped by the success of its tech products. Ray-Ban Meta wearables, which incorporate an AI assistant and cameras, reached 2 million units sold since their launch in 2023, with a strong acceleration in 2024. The analyst expects escalating sales and profit contributions from technological products across lenses, smart eyewear, audiology and medtech categories. "This new wave of technology is just beginning," the analyst says. Shares rise 5.7% to 291.60 euros. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)
