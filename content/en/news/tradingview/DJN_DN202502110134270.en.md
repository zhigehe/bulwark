According to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, January CPO output was 17% lower on month to 1.24 million tons, it notes. The lower palm oil supply could help support prices, it says. Traders could initiate long position if price retraces to MYR4,550/ton-MYR4,540/ton, it says. AmInvestment Bank pegs CPO support at 4,515 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,696 ringgit/ton.
