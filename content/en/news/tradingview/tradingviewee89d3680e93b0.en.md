Amesite Inc., a leading provider of artificial intelligence software products, has released its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The report provides a detailed overview of the company's financial performance and strategic business initiatives, reflecting its ongoing efforts to expand its customer base and enhance its technological offerings.

**Financial Highlights**

**Net Revenue**: $24,010

The company experienced a decrease in revenue compared to the previous year, reflecting a strategic pivot to grow the customer base while reducing risk and losses.

**Loss from Operations**: $(2,058,213)

Operating expenses increased due to higher general and administrative costs, despite reductions in technology and content development expenses.

**Net Loss**: $(2,029,682)

The net loss increased by approximately 11% compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to increased Board stock compensation and professional fees.

**Basic and diluted loss per share**: $(0.73)

This reflects the company's ongoing challenges in achieving profitability.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments**

For the six months ended December 31, 2024, one customer represented 94% of total revenue, indicating a high dependency on a single client for revenue generation.

**New Product Launches**

The company launched the NurseMagic™ app, which is designed to streamline nursing documentation and enhance patient communication, marking a significant expansion into the healthcare technology sector.

**Operational Strategy Shift**

The company has pivoted its strategy to focus on growing its customer base with a fee-per-course model for community colleges, moving away from larger, cash-upfront deals that were not sustainable.

**Technology Development**

The company has focused new development work on delivering AI tools to markets that demand increased capability, with the NurseMagic™ app being the first of these new offerings.

**Future Outlook**

Management plans to generate cash through financing transactions, including potential offerings of common stock, to address the company's ongoing cash flow challenges and support future operations.
