Next week's policy meeting at the Reserve Bank of Australia will be among the tensest in living memory. While the case to cut interest rates is strong due to falling core inflation, it's not yet overwhelming given the strength of hiring and evidence that consumer spending is in slow recovery. But the RBA board will be highly conscious of the political consequences of both cutting or not cutting, feeling it is damned to attract waves of criticism. With polls showing support for the ruling Labor Party is fragile at best as voters feel the sting of rising living costs, the RBA's verdict could be key to the election due before mid-May.
