Singapore on Thursday announced its first set of measures to strengthen the country's equities market development, including proposals to introduce tax incentives to spur more listings and investments in the city state's equities market.

The country's equities market review group said in a statement that it has submitted the proposals to the Prime Minister and finance ministry.

Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, set up the review group in August last year to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in the country.

The review group said on Thursday the first set of measures also included proposals to encourage the launch and growth of funds with substantial investment in domestic equities.

It added that it will provide a fuller update on its first set of measures on February 21, and continue to work on the next set of measures, which will be presented in the second half of 2025.
