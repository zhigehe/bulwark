Firefly Neuroscience shares surged more than 53% in recent Tuesday trading after the medical technology company said it has been selected to participate in the Nvidia Connect program.

Firefly said it will use the chipmaker's tools to support its project to build a foundation model of the human brain using its Brain Network Analytics technology platform.

Participation in the Nvidia program will provide access to technical training and engineering guidance as well as discounts on Nvidia products, Firefly said.
