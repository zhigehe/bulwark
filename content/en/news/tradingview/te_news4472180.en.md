The annual inflation rate in Colombia edged up to 5.22% in January 2025, slightly above December’s three-year low of 5.2% and surpassing market expectations of 5.11%.

The uptick was driven by faster price increases in food (+4.49% vs. +3.31% in December) and restaurants and hotels (+8.06% vs. +7.87%), while transportation (+4.9% vs. +5.19%) and health expenses (+5.47% vs. +5.54%) saw slower gains.

Housing costs also rose at a more moderate pace (+6.48% vs. +6.96%).

Meanwhile, education costs surged by 10.62% for the third straight month.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices climbed 0.94%, the highest increase since February, accelerating from December’s 0.46% rise and slightly exceeding market forecasts of 0.82%.
