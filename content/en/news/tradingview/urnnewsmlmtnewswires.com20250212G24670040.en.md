Japan Display has invested in OLEDWorks, a US-based company involved in multi-stack OLED technology, as part of a partnership to establish an advanced display production facility in the US, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The planned US fab will focus on high-performance displays for defense, automotive, and medical applications.

Japan Display Chief Executive Officer Scott Callon said the collaboration aims to create a "secure, sustainable, and innovative ecosystem" for advanced display manufacturing in the US.

The company expects a limited earnings impact for FY25/3 but sees long-term growth potential.
