The euro could rise further on relief that President Trump's latest tariff plans aren't immediate, ING analyst Chris Turner says in a note. With tariffs to be assessed on a country-by-country basis in a report expected on April 1, trading partners have time to fine-tune strategies. However, the outcome could be "eye-wateringly large tariffs against some of the key countries with which the U.S. runs a goods deficit." The EU will "certainly be in the cross-hairs." That means the euro's gains should be limited to $1.0535-$1.0575 near-term, and it still risks falling to parity in the second quarter, he says. The euro rises to a two-and-a-half-week high of $1.0482, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
