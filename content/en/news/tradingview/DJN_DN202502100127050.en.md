IOI Corp. is projected to post sequentially stronger 2Q FY 2025 earnings, mainly supported by its plantation segment, says UOB Kay Hian analyst Lester Siew in a note. The company's 2Q core net profit is forecast to have risen 15%-25% on quarter, Siew says. The plantation segment benefited from a sharp rise in selling prices toward late 2024, Siew says. UOB KH thinks the current risk-reward tradeoff for IOI is fair, partly due to its plantations' capped exposure to high crude palm oil prices. UOB KH maintains a hold rating and target price of MYR3.80. Shares last closed at MYR3.75. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
