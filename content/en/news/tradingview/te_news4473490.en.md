U.S. cotton futures edged higher to nearly 67 cents per pound, supported by rising oil prices and a strong weekly export sales report.

According to the USDA’s weekly report released on February 6th, U.S. export sales of upland cotton totaled 221,100 running bales for the week ending January 30, marking the highest level of the season, despite weak net sales commitments.

This represented a 44% increase from the previous week and a 12% rise from the four-week average.

Meanwhile, the market remains cautious, with renewed concerns about U.S. trade policies and their effects on global cotton demand, alongside broader economic uncertainties.

Traders are awaiting the Department of Agriculture's upcoming supply and demand report, which is expected to provide further insights into the cotton outlook.
