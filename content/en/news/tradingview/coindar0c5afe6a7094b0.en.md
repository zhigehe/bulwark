**QKC Info**

QuarkChain is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to address the scalability issues faced by many of the current blockchain systems.

QuarkChain employs a two-tiered structure. The first layer consists of independent blockchains (shards) to process transactions. The second layer, the root chain, confirms the blocks from these shards. QuarkChain supports cross-shard transactions, allowing for transactions between different shards. Thanks to this structure, QuarkChain can achieve high throughput, processing thousands of transactions per second.

The projectâ€™s token is called QKC and is used for governance, transaction fees, and participation within the ecosystem.
