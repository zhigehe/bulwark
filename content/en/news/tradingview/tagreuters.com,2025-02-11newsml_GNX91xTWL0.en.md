EDMUNDSTON, New Brunswick, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Acadian Timber Corp. (“Acadian”) has signed an agreement to purchase assets of A & A Brochu, LLC (“A & A Brochu”) and its affiliates for a total price of U.S. $4.8 million. The assets include harvesting, trucking, and road building equipment, as well as related real estate, in the Millinocket, Maine region.

“We are pleased with the opportunity to purchase this turnkey operation,” commented Adam Sheparski, President and Chief Executive Officer. “A & A Brochu has provided contractor services to Acadian for many years. The transaction will address the historical harvesting capacity challenges in Maine and enable greater control over costs as well as sustainable forestry practices, while allowing Acadian to invest in the communities in which we live and work.”

The asset purchase agreement was signed on February 10, 2025 and the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2025.
