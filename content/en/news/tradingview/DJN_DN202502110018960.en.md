The euro could weaken further as U.S.-eurozone interest rate differentials move against the single currency ahead of potential U.S. trade tariffs, ING's Chris Turner says in a note. President Trump's announcement Monday of a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports hit the EU, he says. Europe is now bracing for tariffs on other sectors, like autos, although politicians are likely concerned about broader tariffs. "Whatever today's news on tariffs, wide rate spreads justify the euro continuing to trade near $1.03 and undermine the need for any corrective bounce." The euro rises 0.1% to $1.0315 but could fall towards the $1.0250-60 range or lower if Trump delivers new tariffs, he says. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
