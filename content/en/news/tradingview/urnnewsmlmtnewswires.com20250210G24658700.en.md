Makino Milling Machine said it is evaluating Nidec Corp.'s proposal to acquire all its shares and make it a wholly owned subsidiary, according to a Monday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The machine tool manufacturer sent an initial letter of inquiry to Nidec to seek additional details on the offer, including the expected synergies and financial terms.

Makino said it is assessing whether the proposed acquisition aligns with long-term corporate value and shareholder interests.

An independent financial adviser is reviewing the offer, and the company is considering alternative options. Makino also plans to send further questions after analyzing additional materials disclosed by Nidec on Jan. 23.
