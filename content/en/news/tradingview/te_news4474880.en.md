The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note extended its increase toward the 4.55% mark on Tuesday, rebounding from the seven-week low of 4.4% touched on February 5th after Chairman Powell reiterated that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to continue lowering interest rates.

In a testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the Chairman noted that the US economy remains strong and the labor market remains robust at a historical level, indicating that the central bank still has leeway to continue tuning policy against inflationary risks.

Fresh insights on price growth is due tomorrow with the key CPI report, expected to show that headline and core inflation remained relatively unchanged.

In the meantime, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel to begin next month, adding to lingering concerns of higher input costs for manufacturers.
