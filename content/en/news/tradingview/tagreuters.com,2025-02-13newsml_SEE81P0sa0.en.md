SARAJEVO (Bosnia and Herzegovina), February 13 (SeeNews) - The parliament of Bosnia’s Brcko District approved a budget for 2025 with a 6.7 million marka ($3.6 million/3.4 million euro) deficit, it said.

Revenues are planned at 351.9 million marka and expenditures are estimated at 358.6 million marka, a video posted on the website of the Brcko District parliament on Wednesday showed.

The 2025 budget deficit is 130.7 million marka lower than in 2024, and 36.2 million marka lower than in 2023.

The budget deficit will be financed through loans, documents on the parliament's website show.

Brcko District is a self-governing administrative unit in Bosnia and Herzegovina, formally part of both autonomous Bosnian entities - the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic.
