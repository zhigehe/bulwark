JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk continues to demonstrate resilience amid economic challenges, recording a consolidated net profit of IDR 60.64 trillion in 2024. BRI President Director Sunarso shared this achievement during the 2024 Financial Performance Press Conference in Jakarta (12/2).

"As of the end of 2024, BRI successfully posted a net profit of IDR 60.64 trillion. This achievement reflects BRI's resilience and ability to consistently create value for shareholders, stakeholders, and the wider community while maintaining its support for MSMEs," Sunarso said.

By December 2024, BRI's total assets grew 1.42% year-on-year (yoy) to IDR 1,992.98 trillion, driven by selective and quality loan disbursement, primarily in the MSME segment, which accounted for 81.97% of total loans (IDR 1,110.37 trillion). Loan disbursement reached IDR 1,354.64 trillion, up 6.97% yoy, while the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio improved from 2.95% to 2.78%. BRI also maintained strong reserves with an NPL Coverage ratio of 215.01%.
