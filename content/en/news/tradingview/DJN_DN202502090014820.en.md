Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts outdueled Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl, taking home most-valuable-player honors as his team delivered a dominant performance over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Eagles star threw for 221 yards and rushed for 72, scoring three touchdowns. It was his second Super Bowl and his first win, after having lost to the Chiefs in 2023. Mahomes, Chiefs' quarterback, had won the previous two Super Bowl MVP awards.
