Key points:

* German DAX futures -0.5%
* French CAC 40 futures -0.3%
* UK FTSE futures flat

Well, the drop ahead of the open only offers a bit of a scratch to the gains from yesterday. European indices are still sitting comfortably higher on the week itself and poised for a seventh straight week of gains. US futures are a touch higher though, with S&P 500 futures up 0.1% currently. The attention will turn towards the US retail sales data later as well as any more Trump headlines before the weekend.
