SAN CARLOS, Calif., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Iovance” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on innovating, developing, and delivering novel polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (“TIL”) therapies for patients with cancer, today announced that on February 10, 2025 (the “Date of Grant”), the Company approved the grant of inducement stock options and restricted stock units covering an aggregate of up to 305,000 shares of Iovance’s common stock to Daniel Kirby, the Company’s new Chief Commercial Officer.

The awards were granted under Iovance’s Amended and Restated 2021 Inducement Plan, which was adopted on September 22, 2021, and amended and restated on January 12, 2022, March 13, 2023, February 26, 2024, and November 22, 2024, and provides for the granting of equity awards to new employees of Iovance by the Company’s compensation committee in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Each of the stock options granted as referenced in this press release has an exercise price equal to the closing price of Iovance’s common stock on the Date of Grant. Each stock option and restricted stock unit vests over a three-year period, with one-third of the shares vesting on the first anniversary of the employee’s start date (the “First Vesting Date”) and the remaining shares vesting in eight quarterly installments over the next two years, commencing with the first quarter following the First Vesting Date. In addition, certain of these restricted stock awards may vest upon the achievement of performance milestones based on specified financial results rather than time-based vesting. The foregoing vesting is subject to continued employment with the Company through the applicable vesting dates.
