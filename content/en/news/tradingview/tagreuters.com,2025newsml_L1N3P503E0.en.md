Copper prices rose to three-month highs on Friday, helped by supply tightness and recent China data, while market players assessed the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which will not be immediately implemented.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.3% to $9,511 a ton, its highest since November 8, 2024.

Shanghai Futures Exchange copper rose 0.4% to 77,680 yuan, the highest since November 6, 2024.

The premium for U.S. Comex copper futures (HGc2) over the LME contract rocketed to a record high earlier this week.

Treatment charges, the fees miners pay to smelters for converting raw materials into metal, have been declining, indicating a material shortage.

The Fastmarkets copper TC/RC index on Wednesday hit record lows at minus $12.50 per ton and minus 1.25 cents per lb, compared to plus $20 a year ago.

"The metal continues to shrug off the uncertain economic backdrop, driven by US tariffs and China's sluggish property sector," ANZ Research said in a note.

"China's retail sales and industrial production are up, and its manufacturing... back in the expansion zone, bolstered by government growth initiatives."

Data last week showed the Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index, an indicator of China's manufacturing activity, stood at 51.0 in January, staying above the 50-mark that indicates expansion.

Trump's plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports have stoked concerns of a major global trade war.

Trump threatened duties last week without providing further details.

Three-month aluminium on the LME was up 0.5% to $2,616 a ton.

Zinc was up 0.8% to $2,868.5, tin was up 0.8% at $32,275, lead added 0.3% to $1,992.5 and nickel edged 0.6% higher to $15,470.

SHFE aluminium rose 0.2% to 20,595 yuan a ton, SHFE copper rose 0.4% to 77,680 yuan, nickel was flat at 124,380 yuan, zinc climbed 0.6% to 23,935 yuan, lead added 0.3% to 17,185 yuan and tin was up 0.6% to 258,910 yuan.
