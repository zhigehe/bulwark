New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - February 10, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC ("Polestar" or the "Company") and reminds investors of the **March 31, 2025 deadline** to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Polestar's financial statements during the Class Period were materially misstated; (2) Polestar understated its internal control weaknesses; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about Polestar's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

On January 16, 2025, before the market opened, Polestar filed a current report on Form 6-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In this current report, Polestar announced that it had been concluded that "the Company's previously issued audited financial statements included within Annual Reports on Form 20-F for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 (the "Audited Affected Financials") and the unaudited interim financial information included within Current Reports on Form 6-K for the quarterly periods ending on and falling between September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2024 (the "Unaudited Affected Financials" and together with the Audited Affected Financials, the "Affected Financials") contain errors that warrant restatement of the Audited Affected Financials and the interim financial information for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2024."

On this news, Polestar Class A American Depositary Shares fell 11% in intraday on January 16, 2025.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Polestar's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.
