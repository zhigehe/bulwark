(Oslo, 14 February 2025) Axactor ASA (Axactor, OSE: ACR) announce fourthquarterand full year financial results.

The figures for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2024 are heavilyimpacted by two key events in the final quarter of the year, which wereannounced 19 November 2024:

- Axactor sold Spanish NPL portfolios for a gross sales price of EUR 83million.The impact on cash metrics from the sale was substantial and elevates thegrossrevenue and cash EBITDA figures. The transaction was made at an averagepremiumof 2% over book value, and thus have limited impact on total revenue and thenetresult. The improvement in cash metrics nonetheless ensures compliance withbondcovenants and enables deleveraging.

- Axactor made significant downward revisions to its forward collection curvesafter seeing a challenging collection environment across most of its markets.The net impact from these NPL revaluations for the quarter ended at EUR -104million, affecting the total revenue, net result and book values for theperiod.The revaluations do not have any cash impact, and the revalued claims remainvalid and continue to accrue interests where applicable. If the collectionenvironment improves beyond the Group's expectations, the claims are stillcollectible and may represent an upside potential. Axactor has a total of EUR16.5 billion in debt under management within the NPL segment per the end of2024, spread across 964 thousand individual claims.

Despite recognizing a significant NPL revaluation, Axactor's balance sheetremains tangible and strong with a healthy equity ratio of 26%. The proceedsfrom the Spanish portfolio sale were partly used to buy back bond loans atsub-par values, as Axactor continue deleveraging and preparing for theupcomingloan maturities in 2026.

"The portfolio sale in Spain at attractive terms, in addition to ourrepurchaseof the 2026 bond, demonstrates Axactor's commitment to value creatingtransactions such as potential further accretive bond repurchases andportfoliodivestures in 2025," says CEO Johnny Tsolis, and continues:

"Although our near-term outlook has been taken down, we have alsosignificantlyreduced the risk in our balance sheet. The revaluations will help us improveourcollection performance versus forecasts and we have created covenant headroomthrough the Spanish portfolio sale. We expect reduced interest expenses fromboth falling IBOR curves and reduced debt, and will continue our focus oncost,collections and efficiency, which in total provides a solid outlook for thecoming quarters."
