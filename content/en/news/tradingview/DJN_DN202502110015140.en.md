TUI posted an increase in earnings that beat analysts' expectations after higher customer numbers boosted revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal year.

The German travel operator said it made 50.9 million euros ($52.5 million) in underlying earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter ended Dec. 31 compared with 6 million euros a year earlier.

Underlying EBIT at constant currency--the company's preferred metric, which strips out exceptional and other one-off items--jumped to 65.7 million euros from 6.0 million euros.

Analysts had expected first-quarter underlying EBIT at 16 million euros on 4.49 billion euros in revenue, according to Visible Alpha consensus.

The company said the result reflected the performance of its holiday packages, comprising hotels and resorts, cruises and its TUI Musement tours and activities business.

A 2% rise in occupancy and an increase in average daily rates supported a 66% rise in underlying EBIT in hotels and resorts in the quarter. Average daily rates for cruises, meanwhile, also rose in the reporting period, propelling earnings, TUI said.

TUI Musement posted a 19% rise in revenue in the quarter, the steepest increase across the group. The unit sold 2.3 million packages, a 12% increase. TUI expects bookings at the unit to grow at a high single-digit in the second quarter and at a low double-digit rate for the second half of the year.

TUI carried 3.7 million customers in the quarter, 6% more than in the prior year, driving a revenue increase of 13% to 4.87 billion euros. Package holiday customer numbers rose 18% to 700,000.

Winter and summer bookings were both up 2% on year with average prices 4% higher, the company said. TUI said its summer program was 32% sold with Spain, Greece and Turkey the most popular destinations.

"In particular, the positive booking momentum in recent weeks shows that consumers continue to prioritize their vacation," TUI said.

TUI backed its fiscal 2025 guidance of 5% to 10% revenue growth and underlying EBIT growth of 7% to 10%.

The company said it is well-positioned to deliver on its midterm targets including growing underlying EBIT by a compound annual growth rate of around 7% to 10%.
