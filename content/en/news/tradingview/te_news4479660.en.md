Stocks in Europe traded on Friday, with the STOXX 50 slipping 0.2% and the STOXX 600 down 0.1%, after gains in the previous session pushed the two benchmarks to record levels.

Traders assessed developments in the trade war, as President Trump announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on a country-by-country basis, set to take effect as early as April.

However, investors awaited further details on the levies and remained hopeful that negotiations could prevent their implementation.

Healthcare and insurance were the worst performers while the food and beverages sector booked the biggest gains.

Meanwhile, the earnings season continues with Hermes soaring almost 5% after reporting better-than-expected Q4 sales.

The luxury sector got a boost on the news, with LVMH (1.7%) and Kering (1.5%) also gaining.

Natwest on the other hand, lost more than 1% as its quarterly results failed to impress investors.

Considering the full week, the STOXX 50 soared about 3% and the STOXX 50 added nearly 2%.
