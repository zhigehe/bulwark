Galderma said Friday it secured the European Commission's approval for Nemluvio, or nemolizumab, for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis.

The authorization is based on the results of the late-stage Arcadia and Olympia trials, in which the drug showed significant improvements in itch, skin lesions, and sleep disturbance in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and adults with prurigo nodularis.

The Swiss dermatology company said the monoclonal antibody was well tolerated across all trials, exhibiting a generally consistent safety profile with earlier data and between clinical studies.

Nemluvio was also approved in the US and is under review by regulatory authorities in other countries for the same indications.
