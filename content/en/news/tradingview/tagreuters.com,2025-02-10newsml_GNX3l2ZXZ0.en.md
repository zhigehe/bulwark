*faidr 30-day retention continues to build*

Upgraded subscription conversion optimization platform launched last week

Subscription revenue guidance to be reported end of Q1

BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **Auddia Inc.** (“Auddia” or the “Company”), a technology company that has built a proprietary AI platform for audio identification and classification to reinvent how consumers engage with audio, today announced that 30-day user retention metrics are continuing to build.

Auddia reported acceleration of faidr 30-day retention to over 20% in October and finished the year with each month in Q4 over 20%. January retention continued to build to just below 25% and February is expected to be the first month to surpass 25%.

Last week Auddia completed integration into faidr of an advanced subscription platform in support of executing an advanced subscription conversion and revenue optimization strategy.

“We continue to see positive momentum across all stages of the retention funnel as a result of our ongoing product and marketing optimization improvements,” said Theo Romeo, Auddia’s Chief Marketing and Product Officer. “As these product and marketing optimizations continue to bear fruit, we are now in the early stages of adding subscription conversion optimization strategies to the mix. This began in earnest last week when we completed the integration of an advanced subscription conversion platform into faidr. This platform gives us the ability to dial in the best combination of pricing, messaging, and offerings to optimize subscription conversions and revenue. We expect to see subscription conversion metrics follow a similar positive trajectory to the one we have been demonstrating for 30-day retention.”

The Company reaffirms that at the end of Q1 it expects to provide further guidance on how subscription revenue may build over the year as product, marketing, and subscription conversion optimizations continue to drive results.
