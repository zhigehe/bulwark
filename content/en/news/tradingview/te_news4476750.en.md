Soybean futures dropped below $10.30 per bushel after the latest WASDE report projected higher-than-expected US soybean stocks and weak export demand.

The USDA maintained its forecast for US soybean ending stocks, despite earlier expectations of a reduction, keeping downward pressure on prices.

Global supplies remain abundant, with Brazil’s strong harvest adding to an already oversupplied market.

The report also lowered Argentina’s soybean production outlook due to hot and dry weather, but this adjustment was not enough to ease broader supply concerns.

With no significant cuts to production, soybean prices struggled to find support.

The market remains focused on global production trends and demand uncertainties, both of which continue to weigh on futures.

Without a major shift in supply or demand, soybean prices are likely to remain under pressure in the near term.
