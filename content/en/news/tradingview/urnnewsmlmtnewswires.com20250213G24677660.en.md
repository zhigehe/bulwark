South Korea's exports of information and communications technology goods fell 0.4% to $16.3 billion in January from a year earlier, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Thursday.

Imports of ICT goods stood at $13.5 billion, which led to a trade balance surplus of $2.8 billion in the month, the release said.

Semiconductor exports rose 7.7% year-on-year to $10.1 billion in January, driven by AI demand and a 17.2% increase in memory chips to $6.2 billion. However, outbound shipments of system chips declined 4.3% to $3.5 billion.

Computer and peripheral exports climbed 10% to $0.9 billion, with solid-state drives up 27.1% to $600 million, marking 13 months of growth, according to the news release.
