Europe's real gross domestic product is expected to grow an average of 2.1% in 2025, with Western Europe potentially expanding 1.1%, results from the ifo Institute's economic experts survey showed Monday.

Globally, the economy is estimated to grow 2.9% in 2025, compared with a 2.6% jump in the previous year.

Over the medium and long term, experts forecast growth in Europe of 2.4% in 2026 and 2.7% in 2028, below the global average of the last decade. In Germany, growth is projected at 1% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2028, while countries such as Spain and the Netherlands could witness stagnation or a decline in growth rates over the years.

Worldwide growth in the medium- and long-term is forecast at 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.
