EQT

* With both institutional and individual investors looking to semi-liquid strategies for diversification and customization, EQT broadens portfolio with the introduction of EQT Nexus Infrastructure
* EQT Nexus Infrastructure offers exposure to EQT's infrastructure strategies, direct investments in infrastructure companies in EQT's portfolio, and the same distinctive infrastructure investment approach EQT's institutional clients have benefited from for over fifteen years
* EQT is one of the world's largest infrastructure investors with three dedicated strategies: Value-Add, Active Core, and Transition Infrastructure

EQT has today introduced EQT Nexus Infrastructure (or “the Strategy”), its latest semi-liquid strategy. EQT has been expanding in the evergreen space since the launch of its first semi-liquid strategy for individual and institutional investors in 2023, with this introduction reflecting investors’ growing desire to customize their private markets portfolios.

EQT Nexus Infrastructure provides individual and institutional investors access to a diversified suite of infrastructure investment strategies. With experienced, local teams and a network of more than 600 industrial advisors, EQT’s EUR 75 billion1 global infrastructure business deploys capital through its Value-Add Infrastructure, Active Core Infrastructure, and Transition Infrastructure strategies. The platform identifies and develops high-quality infrastructure businesses that provide essential services to society, thematically sourced within the digital, energy and environmental, transport and logistics, and social infrastructure sectors. Its investments range from transition-related scale-up companies to mature, market-leading infrastructure businesses.

“Expanding our portfolio of semi-liquid strategies is a key focus for our firm. As we go on this journey, two trends are emerging,” **said Peter Beske Nielsen, Partner at EQT**. “For one, individual investors want the flexibility to customize their portfolios, which EQT Nexus Infrastructure does by enabling access to our infrastructure strategies through a single fully-funded investment and a single layer of fees. We also believe that institutional investors increasingly desire these benefits, as part of the diversification of their portfolios.”

The EQT Nexus Infrastructure Advisory team will be led by Advisory Head of Fund Strategy **William Vettorato, who commented**: “We are seeing elevated demand for evergreen infrastructure strategies. EQT Nexus Infrastructure enables individuals and institutions alike to play a role in supporting businesses that offer essential services to society, while benefitting from EQT’s demonstrated approach to investing and relentless focus on performance. We’re excited to unlock this opportunity that addresses the typical barriers to entry, such as high minimum investment period and lengthy lock-ups applicable to close-ended funds.”
