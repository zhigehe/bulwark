The Netherlands’ economy expanded by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2024, following a 0.8% growth in Q3, driven by the trade balance, investments, and consumption, preliminary data showed.

Exports of goods and services rose by 0.4%, led by machinery, natural gas, and electricity, while imports fell by 0.6%, notably due to reduced natural gas imports as stocks were drawn down.

The trade balance surged by over 7%.

Investments in fixed assets grew by 3%, particularly in cars and vans, influenced by upcoming tax changes and new environmental regulations.

Aircraft investments also increased.

Government and household consumption both rose by 0.9%, with higher spending on healthcare and vehicles.

Added value grew in nearly all sectors, with agriculture, forestry, and fisheries leading at 5.8%.

The government sector, especially healthcare and public administration, made the largest contribution to growth, followed by industry, driven by machinery and food production.
