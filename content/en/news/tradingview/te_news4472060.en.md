Soybean futures fell to $10.49 per bushel on Friday, after reaching a six-month high of $10.79-3/4 earlier in the week.

The drop was driven by renewed concerns over potential trade disputes, as President Donald Trump announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries, raising fears of retaliatory measures that could impact US crop exports.

Traders were also watching weather developments in Argentina, the world’s largest exporter of soymeal and soyoil, where improved rainfall helped ease concerns after a period of hot, dry conditions.

The Rosario grains exchange reported that recent showers provided relief to the country’s struggling soy crop, which had been suffering from extreme heat.

Despite these developments, ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade policies continued to weigh on market sentiment.

Additionally, traders awaited the US Department of Agriculture’s upcoming supply and demand report, which could provide further insights into the soybean market.
