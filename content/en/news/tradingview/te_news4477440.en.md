The euro climbed above $1.04, its strongest level in nearly two weeks, driven by optimism over a potential resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.

President Donald Trump announced that the US and Russia would begin immediate negotiations following his conversation with President Putin and that the two leaders would meet in Saudi Arabia for further discussions.

Meanwhile, monetary policy divergence between the ECB and the Fed continues to weigh on the euro, with the Fed maintaining a cautious stance on rate cuts while the ECB is expected to continue easing.

Additionally, Trump's trade policies remain in focus, as the European Union vowed to retaliate against US tariffs on European steel and aluminum.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the tariffs as "unjustified" and pledged firm countermeasures, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that Europe would respond "within an hour" if the measures were implemented.
