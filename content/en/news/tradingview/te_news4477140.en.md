The South Korean won edged lower to around 1,452 per dollar as mounting concerns over escalating trade tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

On Wednesday, the White House announced that President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be unveiled as soon as Thursday, following his earlier decision to impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.

In South Korea, President Trump also hinted the possibility of imposing tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceuticals.

These measures are expected to hurt domestic exporters, as these are key country's outbound products.

In response, Acting President Choi Sang-mok announced that the government would pursue talks with the US to address the tariff issue and protect Korean business interests.

Meanwhile, BoK Governor Rhee Chang-yong stated that the expected rate cut later this month is not guaranteed.

The Bank of Korea unexpectedly kept its key interest rate at 3% during its January 2025 meeting, defying market expectations of 25 bps cut.
