The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.

0719 GMT - Stabilization may lie ahead for bond markets as this week's duration-heavy supply in the eurozone is cleared and the macro calendar thins out, says Commerzbank Research's Hauke Siemssen in a note. However, positive risk sentiment on the latest headlines around Ukraine limits the potential in Bunds, the rates strategist says. U.S. President Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday had agreed to open immediate talks to end the war in Ukraine. Eurozone government bond supply will be modest in the remainder of the week, with only Italy auctioning 4.75 billion-5.75 billion euros in 2027- and 2031-dated bonds on Thursday. The 10-year Bund yield is little changed at 2.475%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0710 GMT - U.S. Treasurys pare some of Wednesday's weakness that was prompted by above-consensus inflation data. The 2- and 10-year Treasury yields fall 3 basis points to 4.338% and 4.606%, respectively, according to Tradeweb. On Wednesday, the 2-year Treasury yield increased 7.5 basis points to 4.365%, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 10 basis points to 4.637%, according to Tradeweb. "With inflation still above target and the Federal Reserve on hold, fundamentals take center stage," says Global X's Scott Helfstein in a note. However, large and small companies see strong sales and earnings growth so far this quarter and higher rates aren't yet much of an impediment, the head of investment strategy says.

0652 GMT - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 1.4% to close at 2583.17, gaining for a third consecutive session. Institutional investors were net buyers. Construction and steel stocks advanced after the U.S. and Russian presidents agreed to begin talks to end the war in Ukraine. Heightened expectations for ending the war drove a rally in reconstruction-related stocks, outweighing jitters over hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation data overnight. Excavator maker HD Hyundai Construction Equipment climbed 9.5%. Steelmaker Posco Holdings rose 6.9%. USD/KRW settled 0.4% lower at 1,447.50 in Seoul onshore trading. South Korea's 10-year government bond yield was up 1.1 bps at 2.890%. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)

0648 GMT - U.S. January CPI data that came above forecasts will do little to calm markets that are obsessed with tariffs, says Federated Hermes' Damian McIntyre in a note. The decline in inflation has clearly been paused, and recent tariff announcements have the potential to increase inflation in the coming months, the portfolio manager says. "Fortunately, the labor market is strong, incomes are growing and the consumer is experiencing real wage growth, all of which should help markets weather a sustained pause in rates." The data prompted a significant selloff in U.S. Treasurys causing the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 10 basis points on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield falls 3 basis points to last trade at 4.607%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0643 GMT - The slow progress in U.S. inflation could mean that the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates until the fall or perhaps not at all this year, says MainSky Asset Management's Eckhard Schulte. "This is not our core scenario, but ultimately it would not establish a new 'market statics'," the chairman of the board says. U.S. inflation data for January came in above expectations, prompting a knee jerk reaction in Treasurys with yields rising. This would only be the case if the Fed were talking about possible interest rate hikes, Schulte says. "But it will not do that as long as the inflation picture does not deteriorate massively over several months." (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0549 GMT - Asean economies' deep trade and investment ties to China could put them at risk of a large indirect impact from U.S. tariffs, ING's Deepali Bhargava says. China is Asean's largest source of imports, and their supply chains seem increasingly intertwined, the head of APAC research says. The range of traded sectors is extensive, including electronics, steel, plastics, and chemicals. Although Southeast Asia benefits from companies diversifying manufacturing, supply chains remain heavily reliant on China, she notes. Increased economic integration with China could hurt Asean short term via China's slowdown and tariff-reduced export demand. That said, the region can benefit significantly from FDI inflows from both China and the U.S. as businesses diversify manufacturing, she adds. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
