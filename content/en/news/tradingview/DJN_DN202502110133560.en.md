Vietnam and India appear the most vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, ANZ Research economists say in a report. Vietnam looks the most exposed to higher across-the-board tariffs and could be a priority target if the U.S. focuses on economies that are among the top contributors to its trade deficit, the economists say. Should the U.S. opt for reciprocal tariffs and seek to equalize average tariffs with each trading partner, India stands out as the most vulnerable, followed by Thailand, they say. As for sectors mentioned as potential targets for product-specific U.S. tariffs, Asia is most vulnerable when it comes to semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and cars, the economists add.
