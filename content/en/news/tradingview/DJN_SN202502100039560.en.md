Fast-food giant's adjusted profit misses analysts' consensus estimate but stock rises as comparable-store sales beat estimate and foot traffic grows at its U.S. stores

McDonald's Corp.'s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings fell short of analysts' consensus estimate, but the stock rose as same-store sales came in stronger than expected and traffic at U.S. stores climbed for the first time in several quarters.

McDonald's stock (MCD) rose 5% as investors latched on to the positive developments in what at least one analyst, Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones, described as a mixed quarter.

"Strength in international markets was mostly offset by continued weakness in the U.S.," said Yarbrough, who reiterated a hold rating on the stock. "While traffic in the U.S. was positive for the first time in several quarters, consumers are spending less at each visit, which drove the entiredecline in sales. The large price increases in the restaurant industry over the past few years is most likely a headwind to lower-income consumers."

McDonald's reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.83 a share, missing the FactSet consensus estimate of $2.85 a share.

On the plus side, total same-store sales rose 0.4%, which was better than the analyst projection for a drop of 1.1%.

Broken out, U.S. comparable-store sales fell 1.4% as customers spent less per check - but this was partly offset by slightly positive comparable-guest counts, the company said. Comparable-store sales in the international developmental licensed markets segment increased 4.1%.

Revenue at the hamburger pioneer remained roughly flat at $6.39 billion but missed the analyst estimate of $6.45 billion.

Including Monday's moves, McDonald's stock is up 6.7% in 2025, while the S&P 500 SPX has risen 3%.
