A decision by Canada's bank regulator to defer a planned increase to the Basel III standardized capital floor suggests the move has been indefinitely shelved, Scotiabank's Derek Holt suggests. The deferral, following last summer's one-year delay, follows a global pattern, the economist adds. It means Canadian banks won't be at a relative disadvantage to banks in other countries, and most notably in the U.S., in having to set aside more capital. Holt says the competitive equity angle clearly dominated the regulator's decision since its release notes there remains uncertainty about when other jurisdictions will fully implement Basel III. "Under Trump? Likely never." (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)
