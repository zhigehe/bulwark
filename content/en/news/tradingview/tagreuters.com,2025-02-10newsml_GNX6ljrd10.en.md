Yokneam Illit, Israel, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Wearable Devices Ltd. (the “Company” or “Wearable Devices”) (Nasdaq: WLDS, WLDSW), an award-winning pioneer in artificial intelligence (“AI”)-based wearable gesture control technology, is developing cutting-edge methods for gesture personalization that will transform user interactions in the near future. By harnessing biopotential signals from the human wrist, Wearable Devices is working towards redefining how people interact with digital devices, creating an intuitive, personalized experience for the AI era.

**The Future of Personalized AI-Driven Gestures**

As AI continues to shape our digital landscape, the way we interact with technology is evolving. Traditional input methods - keyboards, touchscreens, and voice commands - are expected to give way to more natural, seamless interactions. Wearable Devices is developing an AI-powered neural wristband technology for detection of user specific micro-gestures, enabling a future of personalized controls tailored to individual users.

Leveraging Large MUAP Models (“LMMs”), Wearable Devices is enhancing its ability to create truly personalized gesture experiences that improve and adapt more effectively with continued use.

**A New Era for AI-Powered Devices and XR Platforms**

Wearable Devices’ neural-based gesture personalization is being developed to revolutionize extended reality (XR), smartwatches, and other AI-driven interfaces. The technology aims to enable:

* Micro-Gesture Precision: AI refining recognition of tiny movements, such as a finger swipes or pinches, ensuring reliable, real-time responsiveness.
* Context-Aware Interactions: A system that is adaptive to user habits.
* Cross-Device Integration: Personalized gestures seamlessly operating across augmented reality (“AR”)/virtual reality headsets, AR glasses, smartwatches, and other AI-powered devices, creating a unified interaction experience.

Wearable Devices is focused on taking it a step further by developing adaptive, user-specific models rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. This approach is expected to enhance accessibility, usability, and engagement in AI-driven environments.

**A Call to AI and XR Innovators**

As AI-powered devices become more ubiquitous, Wearable Devices is actively developing next-generation intuitive and personalized user interactions. With over a decade of research and development and a growing portfolio of patents, the Company invites industry leaders to explore collaboration opportunities.

“We believe AI-driven gesture personalization is the next frontier in human-device interaction,” said Asher Dahan, Chief Executive Officer of Wearable Devices. “By seamlessly integrating AI with biopotential sensing, we are developing innovations that will revolutionize the way people engage with technology.”
