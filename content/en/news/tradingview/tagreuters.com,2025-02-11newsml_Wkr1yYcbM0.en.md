Swedish Logistic Property

Several of SLP's previous sustainability targets, set for the end of 2025, were already achieved in 2024. This has been made possible through focused and strategic work where sustainability is an integrated part of the business model and creates value for multiple stakeholders. As part of the continued work, the company's sustainability policy and sustainability targets have been revised and new ambitious targets have been adopted from 2025.

The new sustainability targets are:

* Achieve net-zero emissions in scope 3 by 2040.
* Reduce the lettable area from properties with energy class F and G - maximum 5 percent by the end of 2027.

Previous sustainability targets with revised target figures set for the end of 2027:

* 70 percent of the lettable area shall be environmentally certified according to BREEAM In-Use level Very Good or equivalent.
* 85 percent sustainable loans (excluding sustainability-linked financing).
* The installed effect in solar cell systems shall be at least 25 MWp.

Previously communicated sustainability targets remain unchanged.

"It is very pleasing that we have already achieved many of our sustainability goals ahead of schedule. We are also well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of climate-neutral management by 2030. We are now setting an even longer-term ambition, including the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in our entire value chain by 2040," says Tommy Åstrand, CEO of SLP.
