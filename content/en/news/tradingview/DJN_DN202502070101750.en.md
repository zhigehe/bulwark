Canada's obsession with housing poses a stiff headwind on efforts to improve the country's poor record on productivity, as consumers and investors have tended in the past decade to park their savings in real estate. "We need to change the incentives around home buying/selling in order to push people toward more productive endeavors," writes economist Benjamin Reitzes at BMO Capital Markets. A period of stagnant home prices, which Canada is presently witnesses, might prompt that shift in investment decisions, Reitzes said. He warns, however, this might be short lived should interest rates fall sharply from present levels and policymakers lift the brakes on immigration-fueled population growth.
