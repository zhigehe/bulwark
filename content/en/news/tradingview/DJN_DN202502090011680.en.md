Domino's Pizza Enterprises' bulls at Goldman Sachs want to see evidence of improved same-store sales growth at the Australian fast-food franchiser. GS analysts are encouraged by how swiftly the new CEO has pivoted to refocus on unit economics, but tell clients in a note that this is just a first step. They think it is now critical for the company to provide investors with comfort that same-store sales growth has passed an inflection point, especially in the more challenging Japan and France markets. GS lowers its sales forecasts through fiscal 2027 and cuts its target price 4.7% to A$38.30. Shares are down 0.9% at A$35.60. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
