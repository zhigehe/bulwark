Australia's Suncorp Group reported a 30.3% rise in its first-half cash earnings on Wednesday, beating the consensus estimate and citing a robust capital position with the capacity for likely on-market buybacks.

The insurer, which earned a net A$4.1 billion from the sale of its banking arm to ANZ Group, also declared a special dividend of 22 Australian (AU) cents per share.

The company declared an interim dividend of 41 AU cents per share, compared with 34 cents declared last year.

Meanwhile, Suncorp's total cost of natural hazard events was A$503 million, A$277 million below its allowance for the first half due to relatively benign weather conditions.

The insurer said the cash earnings were A$860 million ($541.37 million) for the six months ended December 31, compared with A$660 million posted a year earlier and the Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$775.1 million.
