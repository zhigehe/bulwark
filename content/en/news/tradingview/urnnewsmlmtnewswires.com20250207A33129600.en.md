AbbVie said Friday it received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its antibiotic Emblaveo for the treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections.

The approval covers Emblaveo's use with metronidazole in patients who have limited or no alternative options to treat their infections, including those caused by Gram-negative bacteria which can become antimicrobial resistant, the drugmaker said.

Emblaveo will be available for commercial use in Q3, AbbVie said.
