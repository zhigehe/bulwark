European stocks closed firmly higher to extend their strong momentum on Tuesday as strong corporate results backed the ongoing view that European stocks have favorable valuations compared to North American counterparts, while markets assessed the impact that new tariffs by the US can impact European corporate giants.

The Eurozone’s STOXX 50 advanced 0.6% to close at 5,392, the highest since 2,000, and the STOXX 600 jumped 0.3% to a record high of 547.

SAP and ASML advanced 2.3% and 0.8%, respectively, to set the pace for tech stocks.

On the heavyweight discretionary sector, Ferrari jumped 2.8% to extend its post-earnings momentum, and Kering advanced 1.3%.

On the other hand, UniCredit underperformed a strong session for banks with a 1% drop after posting their results.

Outside the Eurozone, ferrous and base metal miners in London including Rio Tinto, Anglo American, and Glencore lost up to 3% after US President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on aluminum and steel.
