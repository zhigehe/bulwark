NASA's acting administrator Janet Petro on Wednesday said Elon Musk's government efficiency panel plans to examine the space agency's spending and that any concerns about conflicts of interest would be reviewed by NASA's legal team.

"We are going to have DOGE come. They're going to look - similarly what they've done in other agencies - at our payments and what money has gone out," Petro, who was previously the head of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, told reporters at a conference in Washington.
