\*\* Shares in Genmab rise 4.6% after the Danish drugmaker reported its Q4 operating income and guidance above expectations

\*\* J.P.Morgan highlights EBIT and EBIT guidance beats as "small positives", the beats coming as a result of lower R&D spending

\*\* JPM also points to Q4 revenues 1% ahead of company consensus which was driven by a higher-than-expected cancer drug Darzalex royalty rate of 19%

\*\* Van Lanschot Kempen adds that the continued Darzalex sales growth can provide a "robust" royalty stream for the coming years

\*\* Both JPM and Kempen note that the HexaBody-CD38 programme weighs on the stock price and see Johnson & Johnson's decision in Q1Â 2025 as potentially unburdening the shares

\*\* The shares are on track for their best day in 2 months, if the gains hold
