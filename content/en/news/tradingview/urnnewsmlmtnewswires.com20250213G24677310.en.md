Avita Medical reported Friday a loss of $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a loss of $0.28 per diluted share in the same period in 2023.

Analysts polled by Visible Alpha also expected a loss of $0.44.

The dual-listed firm said the wider net loss was due to higher operating expenses and lower other income, net, partially offset by higher gross profit.

Total revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, came in at $18.4 million, compared with $14.2 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected $20.3 million.

The company said it expects its full-year 2025 commercial revenue to be in the range of $100 to $106 million, reflecting growth of approximately 55% to 65% over the full-year 2024.

The company's shares surged past 12% in recent Friday trade in Australia.
