A decade ago, France’s capital saw the world unite to fight climate change. In 2025, the US has refused to sign even a vague pledge for ‘inclusive and sustainable AI’ at President Macron’s conflab. Washington is entitled to do as it likes, but the lack of consensus is striking.

CONTEXT NEWS

U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on February 11 that their “massive” regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as “authoritarian censorship”.

The United States and Britain did not sign up to the final statement of a French-hosted AI summit that said AI should be inclusive, open, ethical and safe. The two countries did not immediately explain why they had not signed the AI summit’s declaration, as shown by a published text, while at least 60 countries including China had done so.

Setting out the Trump administration’s America First agenda, Vance said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union’s far tougher regulatory approach.

“We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,” Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris. “We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship.”

Vance criticised the “massive regulations” created by the EU’s Digital Services Act, as well as Europe’s online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms.
