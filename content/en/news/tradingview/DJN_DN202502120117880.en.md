Treasury yields hold on to their gains as markets brace for a long period of unchanged interest rates. January CPI was higher than expected, although seasonal factors might have been at play. Markets are now pricing 30% odds that there will be no rate cuts this year, up from 20% yesterday, according to CME. Odds of only one cut are 40%. On Thursday, weekly jobless claims are expected to decline to 215,000 from 219,000, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. PPI inflation is forecast to accelerate. The 10-year yield gains a tenth of a percentage point, to 4.636%, its largest one-day rise since December. The two-year gains 0.075 p.p., to 4.365%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
