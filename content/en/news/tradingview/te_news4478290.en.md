The euro pared some gains to trade around $1.04 as investors closely watched ongoing negotiations over a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump vowed to bring the conflict to a swift end after holding separate discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Meanwhile, monetary policy divergence between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve continued to pressure the euro.

The Fed maintained a cautious stance on rate cuts following hotter-than-expected US inflation data, while the ECB is expected to proceed with monetary easing.

Additionally, Trump's trade policies remained in focus, with tensions escalating after the European Union vowed to retaliate against US tariffs on European steel and aluminum.
