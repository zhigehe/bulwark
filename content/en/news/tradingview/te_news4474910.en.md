The Canadian dollar stabilized around 1.43 per USD, holding its rebound from 22-year lows of 1.455 seen on January 31st, buoyed by a strong labor market that has reduced the urgency for the Bank of Canada to cut rates, with unemployment falling to 6.6% in January and easing concerns about labor market weakness flagged by the BoC. Although worries persist over U.S. President Trump’s new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which aim to support American industries but risk escalating trade tensions, the currency’s recovery has been bolstered by a temporary pause on 25% tariffs affecting Canada’s exports, secured by Prime Minister Trudeau to allow further negotiations.

Additionally, a rebound in crude oil prices amid supply concerns has lifted demand for the commodity-linked loonie.

Meanwhile, despite a sharp drop in the Ivey PMI signaling potential near-term economic risks, investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic that Canada will ultimately avoid the brunt of new trade levies.
