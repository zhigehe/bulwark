\*\* Ahead of Munich Security Conference starting on Friday, Jefferies lays out its view on how to play a potential Ukraine-Russia ceasefire

\*\* "Whilst the finer details of what a settlement looks like remain unknown, (...) any tangible newsflow suggesting a resolution will be quickly priced in by markets," it says in a Tuesday note

\*\* It sees any initial negative reaction for aerospace and defence names as a buying opportunity as Europe bulks up on its defence; points to Babcock , BAE Systems , Thales , Avon , Chemring and Qinetiq as longer-term beneficiaries

\*\* In building and construction space, it views companies with Eastern European footprints as key beneficiaries, including CRH , Heidelberg , Holcim , Kingspan , Saint-Gobain , Sika and Ferrovial

\*\* It adds construction market suppliers are also likely to see outsized benefits and those to monitor include Siemens , Schneider Electric , Prysmian , Siemens Energy , Vestas , Daimler and Volvo

\*\* "Any improvement in European growth prospects will also be positive for economic growth (and commodities), whilst companies with residual operations in Ukraine/Russia should also benefit" - Jefferies

\*\* Thus, in the resources space, it says stocks to watch are ArcelorMittal , Total , BP , Saipem , Subsea 7 , TechnipFMC , BASF , Stora Enso , Billerud , Victrex , Elementis , Synthomer and Bodycote

\*\* Among airlines it notes that Wizz Air has the greatest fleet capacity to and from the region, while in airports, ADP and Fraport will also likely benefit as key transport hubs

\*\* Since Ukraine/Russia produce critical materials for semiconductors, better access would alleviate supply chain concerns, Jefferies notes, adding that ASML , Infineon and STMicroelectronics are likely beneficiaries
