Ganfeng Lithium commenced lithium production at its plant in northern Argentina, Reuters reported Wednesday.

The Mariana project is among Ganfeng's several projects in Argentina, according to Reuters.

Ganfeng invested $790 million in the project, which has a capacity of 20,000 metric tons of lithium chloride per year from extraction at the Llullaillaco salt flat, the report said.

The lithium giant also invested $190 million in a solar park to power the facility, according to the report.
