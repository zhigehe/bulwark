0652 GMT - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 1.4% to close at 2583.17, gaining for a third consecutive session. Institutional investors were net buyers. Construction and steel stocks advanced after the U.S. and Russian presidents agreed to begin talks to end the war in Ukraine. Heightened expectations for ending the war drove a rally in reconstruction-related stocks, outweighing jitters over hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation data overnight. Excavator maker HD Hyundai Construction Equipment climbed 9.5%. Steelmaker Posco Holdings rose 6.9%. USD/KRW settled 0.4% lower at 1,447.50 in Seoul onshore trading. South Korea's 10-year government bond yield was up 1.1 bps at 2.890%. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)

0648 GMT - U.S. January CPI data that came above forecasts will do little to calm markets that are obsessed with tariffs, says Federated Hermes' Damian McIntyre in a note. The decline in inflation has clearly been paused, and recent tariff announcements have the potential to increase inflation in the coming months, the portfolio manager says. "Fortunately, the labor market is strong, incomes are growing and the consumer is experiencing real wage growth, all of which should help markets weather a sustained pause in rates." The data prompted a significant selloff in U.S. Treasurys causing the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 10 basis points on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield falls 3 basis points to last trade at 4.607%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0643 GMT - The slow progress in U.S. inflation could mean that the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates until the fall or perhaps not at all this year, says MainSky Asset Management's Eckhard Schulte. "This is not our core scenario, but ultimately it would not establish a new 'market statics'," the chairman of the board says. U.S. inflation data for January came in above expectations, prompting a knee jerk reaction in Treasurys with yields rising. This would only be the case if the Fed were talking about possible interest rate hikes, Schulte says. "But it will not do that as long as the inflation picture does not deteriorate massively over several months." (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0549 GMT - Asean economies' deep trade and investment ties to China could put them at risk of a large indirect impact from U.S. tariffs, ING's Deepali Bhargava says. China is Asean's largest source of imports, and their supply chains seem increasingly intertwined, the head of APAC research says. The range of traded sectors is extensive, including electronics, steel, plastics, and chemicals. Although Southeast Asia benefits from companies diversifying manufacturing, supply chains remain heavily reliant on China, she notes. Increased economic integration with China could hurt Asean short term via China's slowdown and tariff-reduced export demand. That said, the region can benefit significantly from FDI inflows from both China and the U.S. as businesses diversify manufacturing, she adds. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)

0417 GMT - The Reserve Bank of India will likely cut rates by 25 bps again in April, Rahul Bajoria of BofAS India writes in a note. Easing food inflation and softer domestic economic growth gives the RBI space to cut rates further, though it remains dependent on the global economic developments, says the economist. The monetary policy has pivoted firmly to support growth, as medium-term inflation forecasts for RBI are broadly aligned with its 4% target, and core CPI remains benign, Bajoria says. He expects a total of 75 bps additional rate cuts through 2025 to bring the repo rate to 5.50% by year-end. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)

0412 GMT - Australian consumers are being watched closely amid concerns that a possible recovery in spending could derail an interest-rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. Still, the monthly CommBank Household Spending Insights Index was flat in January as consumers took a breather from opening their wallets following sale activity in the final months of 2024. The January result was somewhat expected following a spike in spending in the last three months of 2024 off the back heavy price discounting, says CBA senior economist Belinda Allen. CBA is forecasting a cut in the RBA's official cash rate next week, she adds. The HSI index tracks on-month payments data by approximately 7 million CBA customers, comprising roughly 30% of all Australian consumer transactions. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0346 GMT - The Singapore dollar strengthens against its U.S. counterpart in the Asian session, as risk appetite recovers alongside mild gains in U.S. stock-index futures. Sentiment is also likely supported by an agreement between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin to start talks to end the war in Ukraine. Risk sentiment has been boosted by hopes for peace in the region says OCBC's Global Markets Research team in a research report, noting that Trump said both Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky, in separate phone calls with him, each expressed willingness to negotiate. USD/SGD is 0.2% lower at 1.3504. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

0315 GMT - A February rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia is the most probable outcome but remains far from certain, says Carl Ang, a research analyst at MFS Investment Management. Market expectations around a February cut firmed after quarterly inflation came inside the RBA's target band, Ang says in a note. However, the current tightening labor market and fiscal expansion set a fundamentally different backdrop than the low-rate environment prepandemic and could lead RBA easing to progress more slowly than anticipated, Ang says. The U.S. tariff outlook and its implications for Asia-Pacific economies, especially on China, are also key uncertainties. Ang's base case remains for cash rate cuts every quarter in 2025.

0307 GMT - Expectations for New Zealand inflation over the coming year have picked up slightly, rising to 2.15% from 2.05% previously, which follows a sharp fall in the New Zealand dollar in recent weeks that is set to push imported inflation higher for a period over the coming year, says Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at Westpac. Of more concern for the RBNZ are expectations over longer horizons, with the closely watched measure of expected inflation in two years' time edging down to 2.06% from 2.12% in the prior quarter, he adds. The survey will leave the RBNZ feeling comfortable that pricing behavior is well aligned with its medium-term inflation target, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0213 GMT - The Trump administration's tariffs could weaken the Korean won against the U.S. dollar in the near term, with USD/KRW likely to stay at around 1,470.00 on a three-month horizon, Citigroup analysts Jin-Wook Kim and Jiuk Choi write in a note. The pair is flat at 1,453.45 early Thursday in Seoul onshore trading. The Citi analysts expect the won to be pressured by escalating risk-off sentiment, weakening export growth and rising USD demand for Korean companies to build supply chains in the U.S. Citi expects the Bank of Korea to cut the policy rate in February unless the pair surges above the 1,500.00 level.

0129 GMT - A Federal Reserve rate cut in March no longer looks likely to Nomura analysts, who now see a hold through 2025. While U.S. economic activity should stay robust near term, it'll likely slow on the impact of the Trump administration's combative trade policy, David Seif and others write. They now expect 10% tariffs on many countries and an increase on those against China. Tariffs will weigh on U.S. consumer spending, while policy uncertainty poses a headwind for business investment, they say. Less aggressive Fed easing due to tariff-fueled inflation could curb the housing market recovery. They think Fed easing may resume in 2Q 2026 once tariff-induced inflation passes. Risks to their view include more a moderate trade policy or the Fed looking past tariff-driven inflation. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)

0057 GMT - The Bank of Thailand is likely to tread cautiously with rate cuts as uncertainty around Trump's policies stays high, Nomura analysts say. They think BOT will pause in February before resuming cutting in April and August once there is more clarity on the impact of trade frictions. That said, the central bank has flagged downside risks to its growth forecasts, citing limited impact from fiscal handouts, which Nomura's Charnon Boonnuch and Euben Paracuelles think raises the risk of an earlier cut. They maintain below-consensus GDP growth forecasts of 2.5% in 2024 and 2.6% in 2025, flagging weaker global growth and trade protectionism as key downside risks. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
