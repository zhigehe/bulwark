As of December 28, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $13,101,000 and total outstanding debt of $4,702,000.

Other Matters

Loss on the Closure of El Rio Grande

In October 2024, the Company advised the landlord of El Rio Grande we would be terminating the lease and closing the property permanently. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of $876,000 during the year ended September 28, 2024 The property closed on January 3, 2025 and during the 13-weeks ended December 28, 2024, the Company incurred additional losses of $146,000.

Gain on the Closure of the Tampa Food Court

On November 26, 2024, the Company agreed to terminate its lease for the food court at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa, FL and, accordingly, vacated the premises on December 15, 2024. In connection with this, Ark Hollywood/Tampa Investment LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, (in which we own a 65% interest) received a termination payment in the amount of $5,500,000, all obligations under the lease ceased and we recorded a gain, net of expenses in the amount of $5,235,000 during the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2024. It is expected that Ark Hollywood/Tampa Investment LLC will distribute approximately 35% of the net proceeds, after expenses, to the other equity holders of Ark Hollywood/Tampa Investment LLC during the second fiscal quarter of 2025.

Bryant Park Grill & Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park Leases

The Company's agreements with the Bryant Park Corporation (the "Landlord"), (a private non-profit entity that manages Bryant Park under agreements with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation) for the Bryant Park Grill & Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park expire on April 30, 2025. During July 2023 (for the Bryant Park Grill & Cafe) and September 2023 (for The Porch at Bryant Park), the Company received requests for proposals (the "RFPs") from the Landlord to which we responded on October 26, 2023. The agreements offered under the RFPs for both locations are for new 10-year agreements, with one five-year renewal option. On January 27, 2025, at a public local community board meeting, the Landlord stated that it had selected a new operator for both locations, although no agreements have been signed. Any such agreements must be approved by both the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and the New York Public Library. Management continues to work with its outside advisors who have been assisting with our efforts to obtain the extensions by ensuring the RFP awards process was both fair and transparent. We intend to pursue all available options to protect the Company's interests.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Except for historical information, this news release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements involve unknown risks, and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein. Important factors that might cause such differences are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, if new information becomes available in the future.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

This news release includes non-generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") performance measures. Although Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance as well as providing useful information to the investor because of its historical use by the Company as both a performance measure and measure of liquidity, and the use of EBITDA by virtually all companies in the restaurant sector as a measure of both performance and liquidity. However, investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP as it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measure employed by other companies.
