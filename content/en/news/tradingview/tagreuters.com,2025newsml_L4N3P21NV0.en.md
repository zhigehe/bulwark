Commonwealth Bank of Australia reported a nearly 2% rise in first-half cash earnings on Wednesday, helped by robust volume growth across its home lending and deposit products portfolio as well as a lower loan impairment expense.

The country's biggest lender said its cash net profit after tax was A$5.13 billion ($3.23 billion) for the six months ended December 31, compared with A$5.02 billion a year earlier. That compares to a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$5.06 billion.
