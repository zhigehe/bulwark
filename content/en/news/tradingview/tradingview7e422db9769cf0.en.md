Insperity, Inc., a leading provider of human resources and business performance solutions, has released its 2024 Form 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the competitive HR services industry.

**Financial Highlights**

**Revenues:** $6,581 million, an increase of 1% from 2023 primarily due to a 3% increase in revenues per WSEE per month, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average WSEEs paid.

**Gross Profit:** $1,052 million, increased by 1% due to a 3% increase in gross profit per WSEE, partially offset by a 2% decline in the average number of WSEEs paid.

**Operating Income:** $117 million, a decrease of 47% from 2023, primarily due to a 14% increase in operating expenses.

**Net Income:** $91 million, decreased by 47% from 2023, impacted by increased operating expenses and a decrease in average WSEEs paid.

**Diluted EPS:** $2.42, a decrease of 46% from 2023, reflecting the decline in net income.

**Business Highlights**

**PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions:** The company offers comprehensive HR services through its Workforce Optimization® and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions, which include payroll, employment administration, employee benefits, and more. Workforce Optimization is the primary offering, while Workforce Synchronization is a lower-cost option for middle market clients.

**Geographical Performance:** The company operates in 48 markets across the United States with 83 physical office locations and four regional service centers. The Southwest region, including Texas, is a significant market for the company.

**Sales Units:** The company serviced an average of 309,093 worksite employees (WSEEs) per month in the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 2% decrease from the previous year.

**Middle Market Focus:** Approximately 26% of the company's average paid WSEEs were in the middle market sector, defined as companies with 150 to 5,000 WSEEs, consistent with the previous year.

**Client Retention:** The company reported a client retention rate of approximately 81% in 2024, slightly down from 83% in 2023, with an average annual retention rate of 84% over the last five years.

**New Product Launches:** The company offers a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital management solution called Workforce AccelerationTM, which is available for clients not choosing the PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions.

**Operational Strategy:** The company employs a 'high-touch/high-tech' approach to service delivery, utilizing personal attention and expertise in advisory areas and leveraging information technology capabilities through its Insperity Premier platform.

**Future Outlook:** The company aims to continue providing specialized HR services to small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S., leveraging its buying power and expertise to offer additional valuable services to clients.

**Strategic Initiatives**

**Strategic Partnership:** The company has entered into a strategic partnership with Workday, which has led to increased operating expenses due to implementation costs. This partnership is part of a broader strategy to enhance their human capital management solutions.

**Expansion Focus:** The company is focusing on expanding its PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions to small and medium-sized businesses across the United States, leveraging its expertise and buying power to provide comprehensive HR services.

**Capital Management:** In 2024, the company paid $89 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 697,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $63 million. The company has a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $650 million, which is used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with $370 million in outstanding letters of credit and borrowings under the facility.

**Future Outlook:** The company plans to rely on cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and availability under its credit facility to meet liquidity requirements for 2025. It also intends to explore public or private debt or equity financing for longer-term capital needs. The company aims to continue its strategic initiatives, including the expansion of its HR solutions and maintaining a disciplined approach to client selection and cost management.

**Challenges and Risks**

**Competitive Industry:** The company operates in a highly competitive HR services industry, facing competition from both traditional PEOs and emerging technology-based HR solutions. This competition may require substantial investments in technology and service enhancements to maintain market position.

**Economic Risks:** Adverse economic conditions, such as tight labor markets and economic slowdowns, could negatively impact demand for outsourced HR services. The company's growth is partially dependent on hiring by existing clients, which may be affected by these conditions.

**COVID-19 Relief Programs:** The company faces risks related to compliance with COVID-19 relief programs, including potential liabilities if claims are denied or if clients are deemed ineligible for Employee Retention Tax Credits.

**Financial Institution Risks:** The company relies on a U.S.-based global systemically important bank for PEO operations. Bank failures or liquidity issues could disrupt access to cash balances and impact liquidity.

**Labor Market Risks:** Labor shortages and increased competition for skilled workers could affect the company's ability to attract and retain talent, impacting service delivery and growth plans.

**Inflation:** Rising inflation could increase operating costs, and the company may not be able to fully offset these costs through price increases, affecting profit margins.

**Geographic Concentration:** The company's operations are concentrated in New York, California, and Texas, making it vulnerable to regional economic factors.

**Regulatory Risks:** Changes in federal, state, and local regulations could impact the company's operations, particularly in relation to employment taxes and health insurance plans.

**Cybersecurity:** The company is exposed to risks from data theft, cyberattacks, and other security vulnerabilities, which could result in financial losses and reputational damage.

**Management Strategies:** Management is focused on addressing labor market challenges by enhancing recruitment and retention strategies. The company is also investing in technology to improve service offerings and maintain compliance with evolving regulations.

**Market Risks:** The company is exposed to market risks, including interest rate fluctuations and changes in economic conditions, which could impact financial performance. Management is monitoring these risks and considering strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects.
