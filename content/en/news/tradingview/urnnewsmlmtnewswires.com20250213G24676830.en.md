Imugene reported two more complete responses in its phase 1b trial of azer-cel cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

Four out of seven patients in the group have achieved a complete response following treatment with azer-cel, chemotherapy, as well as a low dose of interleukin 2, a protein that affects what happens between cells in the immune system, the filing added.

Azer-cel is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which targets CD19 to treat blood cancers.

Imugene said that it remains focused on continuing enrollment in the group, as well as evaluating the long-term durability of responses.

The firm's shares rose 8% in recent trading on Friday.
