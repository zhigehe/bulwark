Qt Group Plc, Stock exchange release, February 13, 2025, at 8:10AM EET

The Board of Directors of Qt Group Plc has decided on a new share-based incentive plan for the company’s key employees. The purpose of the incentive plan is to align the goals of the shareholders and the company's management to develop the company's value, and to commit the company's management and key personnel to the company and achieving the company's strategic goals by offering them a competitive long-term incentive plan. Members of the company's Board of Directors are not included in the incentive plan.

The new performance-based incentive plan covers the years 2025-2027. The applicable performance criteria are based on the company's revenue growth during the measurement period ending at the end of 2027, as well as annually set strategic targets, each with a one-year measurement period.

The reward tied to the revenue growth performance criteria begins to accrue when the revenue for 2027 exceeds 333 million euros and grows linearly to the maximum level, which is achieved with a revenue of 394 million euros. In assessing the achievement of the performance criteria, any acquisitions made during the measurement period (2025-2027) are included in the revenue to the extent that the purchase price is paid otherwise than by directing a share issue of new company shares to the sellers.

The strategic measure set for 2025 is the growth of new customer acquisition.

The possible reward payable based on the share incentive plan corresponds to a a total maximum of 214,000 Qt Group Plc shares. Of the reward, 70 percent is tied to revenue growth in 2025-2027 and 10 percent to the annual strategic indicator in each of the years 2025-2027 respectively. The CEO's share of the payable reward is a maximum amount corresponding to the value of up to 11,000 shares, and the share of other key personnel is a maximum amount corresponding to the value of up to 203,000 shares.

Despite the possible fulfillment of the respective performance criterion, no reward will be paid for any performance criteria if the company's operating profit percentage (EBITA%) during the measurement period of the respective performance criteria is less than 25 percent.

The rewards under the plan will be paid in the spring of 2028 after the confirmation of the financial statements. The rewards will be paid as a combination of Qt Group Plc shares and a cash payment corresponding to the taxes and similar fees arising from the receipt of the shares. The shares paid as a reward will not be subject to any transfer or other restrictions.

The company's Board of Directors has decided to outsource the administration, hedging, and implementation of the incentive plan to Allshares Oy. The Board estimates that no new shares will be issued as a reward under the share incentive plan, and thus the incentive plan will not have a dilutive effect on the company's registered number of shares.
