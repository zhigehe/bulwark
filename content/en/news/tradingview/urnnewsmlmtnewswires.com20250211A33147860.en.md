Black Mammoth Metals Tuesday announced that it is commencing a drill program to test the Rast and Cottonwood targets at the company's Callaghan gold district, Lander County, Nevada.

In a statement it said the required permit and bond are in place with the Bureau of Land Management and 1500 meters of core and reverse circulation drilling is expected to test both targets.

Callaghan is located along the 120-kilometre Austin-Tonopah trend of gold occurrences, deposits and mines that include Quito, Round Mountain, and Northumberland, and is considered prospective for Carlin-type gold mineralization

At the Rast area, drilling has "demonstrated the presence of anomalous gold in decalcified Lower Plate carbonate host rocks".

At the Cottonwood Canyon area, historic drilling has focused on near-surface, open-pit type gold mineralization hosted in Upper Plate rocks. The company said the Cottonwood gold mineralization may represent "a leakage anomaly above a more significant target area located in favourable Lower Plate rocks at depth and is at the intersection of a NW mineralized fault, a NE fault with jasperoid, and the Roberts Mountains Thrust".

In a further update, the company said reverse circulation stratigraphic drilling of approximately 2000 meters is complete at Happy Cat. The results will be announced after it interprets all new data.

The company added it also continues to acquire non-core exploration interests in the western US, by purchase and by staking.

BMM was up $0.01 at $1.16.
