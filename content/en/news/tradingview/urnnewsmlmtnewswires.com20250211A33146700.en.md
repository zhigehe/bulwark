The Bank of Canada Tuesday said the Board of Directors appointment Michelle Alexopoulos as an external deputy governor for a term of two years, effective March 17.

Alexopoulos' appointment is the result of a public external recruitment process and will bring the size of the BoC's Governing Council to seven members on an ongoing basis, noted Canada's central bank in a statement.

The BoC's Governing Council is its policy-making body, responsible for conducting monetary policy and promoting a safe and efficient financial system. Alongside other members of the Council, Alexopoulos will also be responsible for communicating with Canadians about the BoC's policy decisions and its outlook for the economy and inflation.

Alexopoulos will work with the BoC in a part-time capacity and will maintain her affiliation with the University of Toronto, where she is a professor of economics.
