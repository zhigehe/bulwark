Insurance Australia Group posted a 54.2% rise in first-half cash earnings on Thursday, benefiting from higher margins and lower natural perils costs.

The company's natural perils costs were A$215 million ($135.15 million) below its allowance for the half.

That, coupled with a stronger gross written premium growth of 6% and an insurance margin of 19%, sent IAG's cash earnings to A$640 million for the six months ended December 31, from A$415 million last year.

This compares to a Visible Alpha consensus of A$605.3 million.

Its net profit after tax came in at A$778 million for the six months, a increase of 91% from the previous year.

The general insurer announced an interim dividend of 12 Australian cents per share, higher than the 10 Australian cents declared a year ago.

($1 = 1.5908 Australian dollars)
