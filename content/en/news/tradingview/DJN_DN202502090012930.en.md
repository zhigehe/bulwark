President Trump's motorcade departed Caesars Superdome stadium shortly before 9 p.m., heading to the airport, as the Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Super Bowl. Trump, who had predicted a win by the Kansas City chiefs, was expected to return to the White House late Sunday night.

He spent much of the first half of the game seated in the front row of his box next to his daughter Ivanka Trump. Visitors occasionally chatted with him and took photos.
