Centrus Energy shares were up 31% on Friday to $106.92 after the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.

The company, which provides nuclear fuel components and services for the nuclear power industry, on Thursday said it had quarterly earnings of $53.7 million, or $3.20 a share, compared with $56.3 million, or $3.58 a share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of $20.7 million, or $1.25 a share.

Revenue for the quarter was $151.6 million, compared with last year's $103.6 million and the $106.7 million analysts were expecting.

The company's backlog is $3.7 billion as of Dec. 31, and extends to 2040.

Centrus said that during the quarter, it secured new government contracts, made contingent sales of $2 billion in contracts and commitments, and obtained private financing that will help underpin a potential expansion of its enrichment plant in Ohio.
