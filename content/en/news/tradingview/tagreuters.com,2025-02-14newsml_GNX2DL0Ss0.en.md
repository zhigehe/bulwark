SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Yerbaé Brands Corp. (TSX-V: YERB.U; OTCQX: YERBF) (“Yerbaé” or the “Company”), a plant-based functional beverage company, today announced a new partnership with Savannah Distributing Company Inc. (“Savannah Distributing”) to distribute its 12oz functional beverage product line across 172 Kroger locations throughout the State of Georgia.

As part of this strategic agreement, Savannah Distributing, a family-owned and locally operated premium beverage distributor with over 85 years of service to Georgia retailers, will handle the distribution of Yerbaé’s popular functional drinks to Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the United States.

“Partnering with Savannah Distributing marks a significant milestone in our journey to expand Yerbaé’s availability throughout Georgia,” said Todd Gibson, CEO & Co-Founder at Yerbaé. “Kroger is a crucial retail partner for us, and with Savannah’s deep-rooted local expertise and extensive network, we are confident that our refreshing beverages will reach a wider audience of health-conscious consumers in Atlanta and beyond, providing them with delicious, plant-powered options to fuel their active lifestyles.”

This collaboration is poised to elevate Yerbaé’s presence in Georgia and solidify its position as a leading brand in the functional beverage category, all while offering Kroger customers a wider array of healthier and more invigorating drink choices.

Expanding Product Availability and Empowering Consumers

Savannah Distributing will be delivering Yerbaé’s latest 12oz functional beverage lineup, featuring the exciting flavors of Mango Passionfruit, Black Cherry Pineapple, and Peachy Mimosa Twist. This expansion provides Kroger customers with an even wider selection of zero sugar, zero calorie, non-GMO, and gluten-free beverages, empowering them to make healthy choices without sacrificing taste or enjoyment.
