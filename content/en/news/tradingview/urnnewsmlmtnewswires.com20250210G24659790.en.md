Guocoland's profit attributable to equity holders was up 13% for the first half of the fiscal year ending June 30 to SG$74.6 million from SG$66.2 million a year earlier, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange on Monday.

Basic earnings per share rose to SG$0.0588 from SG$0.0513 in the comparable period.

Revenue declined 5% year over year to SG$1.01 billion from SG$1.07 billion in the year-ago period, mainly due to lower sales from China.
