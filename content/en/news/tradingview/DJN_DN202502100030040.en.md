Yields on euro-denominated and sterling-denominated corporate bonds declined last week, tracking falls in sovereign bond yields after the French budget passed through parliament and the Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points, CreditSights analysts say in a note. Average yields on euro investment-grade bonds fell 5 basis points to 3.1% while average yields on sterling investment-grade bonds declined 6bps to 5.3%, the analysts say. New supply of euro and sterling corporate bonds "showed no signs of slowing down," the analysts say. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
