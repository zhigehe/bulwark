Leidos Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of technology and engineering services, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. The company reported significant growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows, driven by strong demand across all customer segments and improved program execution.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter, Leidos reported revenues of $4.4 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. The company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $2.12, up 28% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.37, reflecting a 19% increase year-over-year. For the full fiscal year 2024, revenues reached $16.7 billion, an 8% increase from the previous year. Diluted EPS for the year was $9.22, a substantial 540% increase year-over-year, while non-GAAP diluted EPS was $10.21, up 40% from fiscal year 2023.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Leidos experienced robust performance across its business segments. The National Security & Digital segment reported revenues of $1.89 billion for the quarter, driven by higher volumes on digital modernization programs. The Health & Civil segment saw a 16% increase in quarterly revenues, reaching $1.33 billion, primarily due to increased volumes and case complexity within the managed health services business. The Commercial & International segment reported a 12% increase in quarterly revenues, totaling $604 million, driven by increased deliveries of security products and higher volumes within commercial energy and Australian IT businesses. The Defense Systems segment also saw a 7% increase in quarterly revenues, reaching $539 million.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Leidos continued to focus on shareholder returns, repurchasing $406 million in shares and paying $53 million in dividends during the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company returned $1.08 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, Leidos secured several notable contracts, including a $4.1 billion IDIQ contract for the U.S. Armyâ€™s Indirect Fires Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2 Program and a $2.6 billion contract with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for checkpoint sustainment.

**Management's Perspective**

Leidos CEO Tom Bell expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "2024 was a fantastic year for Leidos, as we delivered robust results at or above the high end of our guidance range across all metrics. The fourth quarter was especially strong in revenue growth and business development, driven by our focus on the enduring, mission-critical needs of our customers."

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to fiscal year 2025, Leidos has provided guidance for continued growth. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $16.9 billion to $17.3 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-high 12% range.
