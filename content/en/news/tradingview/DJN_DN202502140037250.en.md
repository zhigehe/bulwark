Segro's 2024 results show the industrial property market turned a corner in the second half, with property values increasing for the first time in several years, Quilter Cheviot analyst Oli Creasey says in a note. Although the increase was only 1.1%, the change in direction is an important datapoint, considering the cloud that U.K. real estate has been operating under since interest rates began increasing, Creasey says. Still, although property performance remains strong, earnings growth was muted due to a strong2023 comparison when Segro earned almost 90 million pounds from performance fees, he says. "Segro is invested in one of the more exciting property sectors, and the pipeline of European data center projects is particularly promising," Creasey adds. Shares are down 0.1% at 721.60 pence.(anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com)
