India's benchmark indexes opened little changed on Thursday, as investors digested easing domestic inflation data, while a hot U.S. inflation reading and mounting trade war concerns weighed.

The Nifty 50 fell 0.15% to 23,010.2 as of 9:30 a.m. IST, while the BSE Sensex shed 0.14% to 76,07.43. Both benchmarks had opened 0.2% higher.

The Nifty has opened flat or marginally positive in each of the last six sessions but closed lower, declining about 3% in the period.

On Wednesday, data signalled that U.S. consumer inflation picked up more than expected in January, raising prospects of fewer interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

Higher interest rates in the U.S. make emerging markets such as India less attractive for overseas investors.

The hot U.S. inflation reading offset the optimism from easing domestic retail inflation.

Trade war fears continued to intensify after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would soon impose reciprocal tariffs on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports.

On the day, seven of the 13 major sectors advanced. The broader and more domestically focussed smallcaps fell 0.3%, while midcaps traded flat.

Financials rose 0.5%, led by Kotak Mahindra Bank , after the Reserve Bank of India lifted the ban on the private lender from issuing credit cards and enrolling clients digitally.
