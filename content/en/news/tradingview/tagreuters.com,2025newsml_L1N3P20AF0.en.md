Key points:

* Hungarian monthly price growth is fastest in two years
* Analysts raise 2025 average inflation forecasts
* Forint gains as investors pare back interest rate-cut bets
* Orban's government raises idea of renewed price controls

Hungarian inflation (HUCPIY=ECI) surged to an annual rate of 5.5% in January, above analysts' forecasts, with monthly price growth accelerating to its fastest pace in two years as food, services and fuel prices all climbed.

Citing the risk of higher inflation and volatility in emerging markets, Hungary's central bank last month left its base rate at 6.5% - the joint highest rate in the European Union, and said monetary conditions needed to remain tight.

In 2023 Hungary recorded the EU's highest inflation rate at 17%, while its food prices have posted the bloc's steepest rise between 2022 and 2024 based on Eurostat figures.

Outgoing interest rate-setter Gyula Pleschinger, who had warned last week that January's annual inflation could exceed 5%, said there would be no scope for lowering rates all year amid an expected rebound in price growth to 4.1% to 4.2% from last year's 3.7%.

The forint firmed in morning trade as investors pared back lingering rate easing bets after the data.

"Inflation and core inflation both came in above the forecast range of the December inflation report," the central bank said in a statement, adding that the scale of monthly price changes also exceeded the long-term average in January.

It said household inflation expectations remained high after an increase in the second half of last year, when the forint fell to 22-month-lows versus the euro, while services and retail selling price expectations continued to rise.

The annual inflation rate beat even the highest analyst's forecast of 5.3%. Core inflation (HUCPIC=ECI) jumped more than a percentage point to 5.8%, also above analysts' forecasts.

"Inflation could remain outside the central bank's target band this year," Erste Bank economist Janos Nagy said, adding that Erste Bank would raise its 2025 inflation estimate.

ING economist Peter Virovacz said full-year inflation could average more than 5%, leaving no room for rate cuts this year.

Food prices rose an annual 6%, led by price jumps of 43.2% for flour, 25% for milk and 23.8% for eggs, the Central Statistics Office said. Services prices rose 8.5%, while fuel prices were 11.8% higher.

All key indicators ran well above the central bank's 2%-4% target range.

Economy Minister Marton Nagy, who on Monday hinted at reintroducing price caps, said in a Facebook post after Tuesday's data: "High food inflation is unacceptable, the government is ready to use all tools to protect families".

Nagy, who four months ago said Hungary had overcome the inflation crisis, said separately that the government did not rule out introducing mandatory price caps to keep food prices under control.

Orban's cabinet has previously capped fuel and certain food prices, triggering a fuel shortage and contributing to a surge in food prices, based on a central bank survey.
