Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed 0.87% higher at the start of a new week as the European Commission said it will react to the potential imposition of "unlawful" US tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday announced the potential 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US. The commission said it has not received any official notification concerning the additional tariffs but vowed to protect the interests of businesses, workers, and consumers in Europe from "unjustified measures." A formal announcement from the US government is expected Monday.

On the economic front, the UK is scheduled to release its gross domestic product figures for December and the fourth quarter of 2024 on Thursday. Analysts currently expect a 0.1% fall in the quarterly GDP, while the monthly economic growth is estimated at 0.1%.

In corporate news, BP (BP.L) rallied 7.26%, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 index, following reports that US-based Elliott Investment Management built an interest in the oil giant, urging it to take transformative steps towards improvement. While Bloomberg News could not identify the size of the activist fund's stake, it said the shareholding is "significant."

"In our view, BP should be reducing its leverage levels substantially, leaving it with more capacity to act countercyclically over time, however this would require a substantial cut to distributions in the near term, which may be negative for its shares," RBC Capital Markets said. "In sum, the bottom line is the introduction of a serious activist in BP shares is likely to cause some agitation for those underweight the shares, and we expect this to result in positive share price performance in the near term."

Goldman Sachs downgraded International Consolidated Airlines Group to neutral from buy but raised its price target to 3.75 pounds sterling from 3 pounds. The British Airways owner was the stock that lost the most at 3.36%.
