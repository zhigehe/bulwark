Hain Celestial Group widened its loss in its second quarter as challenges in its snacks business dragged down results.

The tea and snack maker widened its loss to about $104 million, or $1.15 a share, compared to $13.5 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.

Stripping out certain one-time items, earnings came in at 8 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss of 4 cents a share.

Hain said its loss included an aggregate non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $107 million related to U.S. goodwill and personal care intangible assets.

Sales declined to $411.5 million from $454.1 million. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $430.8 million.

"We drove sequential improvement in baby & kids and in our largest category, meal prep," said Chief Executive Wendy Davidson. "However, sales growth in the quarter was hindered by poor in-store performance in snacks, driven by marketing and promotion effectiveness, and supply chain challenge."

Hain forecast organic sales to decline between 2% and 4% in fiscal 2025. It previously guided for organic sales to be flat or better.
