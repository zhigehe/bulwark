Lenovo Group could be a key beneficiary of DeepSeek's breakthrough, UOB Kay Hian analysts Johnny Yum and Colin Lee say in a research note. The cheaper and more accessible AI features introduced by DeepSeek could encourage more enterprises, especially small- and mid-sized ones, to start investing in AI equipment, the analysts say. This could accelerate replacement demand for both PCs and servers, they add. Lenovo recently incorporated DeepSeek's AI model into its in-house AI assistant and is reportedly having more collaboration with the AI startup. UOB maintains a buy call on Lenovo and raises its target price to HK$14.30 from HK$12.00 on better visibility of the AI PC replacement cycle thanks to DeepSeek. Shares are 2.8% higher at HK$12.50.
