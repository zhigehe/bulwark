The Equities Market Review Group, created by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, submitted its first proposals to spur more listings and investments in Singapore's equities market, according to a media release on Thursday.

To boost the local equities market, the group proposed tax incentives for listings and investments. Their recommendations have been submitted to the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.

The proposals include measures to improve local firms' access to growth capital and attract enterprises with regional presence to list in the city-state.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore is the de-facto central bank of the Southeast Asian city-state.
