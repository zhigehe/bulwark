**Clinical Trials in Australia and India**: Aethlon Medical has launched safety, feasibility, and dose-finding clinical trials of the Hemopurifier in cancer patients with solid tumors in Australia and India. The trials aim to assess the safety of the Hemopurifier and its potential to decrease extracellular vesicles, which may improve the body's ability to attack tumor cells.

**FDA Breakthrough Device Designation**: The Hemopurifier has been designated as a Breakthrough Device by the FDA for treating advanced or metastatic cancer and life-threatening viruses not addressed by approved therapies, highlighting its potential impact in these areas.

**Potential Applications in Organ Transplantation**: Based on preclinical data, Aethlon is exploring the Hemopurifier's use in organ transplantation to remove harmful viruses and exosomes from recovered organs, potentially reducing transplantation complications and improving graft function.

**Impact of Global Events**: The company is closely monitoring the impact of inflation, geopolitical conflicts, and global instability on its business operations, which could affect timelines and access to capital.

**Future Outlook**: Aethlon plans to continue its clinical trials and expand its research on the Hemopurifier's applications in cancer and viral infections. The company is also focused on securing additional capital to support its operations and research activities.
