JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon dismissed employee complaints over the bank's five-day return-to-office policy and told staff not to waste time on petitions challenging it, multiple media outlets reported Wednesday and Thursday.

Dimon in a staff meeting said he does not care how many people sign an online petition urging him to reconsider the return-to-office policy, Reuters reported, adding that around 950 employees had signed the petition by Wednesday evening.

Dimon argued that remote work hurts efficiency and creativity, according to the report.

"We continue to invest in hiring new professionals where appropriate and currently have 14,000 open positions," a JPMorgan spokesperson reportedly said in a statement.

The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.
