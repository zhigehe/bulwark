Consumer stocks were mixed Wednesday afternoon, with the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) easing 0.1% and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) rising 0.3%.

In corporate news, Kraft Heinz offered a downbeat full-year earnings outlook on Wednesday as the company's Q4 net sales fell more than expected. Its shares fell 3.4%.

Restaurant Brands International reported stronger-than-expected Q4 results on Wednesday, driven by comparable sales gains at Tim Hortons and Burger King. Its shares rose 0.8%.

Lyft shares dropped 5.9% as the company issued a downbeat Q1 gross bookings outlook amid lower price trends in the US, while its revenue in the preceding three-month period missed market estimates.
