Equal treatment considerations and potential subsequent repair offering

The Private Placement has been considered by the Board in light of the equaltreatment obligations under the Norwegian Public Limited Liability CompaniesAct, the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, and the rules and guidelines onequaltreatment under Oslo Rule Book II for companies listed on Euronext Oslo Børs.The Board is of the opinion that the Private Placement is in compliance withthese requirements and guidelines. The issuance of the Offer Shares is carriedout as a private placement to inter alia partly fund the cash settlement oftheconsideration for the Totalbetong Acquisitions. By structuring the equityraiseas a private placement, the Company is able to efficiently raise capital fortheabovementioned purpose at a market-based offer price within the timeline fortheTotalbetong Acquisitions. In addition, the Company has received apre-commitmentand underwriting commitment from Kverva to reduce transaction risk.
