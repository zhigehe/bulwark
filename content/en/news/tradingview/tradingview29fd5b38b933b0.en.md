Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., operating primarily through Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., has released its Form 10-Q report for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The report highlights the company's financial performance and operational activities, focusing on community banking and investment services in Southern California.

**Financial Highlights**

**Net Income**: Provident Financial Holdings reported a net income of $872,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a significant decrease of 59% from $2.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2024. This decline is primarily attributed to a $586,000 provision for credit losses and a $450,000 increase in non-interest expense.

For the first six months of fiscal 2025, net income was $2.8 million, down 29% from $3.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2024. This reduction is due to a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense and a $538,000 decrease in net interest income.

**Diluted EPS**: The diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $0.13, down 58% from $0.31 in the same period last year. For the first six months, diluted EPS was $0.41, a decrease of 27% from $0.56 in the same period last year.

**Net Interest Income**: Net interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $8.8 million, a slight decrease of $15,000 compared to the same quarter last year. This was due to a lower average balance of interest-earning assets, partly offset by a higher net interest margin. For the first six months, net interest income was $17.4 million, a decrease of $538,000 or 3% from the same period in fiscal 2024.

**Total Interest Income**: Total interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $14.0 million, an increase of $356,000 or 3% from the same quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans receivable. For the first six months, total interest income was $28.1 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 4% from the same period of fiscal 2024.

**Total Interest Expense**: Total interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $5.3 million, an increase of $371,000 or 8% from the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher interest expense on time deposits. For the first six months, total interest expense was $10.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 18% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher interest expense on borrowings and time deposits.

**Business Highlights**

**Business Overview**: Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. operates primarily through Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., focusing on community banking and investment services in Southern California. The Bank's activities include attracting deposits and originating various types of loans, with a significant emphasis on single-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate loans.

**Geographical Performance**: The Bank's operations are concentrated in California, particularly in the Inland Empire region. As of December 31, 2024, the majority of loans held for investment are secured by real estate in California, with a notable portion in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

**Loan Portfolio**: As of December 31, 2024, the Bank's loan portfolio includes $533.1 million in single-family loans, $433.7 million in multi-family loans, and $78.0 million in commercial real estate loans. The Bank has implemented tighter underwriting standards for loans collateralized by office space due to elevated risks in the commercial real estate sector.

**Operational Strategy**: The Corporation aims to enhance its community banking business by moderately increasing total assets and focusing on expanding its loan portfolio. The strategy includes reducing the percentage of retail time deposits while increasing lower-cost checking and savings accounts.

**Risk Management**: The Corporation is actively managing risks associated with the California real estate market, interest rates, and economic conditions. The recent wildfires in California have not materially impacted the Bank's customers or collateral, but the Corporation remains vigilant in monitoring potential risks.

**Future Outlook**: The Corporation plans to continue its growth strategy by focusing on core revenue improvement through a higher net interest margin and increased net interest income. Management acknowledges that growth may be influenced by general economic conditions and other external factors.
