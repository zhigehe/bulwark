Lion Asiapac's profit attributable to equity holders declined 98% in fiscal Q2 to SG$11,000 from SG$507,000 a year earlier, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange on Thursday.

Earnings per share declined to SG$0.0001 compared with SG$0.0063 in the comparable period.

Revenue was down 12% year over year to SG$8.3 million from SG$9.4 million, mainly due to absence of steel trading orders.
