A dividend surprise may be on the cards for Bharti Airtel, given its robust free cash flow, continued deleveraging and early payment to the government to clear 2016 spectrum dues, Citi Research says. A push by the Indian telecom company's controlling shareholder, which recently raised its stake by issuing debt, could also drive a higher dividend payout, analyst Saurabh Handa writes in a note. Meanwhile, Airtel delivered another solid performance in 3Q, with sequential growth of nearly 6% in revenue and 9% in Ebitda for its India mobile-services segment, he says. Citi maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price of INR1,900. Shares are 0.7% higher at INR1,690. (farah.elias@wsj.com)
