President Trump signed separate orders imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.

“This is a big deal — making America rich again,” Trump says.

Earlier in the Oval Office, Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for former Illinois. Rod Blogolevich.

“It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people.”

Asked whether he’s considering appointing Blogolevich to ambassador of Serbia, Trump said: “No, but I would.”

Trump began his by signing a memo appointing 56 sub-Cabinet level positions.

Trump also signed a document designating Doug Collins to be the acting leader of both the Office of Special Counsel and the Office of Government Ethics.

Trump signed an executive order related to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

“It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump says.

Trump signs executive order for the federal government to go back to plastic straws and away from paper straws.

“We’re going back to plastic straws. These things don’t work,” Trump says. “I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.”

“As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock -- I think it's an appropriate time -- I would say, cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out. I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday. And if they're not returned -- all of them, not in drips and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two – by Saturday at 12 o'clock. And after that, I would say, all hell is going to break out.”

“Saturday at 12, we want them all back. I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it, but from myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, and if they're not, they're not here, all hell is going to break out.”

Trump later said: “Saturday at 12 o'clock, and after that, it's going to be a different ball game.”

Asked my me whether he means retaliation from Israel when he says “all hell will break out,” Trump said: “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out to. Hamas will find out what I mean.”

Asked whether he can rule out any US involvement after the Saturday deadline, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens.”
