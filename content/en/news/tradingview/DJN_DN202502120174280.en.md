The Reserve Bank of India will likely cut rates by 25 bps again in April, Rahul Bajoria of BofAS India writes in a note. Easing food inflation and softer domestic economic growth gives the RBI space to cut rates further, though it remains dependent on the global economic developments, says the economist. The monetary policy has pivoted firmly to support growth, as medium-term inflation forecasts for RBI are broadly aligned with its 4% target, and core CPI remains benign, Bajoria says. He expects a total of 75 bps additional rate cuts through 2025 to bring the repo rate to 5.50% by year-end. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)
