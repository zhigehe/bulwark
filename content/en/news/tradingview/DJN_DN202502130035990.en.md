Commerzbank's targets for revenue and operating leverage appear punchy, RBC Capital Markets says in a research note after the German lender outlined a fresh midterm strategy. The new plan points to stronger top-line growth while keeping a lid on costs, with higher capital distributions an extra driver of shareholder returns. The bank is targeting a 15% return on tangible equity--a key profitability measure--for 2028 and a 13.6% return in 2027, ahead of consensus' 11.1% for the latter year. "We are awaiting to get more confidence in the Capital Markets Day presentations with some of this likely to be a function of 'seeing is believing'," analyst Anke Reingen writes. She adds that 2025 guidance points to better profit on higher revenue, which will more than offset higher loan losses. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)
