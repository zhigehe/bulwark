The strong momentum in China's sportswear industry is likely to continue, according to Deutsche Bank Research analyst Jessie Xu in a commentary. Online sales growth of sportswear remained robust, with 26% on year growth in January, Xu says. While February may prove challenging as demand was front-loaded into January, a few positive signals, such as improved store traffic and government stimulus, may support growth, Xu says. Industry participants are expecting retail sales to grow in the range of mid-single-digits to low-double-digits, the analyst says, citing DB's industry checks. A bull case would be over 10%, and a bear case would be mid-single-digits to high-single-digits percentage, particularly if any international brands are hurt by the intensifying U.S.-China tensions, Xu says.(tracy.qu@wsj.com)
