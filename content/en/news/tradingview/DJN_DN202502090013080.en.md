It seems the U.S. tariff threat never sleeps, with U.S. President Donald Trump's declaration of sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs sparking a U.S. dollar bounce to start the week, says Sean Callow, currency market analyst at InTouch Capital Markets. But those choosing to look on the bright side can point to the slump in U.S. consumer sentiment and surge in inflation expectations reported Friday as something that might ultimately produce a less aggressive approach on the trade front, he adds. AUD/USD is likely to struggle through the tariff headlines, but probably avoiding last week's slide under 0.6100, he adds. AUD/USD now 0.6253. (james.glynn@wsj.com ; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
