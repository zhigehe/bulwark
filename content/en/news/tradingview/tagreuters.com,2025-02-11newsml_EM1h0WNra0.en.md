Photon Energy Group Reports Lower-Than-Expected Preliminary EBITDA for Q4 and FY 2024

Podstawa prawna

Art. 17 ust. 1 MAR - informacje poufne.

Treść raportu:

The Management Board of Photon Energy N.V. announces that, upon closing the accounting books and

finalizing the collection of financial data for Q4 2024 and the full year 2024, the preliminary

results will deviate from the guidance published in ESPI report 34/2024, in particular:

• Preliminary consolidated EBITDA is expected to be EUR 8.7 million, representing a shortfall of

13% compared to the guided amount of EUR 10 million.

• Preliminary consolidated revenues are expected to be EUR 89.2 million, close to the lower end

of the guided range of EUR 90-100 million.

Lower than expected operating results are stemming from the combination of the following factors

including but not limited to:

- Reversal of the first instalment of other gain realized in Q2 2024 on the sale of the 20.4 MW

solar PV project in Poland for the amount of EUR 0.9 million. This gain has been reversed in Q4 2024

due to the postponement of project completion into 2025.

- EUR 0.25 million of higher-than-expected costs related to restructuring and severance payments.

- EUR 0.3 million of write-offs resulting from a balance sheet review and the clearance of old

working capital positions.

Based on the preliminary results, the adjusted equity ratio is currently at the level of 25.7%.

These preliminary financial estimates have not been audited by a statutory auditor and are subject

to change.
