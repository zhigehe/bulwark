Lotte Wellfood will raise the prices of 26 snack products, including Pepero, Ghana Mild, and Cruncky, by an average of 9.5%, citing surging cocoa costs and fast-changing exchange rates, Pulse News reported Friday.

This follows a 12% price hike in June last year. The company attributed the move to record cocoa prices, higher logistics expenses, and other cost-related pressures, the report said.

Shares of the South Korean confectionery company rose nearly 4% at market close on Monday.
