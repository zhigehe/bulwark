* Completed a 24-hour run on February 12, processing 11,573 barrels, surpassing the 10,000 barrel per day (“bpd”) milestone
* Built and deployed Volt’s largest DLE system in just four weeks, from mid-January to early February

CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Volt Lithium Corp. (TSXV: VLT | OTCQB: VLTLF) (“Volt” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the successful **24-hour continuous run** of its **Generation 5 Field Unit** in the Permian Basin, Texas. Constructed **in just four weeks** through **close collaboration with Volt’s partner**, this large-scale Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) system was **too large for testing** at the Company’s Calgary demonstration facility, highlighting the advancement in Volt’s design and engineering capabilities.

Integration with the partner’s operational specifications enabled **seamless installation** and provides a **template for future scale-up** to meet expanding production demands. On **February 12**, the Generation 5 Field Unit processed **11,573 barrels** during the continuous run—exceeding the initial 10,000 barrels per day milestone—and further demonstrating Volt’s ability to rapidly commercialize its proprietary DLE technology.

“During this 24-hour run, our Generation 5 Field Unit processed 11,573 barrels, surpassing the 10,000 bpd milestone,” said Alex Wylie, President & CEO of Volt. “We have begun stockpiling lithium, confirming the commercial viability of our Direct Lithium Extraction technology, and this success positions us on track for our 2025 goals as the system is built to process even higher volumes.”

Permian Basin Field Operations: Generation 5 Launch

* **Largest DLE System to Date:** Generation 5 marks the largest system Volt has constructed, moving directly from modular assembly to full-scale field operations.
* **Fast-Track Deployment:** Project execution began in mid-January, and the full system was operational within **four weeks**—underscoring Volt’s ability to rapidly scale production.
* **Path to Peak Capacity:** Having exceeded the 10,000 bpd threshold, Volt will continue system testing and optimization throughout February to determine the Field Unit’s **peak throughput potential**.

**Tariff Exemption Update**

Recent discussions about potential new tariffs on Canadian imports **do not affect** Volt. By sourcing equipment and materials from **U.S.-based suppliers**, operating in **Texas**, and targeting **domestic customers**, Volt remains **exempt** from these proposed measures. This strategic approach positions Volt as a **low-cost, domestic operator** in the oilfield brine lithium sector bolstering its commitment to delivering a dependable U.S.-based supply source.
