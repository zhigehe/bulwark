Malaysia's 2025 GDP growth is likely to slow this year, though domestic demand will stay strong and exports will moderate but remain resilient, OCBC senior Asean economist Lavanya Venkateswaran says in a note. She sees the economy growing at 4.5% versus 5.1% last year. Household and investment spending should remain firm, while electrical exports could grow at a slower pace, she reckons. External risks have risen with potential U.S. tariffs targeting Malaysia's trade surplus, she adds. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.7% in 2025 from 1.8% in 2024 due to the fuel subsidy reforms, but underlying pressures should stay contained, she says. The central bank is likely to keep rates at 3.00% in 2025, though a hike remains possible if it sees strong signs of persistent demand-side inflation, she adds. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
