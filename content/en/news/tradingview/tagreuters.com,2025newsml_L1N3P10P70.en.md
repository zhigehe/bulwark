German Bund yields edged down on Monday, near their lowest levels in over a month, as caution prevailed after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and said he would announce reciprocal duties early this week.

Investors turned their focus back to possible U.S. import duties and deflationary risks for the euro area late on Friday after U.S. economic data drove yields higher.

Trump said on Sunday he would introduce new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the United States.

Germany's 10-year bond yield (DE10YT=RJR), the benchmark for the euro zone bloc, was down 2.5 basis points (bps) at 2.355%. It hit 2.345% on Wednesday, its lowest level since January 2.

Analysts expect import duties on European countries to have a significant negative impact on economic growth, while inflationary pressures from potential European retaliation would likely be negligible.

The European Commission said on Monday it would react to protect EU interests but added it would not respond until it had detailed or written clarification of the measures.

Trump also promised detailed information on Tuesday or Wednesday on his reciprocal tariff plan.

"Markets fear that Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' could further weigh on the already gloomy growth outlook for the euro area," said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.

Money markets priced in an ECB deposit facility rate at 1.86% in December (EURESTECBM7X8=ICAO). They discounted 1.85% after Trump announced tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico early this month.

German two-year government bond yields (DE2YT=RJR), more sensitive to European Central Bank rate expectations, fell 3.5 bps to 2.02%.

The yield spread between OATS and Bund (DE10FR10=RJR) — a market gauge of the risk premium investors demand to hold French debt — stood at 72.1 bps after the French Senate approved on Thursday the 2025 budget.

Italy's 10-year yield (IT10YT=RJR) fell 2.5 bps at 3.449%, and the gap between Italian and German yields (DE10IT10=RJR) stood at 108.5 bps.

Investor morale in the euro zone brightened in February to its highest since July, a survey showed on Monday, with Germany also benefiting from the rise in confidence.
