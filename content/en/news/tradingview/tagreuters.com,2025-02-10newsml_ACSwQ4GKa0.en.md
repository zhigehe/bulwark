BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / Electric vehicle (EV) sales increased by 24% globally in 2024, highlighting the growing importance of EV safety. With EVs becoming an increasingly large part of the fleet, their safety becomes evermore important. While most data shows EV fires are less common than those combustion engine vehicles, safety cannot be overlooked in any rate of occurrence and fire protection remains crucial. According to the report from market intelligence firm IDTechEx, "Fire Protection Materials for EV Batteries 2025-2035: Markets, Trends, and Forecasts", the market for these materials is expected to grow at a 15% CAGR from 2024 to 2035.![](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-10:newsml_ACSwQ4GKa-8870e8faa81b47445667d255389a4731-resized.jpeg)

A primary consideration is the battery cell form factor. IDTechEx found that in 2024 around 58% of the market was using prismatic cells followed by 22% cylindrical, and the rest pouch. The cell form factor may not impact protection at a module or pack level, but will certainly impact inter-cell materials.

Prismatic and pouch cell systems often use sheet-type materials, whereas cylindrical cells typically employ encapsulating foams. The failure mode also varies by cell type.

How the temperature of the cells is managed is another critical decision. A popular approach is through a cold plate that sits at the top or bottom of the cells through which water-glycol coolant is passed. Another method is to cool the sides of the cells, too, or have heat-spreading materials between the cells to transfer as much heat away from the cells as possible.

Even once the cell form factor and thermal management strategy are decided, there are a host of different material categories and chemistries that could be valid options.

A large variety of factors will go into the choice of fire protection material, and it will include factors like cell form factor, pack design, thermal management approach, material costs, system costs, regulation to be met, and a wide variety of other factors. Each material has its own tradeoffs and needs to be evaluated for each battery design.

In terms of the current market, encapsulating foams and mica currently dominate material demand. However, as the market progresses IDTechEx is predicting that newer emerging options will start to eat into this market share. Some of these newer options include aerogels, and intumescent polymers and coatings.
