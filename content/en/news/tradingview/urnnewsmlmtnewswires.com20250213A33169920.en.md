National Bank of Canada cut its price target on the shares of NanoXplore to $3.00 from $3.50 while maintaining its outperfom rating in a note dated Feb. 12, after the company reported fiscal second-quarter results a day earlier.

NanoXplore reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, driven by higher sales, compared with a year-ago loss figure of $92,806.

Total revenues rose 14% to $33.1 million in Q2, compared with $29.1 million, a year ago.

National Bank analyst Rupert Merer said, "Government funding for its CSPG and dry graphene materials initiative is pending approval of its power connection from Hydro Quebec. We remain cautiously optimistic that the new production could be online in 12 months but see some risk to tax credits from potential change in government in Canada."

The bank lowered the company's price target due to a higher discount rate and because the bank pushed out forecasts for growth.
