Physically traded domestic crude grades broadly rose on Monday, dealers said, as domestic refining demand is set to tick higher.

U.S. oil refiners are expected to have about 1.5 million barrels per day of capacity offline in the week ending Feb. 14, increasing available refining capacity by 84,000 bpd, research company IIR Energy said on Friday.

Offline capacity is expected to fall to 1.29 million bpd for the week ending February 21, IIR added.

Capping gains, U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles were expected to have risen last week, while distillate inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.

Five analysts polled by Reuters estimated on average that crude inventories rose by about 2.6 million barrels in the week to February 7.
