TIRANA (Albania), February 12 (SeeNews) - Albania has issued a 650 million euro ($674.6 million) Eurobond, local media reported.

The Eurobonds have a maturity of ten years, with 5% yield, as investor demand for the issue reached 3.7 billion euro, economy news provider Monitor reported on Tuesday.

The government will use the proceeds to help cover the 2025 budget deficit and refinance a Eurobond issued in 2018, the report reads.

This is the seventh Eurobond issue for Albania. The country issued a 600 million euro five-year Eurobond in June 2023. Prior to that, Albania issued a 650 million euro ten-year Eurobond in 2021, a 650 million euro seven-year Eurobond in 2020, a 500 million euro seven-year Eurobond in 2018 and a 450 million-euro five-year Eurobond in 2015. The first 300 million euro Eurobond was issued in 2010.

($ = 0.964 euro)
