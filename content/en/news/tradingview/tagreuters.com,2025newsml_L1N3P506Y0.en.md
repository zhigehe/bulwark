A break below $10.22 may trigger a drop into the $9.98-3/4 to $10.08-1/4 range. The bias, however, seems to be towards the upside, not only because the contract is testing $10.33, but also because it has stabilized around key support zone of $10.20-1/2 to $10.22.

A break above $10.33, which is highly likely, could trigger a gain to $10.44-1/4. On the daily chart, the contract has managed to hover above support at $10.29-1/4.

A bounce is developing, which is classified as a pullback toward a rising trendline. The bounce may be limited to $10.48-3/4.
