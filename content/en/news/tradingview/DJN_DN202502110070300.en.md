The Securities and Exchange Commission's new leadership has begun the process of dismantling former Chair Gary Gensler's climate disclosure rule, a fiercely contested initiative that would have required public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

The rule, finalized last year, has been the subject of legal challenges. In a statement Tuesday, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda said he was directing staff to temporarily pause their defense of the rule.

Specifically, Uyeda has asked staff to request that an appeals court, which is currently handling the litigation, delay arguments while the SEC's commissioners deliberate about next steps.

"I continue to question the statutory authority of the commission to adopt the rule, the need for the rule, and the evaluation of costs and benefits," Uyeda said.
