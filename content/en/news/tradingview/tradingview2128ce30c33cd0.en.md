RGC Resources Inc., a company primarily engaged in the regulated sale and distribution of natural gas through its Roanoke Gas subsidiary, has released its latest Form 10-Q report. The report highlights significant financial and operational achievements for the recent quarter, reflecting the company's strategic initiatives and market performance.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Operating Revenues**: $27.29 million, increased by approximately 12% primarily due to the implementation of a non-gas base rate increase, along with higher delivered volumes and gas costs.

**Gross Utility Margin**: $15.56 million, increased by $1.27 million or 9% from the same period last year, primarily due to new non-gas base rates and increases in SAVE and RNG revenues.

**Net Income**: $5.27 million, increased by $249,697 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the implementation of new non-gas base rates, slightly offset by lower WNA revenues and higher interest expense.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments**: The company's primary revenue source is the regulated sale and distribution of natural gas through its Roanoke Gas subsidiary, serving approximately 63,400 customers in Roanoke, Virginia, and surrounding areas. The company also derives revenue from its investment in the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) and Southgate projects.

**Geographical Performance**: The company's operations are concentrated in Roanoke, Virginia, and surrounding localities, with regulatory oversight from the State Corporation Commission (SCC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

**Sales Units**: For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the company delivered 3,495,402 dekatherms (DTH) of regulated natural gas, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. This includes a 4% increase in residential and commercial volumes and a 43% increase in transportation and interruptible volumes.

**New Production Launches**: The company began operating a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facility in March 2023, in cooperation with the Western Virginia Water Authority, to produce commercial quality RNG for its distribution system.

**Operational Highlights**: The company implemented new non-gas base rates effective July 1, 2024, which contributed to increased revenues. The MVP entered into service on June 14, 2024, providing interruptible and short-term firm transportation service, with long-term firm capacity obligations commencing on July 1, 2024.

**Future Outlook**: The company expects continued higher usage from a multi-fuel customer, although much of this volume has a lower margin contribution. The company also anticipates ongoing investments in infrastructure projects under the SAVE Plan, with expected annualized revenues of approximately $1,389,000 during fiscal 2025.
