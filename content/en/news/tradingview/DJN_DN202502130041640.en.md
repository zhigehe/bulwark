Yields on U.K. government bonds, or gilts, fall slightly after U.K. GDP data showed modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the three months to September. U.K. monthly real GDP grew 0.4% in December, stronger than the consensus forecast of 0.1% by economists in a WSJ poll. The GDP data was slightly above forecasts but it remains weak, raising concerns about the U.K. economy, MoneyFarm's Richard Flax says in a note. "As policymakers and businesses digest these GDP figures, they are likely to remain focused on the challenge of generating stronger economic growth against backdrop of uncertainty around tariffs," he says. The 10-year gilt yield declines 2 basis points to 4.534%, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
