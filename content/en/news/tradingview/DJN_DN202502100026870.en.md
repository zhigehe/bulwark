By Adam Clark

Cryptocurrency prices were mixed on Monday as Bitcoin gained but XRP and other smaller digital currencies fell. Investors are digesting the latest tariff plans from the Trump administration.

Bitcoin was up 1.1% to $97,861 over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinDesk.

President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from Monday. Cryptos have previously fallen on tariff announcements but such news might now be priced in as Bitcoin has dropped below $100,000.

"Crypto continues to tread water, with Bitcoin staying below $100K in February, waiting to hear how the new administration plans to become the "crypto capital of the world,"

XRP — the popular altcoin that has in the past few months soared to compete with Tether for the title of third largest cryptocurrency by market value — is down 0.7% over the past 24 hours to $2.45, according to CoinDesk.

Ether — the second-largest crypto — was down 0.3%.
