Operating profit at Italian outerwear maker Moncler rose to 916 million euros ($955.11 million) last year, the company said on Thursday, beating a company-provided analysts consensus for an increase to 878 million euros.

Full-year consolidated revenues rose 7% at constant exchange rates, also exceeding a company-provided consensus.

In the fourth quarter, revenues at the luxury group rose 8% at constant exchange rates, helped by double digit growth in mainland China for the Moncler brand.

($1 = 0.9590 euros)
