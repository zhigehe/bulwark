Morgan Stanley Research said the recent earnings report of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co for Distribution (ADX:ADNOCDIST), d/b/a Adnoc Distribution, did not change its investment thesis on the group but that it is overall positive.

"GCC volumes remain a corollary of ADNOC Distribution's performance, with retail volumes increasing 8.9% y/y. But more than that, retail margins were once again a positive surprise, with EBITDA in the segment beating MSe by 6.8%," the Tuesday note said.

Analysts also noted the Abu Dhabi-based fuel distributor's plans to add up to 40 new dealer-owned company-operated stations in Saudi Arabia, saying that this could support "a greater focus" on network expansion.
