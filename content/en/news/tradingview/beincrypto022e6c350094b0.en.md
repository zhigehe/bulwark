Binance Coin is showing signs of recovery after a period of bearish momentum. The altcoin has made an attempt to break through key resistance levels, which, if successful, could trigger a rally in the coming weeks.

Improving broader market conditions further supports BNB’s potential upward movement.

**BNB Might Follow Bitcoin’s Price Pattern**

BNB shares a strong correlation of 0.90 with Bitcoin, indicating that the altcoin often moves in tandem with the crypto king. Given Bitcoin’s attempt to reclaim the $100,000 support level, this correlation could work in BNB’s favor, boosting its chances of a sustained rally.

If Bitcoin manages to hold above $100,000, BNB could see increased buying pressure. A strengthening BTC price historically leads to positive spillover effects for correlated assets. This trend could help BNB solidify its recovery and push toward higher resistance levels in the near future.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests that bearish momentum is fading. The MACD line is nearing a bullish crossover, a technical signal that could indicate a shift from bearish to bullish momentum.

If the crossover occurs, it would mark the first time in nearly a month that BNB transitions to a bullish trend. This development could attract fresh buying interest, further supporting the altcoin’s upward trajectory and reinforcing market confidence.

**BNB Price Prediction: Aiming For Recovery**

BNB has surged by 7% over the past 24 hours, successfully breaking through the resistance zone between $586 and $619. Currently trading at $621, the altcoin is in the process of flipping the $619 resistance into support. Holding this level would be crucial for maintaining the bullish outlook.

With favorable technical and market conditions, BNB could rise toward $647. A successful breach of this level would pave the way for the altcoin to reach $650, solidifying its recovery. Positive sentiment across the crypto market would further enhance BNB’s chances of sustaining this uptrend.

However, if BNB fails to hold $619 as support, a retracement could follow. Falling through this support zone could send the altcoin back below $586. A continued decline toward $550 would invalidate the bullish thesis, signaling a potential return to bearish conditions.
