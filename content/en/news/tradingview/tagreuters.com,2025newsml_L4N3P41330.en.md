\*\* Biogen on Wednesday forecast 2025 profit below Wall Street estimates, hit by a stronger dollar and a sharp drop in sales for its multiple sclerosis drugs

\*\* Median PT of 37 analysts covering BIIB is $200 - data compiled by LSEG

LEQEMBI'S LONG-TERM GROWTH

\*\* Oppenheimer ("outperform", PT: $255) says co's Alzheimer's disease drug Leqembi's Q4 in-market sales of $87 mln reflects steady growth, and expects the trend to continue in 2025

\*\* "We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity of Leqembi, while expecting those catalysts to take time to translate to growth expansion," brokerage says

\*\* BMO Capital Markets ("market perform", PT:$139) says Leqembi growth, especially outside the U.S., appears to show increasing momentum that could be further improved with approval for a subcutaneous version of the drug later in the year

\*\* But the brokerage says that for now it does not expect this growth to offset declines in co's multiple sclerosis drug sales, "though see improvements as incrementally positive"

\*\* J.P.Morgan ("neutral," PT: $185) says, "We see some catalysts for Leqembi, but launch likely to remain gradual in near term"

\*\* William Blair ("outperform,") on Leqembi says "expect regulatory decisions on subcutaneous, auto-injector maintenance and initiation, in H22025 and H12026, respectively, to be bigger growth drivers"
