Slovakia’s economy expanded by 1.8% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, surpassing market expectations of 1.6% and accelerating from a 1.2% rise in the previous period, according to preliminary estimates.

The faster growth was driven by strong domestic demand, particularly household and public administration spending, while a decline in investment activity weighed on overall expansion.

On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, GDP rose 0.5%, up from 0.3% in the September quarter.

For the full year, Slovakia's economy expanded by 2%.
