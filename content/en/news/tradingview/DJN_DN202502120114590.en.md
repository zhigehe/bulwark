Masco will look to bolster its track record of managing tariffs. The owner of Behr paint, Delta faucets and other home products issued guidance for 2025 and says it includes the impact from recently enacted tariffs on China. The company notes its estimates are net of mitigation actions and do not include the impacts from any potential future tariffs. Jefferies analysts say pricing is one of the main levers Masco will use to offset tariff impact, though they expect a mismatch between price and costs in 1H25 before turning positive in 2H25 as negotiations play out. The analysts also note that the company has limited exposure to Canada, while Mexico is a significant piece of its spa business. CEO Keith Allman on an earnings call said Masco can move products from Mexico to its manufacturing hub in Southern California. Masco is off 2.2% to $76.90. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)
