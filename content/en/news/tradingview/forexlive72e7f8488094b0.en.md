Here is a telling chart from Scotia highlighting gold year-end targets from Wall Street for 2025-2027. It shows nearly no one at or above spot and the consensus way below the current price of $2905.

![Gold consensus forecasts](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/forexlive:72e7f8488094b-c8dc2bc89ddeb1fb7bfac0a0d8b1fe17-resized.jpeg)

As for Scotia, they highlight a handful of drivers and potential drivers for gold in the year ahead:

They noted that gold tends to perform well when real rates are below 2% and that inflation is on its way to the Fed's target.

An interesting note is that Chinese consumers are turning away from jewellery buying due to a soft economy and high prices. Q4 buying fell 29% y/y. That's been offset by investment demand but it's a worrisome trend (or an opportunity if the economy improves).

As for the whales, central bank buying was up 54% y/y in Q4 while production was flat. For all of 2024, they added 650 tonnes to reserves and Scotia sees 700 tonnes added this year.

5 Things to Watch:

* Interest Rates: The Fed started cutting rates in late 2024 and Scotiabank expects 50bps of cuts in both 2025 and 2026. A more-rapid pace of cuts could boost good.
* U.S. Dollar Trajectory: Scotia sees the Dollar Index weakening to ~107 in 2025 and ~105 in 2026, which would support gold prices if realized, though not much from 108 at spot.
* Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and uncertainty around Trump trade policies could drive safe-haven demand.
* ETF Flows: After outflows in early 2024, ETFs saw inflows in Q4. Continued investment demand will be a critical spot to watch.
* Central Bank Buying: The pace of official sector purchases, particularly from China, India, and Poland looking to diversify reserves, remains a key demand driver.

Gold touched a record high of $2910 today in a $45 rally.
