South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy convened an emergency meeting on Monday to assess the fallout from the US' plan to impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, Yonhap News reported the same day.

Officials from POSCO Holdings and Hyundai Steel joined the discussions on response strategies. US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement sparked concerns, with South Korea accounting for 13% of US steel imports.

Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won vowed a proactive approach, using all available networks to safeguard local industries. Hyundai Steel and POSCO said they are closely monitoring developments amid ongoing uncertainties, according to the report.
