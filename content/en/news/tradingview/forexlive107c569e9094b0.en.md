Key points:

* Trump's latest tariff measures could have impact on French industry
* Europe should respond in a united and firm manner to Trump's tariffs
* Hopes that the response will happen soon

Any retaliation should likely come after Trump enacts reciprocal tariffs, if it happens. But on metal tariffs, Germany will be the one to feel the pinch the most as they are the fourth largest exporter of steel and ninth largest exporter of aluminum to the US.
