CelcomDigi's outlook appears less appealing, Maybank IB analyst Tan Chi Wei says in a note. Given the telco's weaker-than-expected 4Q 2024 results and more conservative 2025 guidance, a sharp net profit recovery may not materialize, he reckons. Even though unchanged merger synergy savings is positive, elevated IT capital expenditure could limit earnings growth, he adds. Tan cuts CelcomDigi's 2025-2026 net profit estimates by 25% and 28%, respectively, to reflect the company's tepid guidance. Maybank downgrades CelcomDigi's rating to hold from buy and cuts its target price to MYR3.80 from MYR4.50. Shares are 1.0% lower at MYR3.83. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
