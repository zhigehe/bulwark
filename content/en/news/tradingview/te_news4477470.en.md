The annual inflation rate in Switzerland fell to 0.4% in January 2025, in line with market expectations and down from 0.6% in December.

This marks the lowest level since April 2021, driven by ongoing deflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages (-1.1% vs. -0.9% in December), clothing and footwear (-0.1% vs. -1.4%), household goods and services (-1.4% vs. -2.3%), healthcare (-0.6% vs. -0.8%), and transport (-0.8% vs. -1.9%).

Additionally, price growth slowed for housing and energy (1.6% vs. 3.4%) and recreation and culture (0.5% vs. 1.1%).

Meanwhile, the annual core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as unprocessed food and energy, rose to 0.9% from 0.7% in December.

On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1%, matching the previous period's pace.
