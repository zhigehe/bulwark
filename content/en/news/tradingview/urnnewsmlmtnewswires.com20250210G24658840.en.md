Zuiko has joined the Circular Economy Partnership for Promoting Municipal Solid Waste Recycling Technology, alongside nine organizations from industry, government, and academia, according to a Monday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The partnership aims to enhance municipal waste recycling, focusing on plastics not covered by Japan's Containers and Packaging Recycling Law and used diaper recycling.

Zuiko, as part of its mid-term strategy, is developing equipment to convert used diapers into fuel, addressing waste concerns tied to Japan's aging population.

The initiative will test recycling methods, share findings, and explore commercialization potential, with new participants welcome.
