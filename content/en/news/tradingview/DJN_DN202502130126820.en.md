Base metal prices are mixed, with LME three-month copper up 0.1% at $9,481.0 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum down 0.9% at $2,602 a ton. Copper made some gains to sit 2.4% higher on week, while aluminum has slipped 0.7%. Trading volumes have been relatively thin ahead of expectations of the next round of President Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs. On Monday, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports, in addition to previously announced 10% levies on Chinese imports and delayed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. The effect so far on LME prices has been relatively muted, though U.S. premiums have risen to accommodate expectations of higher prices. Trump plans reciprocal tariffs targeting any country that has imposed U.S. levies, promising to sign the order later Thursday. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)
