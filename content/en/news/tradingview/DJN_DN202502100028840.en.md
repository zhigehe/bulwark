Core income for the quarter was $342 million, or $1.25 per share, versus $362 million, or $1.33 per share, in the prior year quarter.

Our Property & Casualty segments produced core income of $451 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $17 million compared to the prior year quarter resulting from higher investment income and higher underlying underwriting income partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our Life & Group segment produced a core loss of $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 versus core income of $4 million in the prior year quarter. Our Corporate & Other segment produced a core loss of $91 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 versus $76 million in the prior year quarter.

Our Property & Casualty segments produced core income of $1,549 million for the full year 2024, an increase of $44 million compared to the prior year primarily attributed to higher investment income and higher underlying underwriting income partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. P&C segments, excluding third party captives, generated gross written premium and net written premium growth of 8%, due to new business growth of 9% and written rate of +4%.

Our Life & Group segment produced a core loss of $23 million for the full year 2024 versus $48 million in the prior year. Our Corporate & Other segment produced a core loss of $210 million for the full year 2024 versus $173 million in the prior year.

"In the fourth quarter we continued to produce excellent results with $342 million of core income leading to record core income of $1,316 million for the full year. We achieved record levels of underlying underwriting gain in the quarter and for the full year. Net investment income was up 5% for the quarter and 10% for the year.

The P&C all-in combined ratio was 93.1% in the quarter and included 1.8 points of catastrophe loss. The underlying combined ratio was 91.4%, which marks 16 consecutive quarters below 92%.

Gross written premium excluding captives grew 9% in the quarter and net written premium was up 10%, the strongest quarterly growth of the year. New business grew 8% in the quarter and 9% for the year to a record high of nearly $2.3 billion.

Rate continues to be an area of focus in the lines most impacted by social inflation. In those lines, there is a need for continued pricing discipline and our rate achievement continues to exceed our estimate of long-run loss cost trend. Retention was 86% and was strong in all segments.

We are extremely pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. Reflective of our consistent strategic execution, AM Best and Moody's recently revised their outlooks on CNA's financial strength and debt ratings from stable to positive. CNA is well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities in 2025 and to continue to deliver sustained, profitable growth," said Douglas M. Worman, President & Chief Executive Officer of CNA Financial Corporation.

Core loss increased $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared with the prior year quarter. The application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to additional cessions to the A&EP LPT in both periods resulted in after-tax non-economic charges of $35 million and $24 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The additional cessions in those periods were $103 million and $86 million, respectively. The current quarter also includes a $17 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort claims compared to a $12 million after-tax charge in the prior year quarter.

Core loss increased $37 million for the full year as compared with the prior year. The current year includes higher corporate expenses as a result of continued investments in technology and an unfavorable non-economic impact related to the A&EP LPT. The current year also includes a $62 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort claims compared with a $56 million after-tax charge in the prior year.

Net investment income increased $33 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 and $233 million for the full year driven by favorable limited partnership and common stock returns, as well as higher income from fixed income securities as a result of a larger invested asset base and favorable reinvestment rates.

Stockholders' Equity

Stockholders' equity of $10.5 billion improved 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to net income partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders.

Book value per share ex AOCI of $46.16 increased 8% from year-end 2023 adjusting for $3.76 of dividends per share.

As of December 31, 2024, statutory capital and surplus for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies was $11.2 billion.

Earnings Remarks & Materials

A transcript of earnings remarks will be available on CNA's website at www.cna.com via the Investor Relations section. Remarks will include commentary from the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Douglas M. Worman, and Chief Financial Officer, Scott R. Lindquist. An earnings presentation and financial supplement information related to the results will also be posted and available on the CNA website.

Definition of Reported Segments

* Specialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters.
* Commercial works with a network of brokers and independent agents to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products to all types of insureds targeting small business, construction, middle markets and other commercial customers.
* International underwrites property and casualty coverages on a global basis through a branch operation in Canada, a European business consisting of insurance companies based in the U.K and Luxembourg and Hardy, our Lloyd's Syndicate.
* Life & Group includes the individual and group run-off long-term care businesses as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants.
* Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re, asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP), a legacy portfolio of excess workers' compensation (EWC) policies and legacy mass tort reserves.

Financial Measures

Management utilizes the following metrics in their evaluation of the Property & Casualty Operations.

These ratios are calculated using financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

* Loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums.
* Underlying loss ratio represents the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items.
* Expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums.
* Dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums.
* Combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the expense and the dividend ratio.
* Underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss, the expense ratio and the dividend ratio.

The underlying loss ratio and the underlying combined ratio are deemed to be non-GAAP financial measures, and management believes some investors may find these ratios useful to evaluate our underwriting performance since they remove the impact of catastrophe losses, which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year underwriting performance. The components to reconcile the combined ratio and loss ratio to the underlying combined ratio and underlying loss ratio for Property & Casualty, Specialty, Commercial and International segments are set forth on pages 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes.

Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change.

Exposure represents the measure of risk used in the pricing of the insurance product. The change in exposure represents the change in premium dollars on policies that renew as a result of the change in risk of the policy.

Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed, excluding rate and exposure changes, in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew.

New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.

Gross written premiums ex. 3(rd) party captives represents gross written premiums excluding business which is ceded to third party captives, including business related to large warranty programs.

Development-related items represents net prior year loss reserve and premium development, and includes the effects of interest accretion and change in allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and deductible amounts.

Statutory capital and surplus represents the excess of an insurance company's admitted assets over its liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Statutory capital and surplus as of the current period is preliminary.

The Company's investment portfolio is monitored by management through analysis of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities, portfolio duration and exposure to market and credit risk.

Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures

Management utilizes financial measures not in accordance with GAAP to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio. The Company believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow below.

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Core Income (Loss)

Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of net investment gains or losses and gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions. Net investment gains or losses are excluded from the calculation of core income (loss) because they are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of our primary operations. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net investment gains or losses because net investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of our primary operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure.

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Underwriting Gain (Loss) and Underlying Underwriting Gain (Loss)

Underwriting gain (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated pretax as net earned premiums less total insurance expenses, which includes insurance claims and policyholders' benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and insurance related administrative expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate the profitability, before tax, derived from our underwriting activities which are managed separately from our investing activities.

Underlying underwriting gain (loss) is also deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and represents pretax underwriting results excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate the profitability, before tax, derived from our underwriting activities, excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year underwriting performance.

Reconciliation of Book Value per Share to Book Value per Share Excluding AOCI

Book value per share excluding AOCI allows management and investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes this measurement is useful as it reduces the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.
