(Updates prices.)

Gold traded at a record high mid-afternoon on Monday, pushing close to the US$3,000 per ounce mark as fresh tariff threats from the Trump Administration spur safe-haven buying.

Gold for April delivery was last seen up US$46.20 to US$2,933.80 per ounce, up from the Feb.5 record close of US$2,893.00.

The rise comes as U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday promised to impose 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. The tariffs will be added to a 10% tariff imposed on imports from China and continuing threats by Trump to impose 25% levies on imports from Canada and Mexico after last week he postponed them by 30 days. He is also threatening new tariffs on imports from the European Union.

The fresh levies are prompting safe-haven buying even as the U.S. dollar rises. The ICE dollar index was last seen up 0.23 points to 108.27.

Treasury yields were mixed. The U.S. two-year note was last seen paying 4.277%, down 2.5 basis points, while the yield on 10-year note was up 0.4 points to 4.45%.
