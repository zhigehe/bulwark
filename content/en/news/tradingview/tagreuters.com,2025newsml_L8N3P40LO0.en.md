\*\* Shares in Neste slump 12% after it posted core profit below expectations, hit by a decline in renewable fuel sales prices, operational challenges in its renewable refineries

\*\* The Finnish oil refiner and biofuel maker reports Q4 EBITDA of EUR 168 million ($175.12 million), missing the 308 million euros seen by analysts in a company-provided poll

\*\* "Another weak print, no easy fixes," RBC says, pointing to collapsed Renewable Products premiums

\*\* Jefferies notes Q4 EBITDA missed consensus driven by Renewable Products unit, while Neste's outlook for 2025 is cautious

\*\* Jefferies says that dividend cut to 0.2 euros per share from 1.2 euros "is higher than expected but should alleviate balance sheet concerns and is sustainable"

\*\* "We wonder whether this will be enough to bring investors back to the name given the continued macro challenges," RBC adds

\*\* Neste, heading for its worst day in 9 months, sits among worst performers on Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index

($1 = 0.9593 euros)
