BOLTON, Ontario, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Titanium Transportation Group Inc. ("Titanium" or the "Company") (TSX:TTNM, OTCQX:TTNMF), a leading provider of transportation and logistics services throughout North America, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has elected to suspend its dividend as the Company continues to execute a disciplined financial strategy amid ongoing market challenges.

“Given the current softness in our core markets and growing uncertainty surrounding potential tariff changes, we are adopting a proactive and disciplined approach to capital allocation,” commented Ted Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Titanium. “While we are seeing some early signs of economic stabilization, the overall outlook remains uncertain due to the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical situation, including potential trade barriers and tariffs. By temporarily suspending our dividend, we are ensuring that we have the financial resilience to navigate near-term headwinds, accelerate debt-reduction and fortify our balance sheet for long-term sustainable growth.”

The Company remains focused on executing against its strategic priorities and driving long-term shareholder value. Recognizing that Titanium has a strong track record of returning capital through consistent dividend payments, the Board will continue to review, among other things, the Company’s budget, cash flow forecast, growth opportunities and market conditions on a quarterly basis to determine whether dividends will be declared on shares for future quarters.
