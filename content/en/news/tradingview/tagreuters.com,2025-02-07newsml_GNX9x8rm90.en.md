PASCAGOULA, Miss., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division awarded $95,600 in STEM grants today to 22 local schools and educational organizations, reinforcing the company’s commitment to fostering innovation and critical thinking among youth. The grants will support a variety of hands-on projects, classroom technology enhancements, and STEM-focused curriculums.

“STEM education isn’t just about learning formulas or theories — it’s about hands-on experiences that inspire the next generation of critical thinkers,” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Brian Blanchette said. “As an engineer by trade, I know firsthand how important it is to have opportunities that spark curiosity and encourage problem-solving at a young age. At Ingalls, we are proud to invest in programs that can help us build a strong foundation for future engineers, shipbuilders and industry leaders.”

The annual STEM grant program is part of Ingalls Shipbuilding’s broader community outreach and workforce development efforts. It also provides educators with the opportunity to apply for funding up to $5,000 for a specific project that falls under one of the STEM categories — science, technology, engineering or mathematics.

HII is committed to shaping the future of engineering, science and technology and makes investments in STEM education programs through partnerships with local elementary, middle and high schools, community colleges and technical schools, summer internships, and industry-leading apprentice schools at the company’s two shipyards.

The Ingalls STEM awards attracted over 90 applications this grant cycle from across the region. The next application cycle will open in August 2025 at the beginning of the 2025-2026 academic school year and end in October.
