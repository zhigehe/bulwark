\*\* Shares in Vaar Energi rise 4.5% after the Norwegian oil and gas company proposed an increased dividend, announced an upbeat 2025 guidance

\*\* RBC notes that Vaar Energi's Q4 numbers were a tad lower than expected, but highlights the group's increased 25-30% long-term payout ratio and production forecast

\*\* Vaar Energi said it targets production of over 400 kboepd in Q4Â 2025 versus its earlier view of "about" 400 kboepd

\*\* DNB Markets sees the group's overall 2025 production guidance of 330-360 kboed as "ambitious" and expects raised capex guidance to weigh somewhat negatively

\*\* Still, it expects the shares to outperform, given their weakness into the report

\*\* Vaar Energi shares are among best performers on STOXX 600 index
