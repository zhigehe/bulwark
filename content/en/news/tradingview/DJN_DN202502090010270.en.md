Oil edges higher in the early Asian session. Last week, the U.S. imposed sanctions on an international network facilitating the shipment of Iranian crude to China to increase pressure on the Middle Eastern country. The sanctions could offer short-term support by limiting Iranian oil availability, says Hamza Zraimek, CEO of IGOUDAR in an email. However, broader worries over global supply and demand dynamics continue, Zraimek adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 0.3% at $71.19/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are 0.25% higher at $74.85/bbl. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
