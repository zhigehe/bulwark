The dollar trades steady ahead of a testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later. Powell is expected to sound cautious about cutting interest rates, though there's mounting pressure from President Trump to lower rates, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. U.S. growth remains solid, the jobs market healthy, and inflation sticky, she says. Trump's growth-boosting policies and tariff threats could also increase inflation, she says. A cautious stance from Powell would potentially boost the dollar. Powell speaks before the Senate Banking Committee at 1500 GMT. He will then address the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday. The DXY dollar index trades flat at 108.356. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
