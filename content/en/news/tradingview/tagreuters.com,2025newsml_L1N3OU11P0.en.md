U.S. central bankers paused interest-rate cuts at their January 28-29 meeting, noting bumpy progress toward their 2% inflation goal, a still-strong labor market, and a lot of uncertainty over tariffs, tax cuts, and other economic policies under President Donald Trump.

Here is a look at their comments since then, sorting them under the labels "dove" and "hawk" as shorthand for their [monetary policy leanings](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/FED/lgpdwawwzvo/). A dove is more focused on risks to the labor market and may want to cut rates more quickly, while a hawk is more focused on the threat of inflation and may be more cautious about rate cuts.

The designations are based on comments and published remarks; for more, click on the photos in [this graphic](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/FED/lgpdwawwzvo/). For a breakdown of how Reuters' counts in each category have changed, please scroll to the bottom of this story.

|  | Austan Goolsbee, Chicago Fed President, 2025 voter: "I think we're on path back to 2% on the inflation side…And as that inflation comes down, we can commensurately be cutting the interest rate." Feb 7, 2025 | Philip Jefferson, Vice Chair, permanent voter: “We can be patient and wait to see the net effect of any policy changes by the current administration.” Feb 5, 2025 | Alberto Musalem, St. Louis Fed President, 2025 voter: No public comments on monetary policy since Jan 2025. |  |

Feb 7, 2025 | Lorie Logan, Dallas Fed President, 2026 voter: “If inflation comes in close to 2% in coming months…it wouldn’t necessarily allow the FOMC to cut rates soon.” Feb 6, 2025 |  |
|  |  | Susan Collins, Boston Fed President, 2025 voter: "It's really appropriate for policy to be patient, careful, and there's no urgency for making additional adjustments." Feb 3, 2025 | Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Fed President, 2026 voter: "We're in a very good place to just sit here until we get a lot more information on the tariff front, on the immigration front, on the tax front, etc.” Feb 7, 2025 |  |

Notes: The current policy rate target range is 4.25%-4.50%. As of December, Fed policymakers projected half of a percentage point of rate cuts this year, less than in 2024; they next publish projections at their March 18-19 meeting.

The seven Fed governors, including the Fed chief and vice chairs, have permanent votes at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, which are held eight times a year. All 12 regional Fed presidents discuss and debate monetary policy at the meetings, but only five cast votes, including the New York Fed president and four others who vote for one year at a time on a rotating schedule.

Reuters over time has shifted policymaker designations based on fresh comments and developing circumstances. Below is a Reuters count of policymakers in each category, heading into recent Fed meetings.
