\*\* Shares of the New York-based drug developer IN8bio rises 17.5% to 31 cents

\*\* Co [says](https://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250211:nGNX3Gzd28&default-theme=true) early-stage trial showed its experimental cancer therapy helped all 9 patients with a type of blood cancer remain in complete remission

\*\* Co's therapy, INB-100, also helped increase survival rates of patients compared to historical data and the time they lived without their cancer worsening

\*\* INAB was testing its therapy to treat acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow

\*\* INB-100 uses gamma-delta T cells, that are rarely found in secondary lymphoid organs and play a role in helping control cancer activity, to target the disease

\*\* Patients treated with INB-100 also showed prolonged and durable decrease in symptoms of their cancer beyond one year

\*\* In the last 12 months, INAB has fallen 70.27%
