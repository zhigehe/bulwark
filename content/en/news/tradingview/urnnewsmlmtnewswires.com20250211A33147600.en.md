Financial stocks were advancing in Tuesday afternoon trading, with the NYSE Financial Index adding 0.1% and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) fractionally higher.

The Philadelphia Housing Index was up 0.1%, and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE) rose 0.2%.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) was falling 1.5% to $95,842, and the yield for 10-year US Treasuries was rising 3 basis points to 4.53%.

In corporate news, Fidelity National Information Services' Q4 revenue missed the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet, and its outlook for sales for Q1 and full year 2025 also lagged market expectations. Its shares dropped more than 12%.

S&P Global shares rose 3.4% after it reported higher Q4 adjusted earnings and revenue.

Goldman Sachs is open to acquisitions in asset and wealth management, but would be selective in its approach to any potential deals, Chief Executive David Solomon said Tuesday, according to Reuters. Goldman shares were shedding 0.6%.
