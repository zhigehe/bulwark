Consumers deliver a split take on the labor market in the New York Fed's latest survey. Earnings growth expectations over the next year increase slightly to 3%--but this number has held relatively steady for the past 12 months in the survey. Expectations that unemployment will rise over the next year decline by 0.6 percentage points to 34%, showing optimism. On the other hand, the mean perceived probability of losing one's job over the next year increases by 2.3 percentage points, to 14.2%, a more downbeat result. But finally, there was also an increase in the perceived probability of finding a new job in the next three months if one lost one's current job. That figure rises by 1.3 percentage points to 51.5%.(matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)
