Talabat Holding's upcoming fourth-quarter results will likely be good, ING analyst Marc Hesselink says. The Dutch bank expects Delivery Hero's Middle East subsidiary to deliver revenue and Ebitda slightly above consensus. "The key point is to see if the strong growth and profitability trends of nine month of 2024 continued into the fourth quarter," Hesselink adds. Additionally, the company will probably reiterate its 2025 guidance, which includes continued high growth and margin improvement, he says. Shares are up 0.7% at 1.42 United Arab Emirates dirham.
