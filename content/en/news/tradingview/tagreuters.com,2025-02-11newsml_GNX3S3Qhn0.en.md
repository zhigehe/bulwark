Lisa Opoku, currently the Chief Operating Officer at FS Investments, brings over two decades of leadership experience in global financial services. Prior to joining FS Investments, Opoku held several senior leadership positions at Goldman Sachs, including Global Head of the Goldman Sachs Partner Family Office within Asset and Wealth Management.
