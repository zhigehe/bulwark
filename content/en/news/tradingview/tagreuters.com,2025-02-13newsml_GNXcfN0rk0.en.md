LUZERN, Switzerland, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Profila is revolutionizing the advertising industry by eliminating data-harvesting middlemen and redirecting ad revenues straight to users. With its Web3-powered platform, Profila compensates individuals for their data and attention, offering up to 80% of ad spend in its native ZEKE token. The groundbreaking ZEKE token sale is now live.

For years, surveillance-driven tech giants and ad intermediaries have exploited user data, accumulating billions while delivering questionable engagement and widespread ad fraud. Profila’s model disrupts this outdated system by enabling direct brand-to-user advertising, ensuring transparency, fairness, and real engagement.

**Why ZEKE is a game-changer**

* Massive buy pressure – Brands fuel the system, while users cash out in ZEKE.
* Next-generation privacy – No tracking, no exploitation—just ethical, user-driven engagement.
* Web3 security – Built on Cardano for enhanced security, fairness, and transparency.
* Big tech disruption – Eliminates intrusive ads and manipulative algorithms.
* Limited-time rewards – Up to 200,000 ADA in ZEKE bonuses available.

“This isn’t just another token launch—it’s a reckoning for the entire ad industry,” said Shawn Jensen, CEO of Profila. “Users should be the ones benefiting from their data, not tech giants profiting behind their backs.”
