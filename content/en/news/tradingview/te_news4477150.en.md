The New Zealand dollar steadied around $0.564 on Thursday as traders assessed the RBNZ's latest monetary conditions survey, which presented a mixed outlook for Q1 2025.

New Zealand’s two-year inflation expectations fell to 2.06% in Q1 from 2.12% in Q4 2024, but one-year expectations rose to 2.15% from 2.05%.

Investors continued to speculate on further RBNZ rate cuts ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting next week, following three cuts last year that lowered borrowing costs to 4.25%.

Meanwhile, the Kiwi dollar came under pressure on Wednesday after hot US inflation data reinforced expectations of prolonged Fed rate holds, weighing on G10 currencies.

Nevertheless, speculation about a possible pause in the Russia-Ukraine war lifted risk sentiment, helping offset some losses for the antipodean currency.

Markets continued to monitor growth risks from Trump’s new tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese imports, with the latter impacting the Kiwi dollar.
