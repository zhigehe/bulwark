Lucara Diamond , which fell 4% on Tuesday, announced overnight the successful sale of the 549 carat Sethunya diamond and the 1,080 carat Eva Star diamond from its Karowe Mine in Botswana.

The company sold the diamonds for US$54 million and recognized US$44 million in revenue net of fees, excluding royalties.

"The sale of these two extraordinary diamonds further validates our investment in the Karowe underground project," said Lucara Chief Executive William Lamb. "The unique characteristics of Karowe's kimberlite, particularly in the South Lobe, continue to amaze us with its ability to produce diamonds of exceptional size and quality. The mineralogy we're seeing is truly unprecedented in the industry, consistently delivering Type IIa diamonds of remarkable clarity and size."

Shares of the company closed down $0.015 to $0.345 on Tuesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
