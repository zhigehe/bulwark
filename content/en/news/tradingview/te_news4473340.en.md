Tin futures jumped to above $31,000 per tonne in February, the highest in three months, amid the continuous threat of uncertain supply.

Reports from the International Tin Association indicated that export permits from Indonesia are expected to be delayed following bureaucratic breaks in the Lunar New Year, extending similar trends from the previous year.

Additionally, reports indicated that Myanmar’s Man Maw mine has not yet been reinstated amid political conflicts in the major tin producer.

Lower output from Myanmar’s Wa State in recent years has pressured the availability of ore for Chinese smelters, which continued to report tight conditions of feedstock availability at the turn of the year.

In the meantime, the outlook for Chinese manufacturing demand remained mixed, as markets digested the poor manufacturing PMIs against Beijing's pledge of aggressive fiscal stimulus this year.
