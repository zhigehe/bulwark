President Donald Trump's recent announcement of a full-time, five-day-a-week return-to-office mandate for federal employees has sparked heated debates. Framed as a strategy to reduce the size of the federal workforce and boost efficiency, the decision overlooks a critical consequence: It may result in the loss of the government's most experienced and skilled employees.

If history is any indication, this sweeping policy could usher in a new wave of resignations that would undermine the very efficiency it seeks to enhance.

President Joe Biden issued a more moderate RTO mandate just two years ago, intended to increase the time federal staff worked in the office. That order triggered a substantial increase in turnover rates among senior and skilled employees. A groundbreaking study conducted by Mark Ma and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, using data from Revelio Labs, provides clear evidence of the damage caused by Biden's RTO announcement. The study also offers critical insights into the repercussions of Trump's far more stringent policy.

In March 2022, Biden urged the "vast majority" of federal employees to return to their offices at least 60% of the time as pandemic conditions improved. This hybrid RTO policy was less demanding than Trump's full-time directive, but still caused significant disruption. Turnover rates among senior employees — those ranked as directors, supervisors, or higher — spiked by 26% following the announcement. These individuals, equipped with decades of institutional knowledge and leadership expertise, found themselves more likely to exit federal employment for opportunities in the private sector, where remote work flexibility remains a highly valued norm.

Similarly, the impact on highly skilled employees was profound. Those with advanced qualifications and specialized abilities experienced a 32% increase in turnover. These individuals, who often possess sought-after skills in technology, science, and management, represent the intellectual and operational core of federal agencies. Their departure has left many departments struggling to maintain efficiency and continuity in their operations.

The data consistently pointed to a troubling reality at federal agencies including Defense, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security: Employees with the most to contribute to the public sector were the most likely to leave when faced with an inflexible return-to-office policy.

Other authoritative sources found similar results. The Government Accountability Office, in a November 2024 report, evaluated telework policies at four federal agencies: the Farm Service Agency, the IRS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Veterans Benefits Administration. The findings are illuminating.

Agencies with robust telework policies, such as VBA, which reported telework at 66% of total hours worked, experienced significant advantages. Telework helped broaden the IRS's talent pool, enabling the agency to attract customer service representatives from regions far beyond its physical office locations. Similarly, USCIS reported a significant boost in applicant interest for positions offering telework, demonstrating its appeal to prospective employees.

The Farm Service Agency, by contrast, offered minimal telework opportunities. Only 11% of hours were teleworked. That agency faced pronounced recruitment and retention difficulties. FSA officials attributed these challenges, in part, to restricted telework availability. While compensation and workload pressures were also cited as factors, the lack of flexibility in telework options emerged as a clear deterrent to attracting and retaining top talent.

Further support for telework as a retention and productivity tool comes from the Office of Personnel Management. In a 2023 report, OPM found that 72% of federal supervisors believe telework has either maintained or improved employee productivity. Additionally, 84% of federal employees with telework opportunities reported higher job satisfaction, citing improved work-life balance as a primary factor. The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey further confirmed these trends, with 78% of respondents agreeing that telework positively contributes to their work-life integration.

The broader implications of these findings are clear. When federal agencies offer flexible work options, they strengthen their ability to attract and retain talent while maintaining productivity. Conversely, mandating a full-time return to the office, as Trump's policy proposes, is likely to reverse these gains.

Trump's full-time RTO mandate is poised to accelerate government brain drain. Senior employees, who are already disproportionately required to work in-office, are likely to leave in droves. These individuals often have extensive professional networks and the financial stability to transition to private-sector roles that offer remote or hybrid work arrangements. Skilled employees are presented with an even starker choice: abandon the flexibility they value or abandon their federal careers.

The consequences of this talent loss will reverberate beyond individual agencies. Federal departments rely on their senior and skilled workforce to navigate complex challenges, implement policies, and deliver services efficiently. Losing these employees en masse risks not only operational disruption but also a decline in public trust, as citizens experience delays and inefficiencies in essential services.

Trump's mandate may aim to reduce the federal workforce. But its implementation gets rid of the wrong staff: the most skilled and experienced ones, instead of underperformers, who would have more difficulty finding jobs elsewhere. This approach risks creating a crisis that will cost far more than it saves.
