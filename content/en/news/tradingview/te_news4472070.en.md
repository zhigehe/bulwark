Total US consumer credit surged by $40.85 billion in December 2024, far exceeding the forecasted $12.35 billion and marking the largest increase in history.

This sharp rise followed a revised $5.37 billion decline in November, signaling a significant rebound in consumer borrowing.

Revolving credit, which includes credit cards and personal lines of credit, jumped by $22.9 billion, recovering from November’s $13.8 billion decline but still reflecting volatility in short-term borrowing.

Meanwhile, nonrevolving credit, which covers auto loans and student debt, increased by $18.0 billion, building on November’s already strong $8.5 billion gain.

The +2.4% year-over-year growth in consumer credit suggests a continued but measured expansion in borrowing activity.

This sharp increase in credit usage could indicate renewed consumer confidence, though it may also raise concerns about rising debt levels in the coming months.
