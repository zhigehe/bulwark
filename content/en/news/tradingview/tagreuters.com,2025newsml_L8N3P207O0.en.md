Europe's largest travel operator TUI reported a jump in its first-quarter profit on Tuesday, driven by strong performance in its packaged holiday business.

While European airlines faced struggles last year, travel companies such as TUI benefited from the resurgence of packaged holidays.

Holidaymakers are increasingly turning to package holidays as soaring hotel and flight prices revive demand for all-inclusive deals.

Shares of TUI have climbed 45% since last September following a trading update.

"People prioritise their holidays even in times of change, and even in a challenging economic environment in Europe for almost all sectors," TUI Group CEO Sebastian Ebel said on Tuesday.

TUI confirmed its 2025 outlook and posted quarterly underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 51 million euros ($52.55 million), up from 6 million euros in year-ago period.

While travel demand has remained robust, TUI, like other European airline businesses, has been affected by Boeing delivery delays and high costs.

At the end of last year, the company forecast 2025 EBIT growth to ease to between 7% and 10% due to one-off costs.

($1 = 0.9706 euros)
