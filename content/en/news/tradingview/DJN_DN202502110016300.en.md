BYD's AI-driven smart-driving technology is positive for companies in its supply chain, Citi analysts say in a research note. The analysts see upside of at least 3%-5% to component maker BYD Electronic's auto-business revenue over 2025 and 2026, the analysts say. However, the recent rally for BYD and its related stocks may have already priced in most of the impact, they add. Citi sees Will Semiconductor, Sunny Optical Technology and BYD Electronic as major beneficiaries from the advanced driver assistance system theme, given the big contribution in revenue and profit from the auto business.
