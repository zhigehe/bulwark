There was some (slim?) hope last week that the US and China would negotiate a way to avoid tariffs when there were reports about a phone call between the two. That call was evidently called off, though there is still hope the call will occur.

The US additional tariff on China went into effect last week, though some of the de minimis exemption was later delayed. China's tariff went into effect at midnight local time (it's now nearly 8 am in China).

It targeted American exports such as liquefied natural gas, coal, crude oil, farm equipment, and certain automotive goods with tariffs ranging from 10% to 15%.
