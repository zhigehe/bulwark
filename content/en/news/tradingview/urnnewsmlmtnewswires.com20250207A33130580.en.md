US equity indexes fell this week as rising inflation expectations and nonfarm payroll revisions compounded the hit to sentiment from mega-cap technology earnings and upcoming reciprocal punitive tariffs.

\* The S&P 500 closed at 6,025.99 on Friday, versus 6,040.53 a week earlier, and the Nasdaq Composite stood at 19,523.40 compared with 19,627.44 a week prior. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 44,303.40 versus 44,544.66 a week ago.

\* The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 67.8 in February from 71.1 in January, below expectations for an increase to 71.8. Respondents saw one-year inflation expectations surge to 4.3%, the highest since November 2023, from 3.3% in January. Five-year inflation expectations rose to 3.3% from 3.2% the month prior, the highest since 2008 according to data compiled by Trading Economics.

\* Nonfarm payrolls rose by 143,000 in January, missing the 175,000 consensus. But, December's gain was revised higher by 51,000 to 307,000, and a November revision added 49,000. Wildfires in Southern California and severe winter weather had "no discernible effect" on jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

\* Amazon.com reported higher Q4 earnings and net sales, but its Q1 sales guidance lagged analyst expectations. Alphabet's Q4 revenue trailed estimates while Advanced Micro Devices reported weaker-than-expected data center sales for Q4 and guided to a sequential drop in Q1 sales. Shares of Apple (APPL), Alphabet, Tesla , and Amazon were among the 10 worst performers out of the mega-caps this week.

\* President Donald Trump said Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs next week, Reuters reported. "I'll be announcing that next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said.
