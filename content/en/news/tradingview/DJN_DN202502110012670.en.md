BYD's introduction of its driving assistance system--God's Eye--is marginally positive for the company and could help sustain its high market share, Jefferies analysts write in a note. The Chinese automaker plans to roll out the technology for its models in all price ranges, they note. The move will likely accelerate the adoption rate of assisted driving function in the mass market and lead to a wave of upgrades by existing users, they say. Jefferies maintains its buy rating for the stock. Shares last at HK$330.00. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
