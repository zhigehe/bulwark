VOXX International reported late Friday its fiscal Q3 swung to a loss of $1.90 per diluted share from earnings of $0.08 per share a year earlier.

Net sales in the quarter ended Nov. 30 fell to $105.2 million from $135.3 million a year earlier.

Comparable analysts' estimates were not available on FactSet.

The company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act regarding the proposed Gentex transaction expired on Feb. 3 and the German Federal Cartel Office cleared the proposed merger in late January.
