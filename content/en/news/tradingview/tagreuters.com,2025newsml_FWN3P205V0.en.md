GOLDMAN SACHS:

* FORECASTS THAT US MIDWEST ALUMINIUM PREMIUM WILL RISE TO 50C/LB ($1,036/T), FROM AN AVERAGE OF 24C/LB($529/T) IN JANUARY 2025
* EXPECTS US DOMESTIC STEEL PRICES TO RISE TO REFLECT THE FULL 25% INCREASE IN THE DUTY PAID ON IMPORTS
* SAYS THEIR BASELINE FORECAST INCLUDES A 70% PROBABILITY OF A 10% US TARIFF ON COPPER IMPORTS BY THE END OF 2025
* EXPECTS LATEST TARIFF INCREASE TO LIFT US MIDWEST PREMIUM BY AROUND $440/T OR 20C/LB TO 50C/LB FOR ALUMINIUM
* SAYS 10% TARIFF ON US COPPER IMPORTS WILL NOT HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE LME COPPER PRICE
* THINKS A 25% TARIFF ON COPPER WOULD WEIGH ON US COPPER DEMAND (INCLUDING STRONGER SWITCHING INTO ALUMINIUM) AND WOULD LIKELY FACE INDUSTRY PUSH-BACK
