Glaston Corporation  STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE         14 February 2025  8:45 EET

The Board of Directors of Glaston Corporation has resolved on the share-based incentive plan 2025−2029 for the Group key employees in accordance with the terms and conditions materially corresponding to the terms and conditions of the share-based incentive plan 2019−2023.

The aim of the incentive plan is to align the objectives of the shareholders and the key employees in order to increase the value of the company in the long term, to retain the key employees at the company, and to offer them a competitive incentive plan that is based on earning and accumulating the company’s shares.

The share-based incentive plan 2025−2029 comprises three performance periods, calendar years 2025−2027, 2026−2028, and 2027−2029. The Board of Directors resolves on the plan’s performance criteria and on the performance levels at the beginning of each performance period. The key employees will receive the company’s shares as a reward, if the performance levels of the performance criteria, set by the Board of Directors, are achieved. As a general rule, no reward will be paid, if a key employee’s employment or service terminates before the reward payment.

The CEO and President and each member of the Executive Leadership Team of the company must hold 50% of the net number of shares he or she has received on the basis of the plan until the number of the company’s shares he or she holds corresponds to the value of his or her gross annual base salary. Such number of shares must be held as long as such person’s employment or service in a company belonging to the Group Company continues.

**Performance Period 2025−2027**

The potential reward of the performance period 2025−2027 will be based on the Glaston Group’s Cumulative comparable EBITA, cumulative Service Net Sales and annual Earnings per Share, EPS during the period of 1 January 2025−31 December 2027. If the performance levels of the performance criteria for the performance period 2025−2027 are achieved in full, the payable rewards correspond to a maximum total of 796,000 Glaston Corporation shares, including also the proportion to be paid in cash.

The potential reward from the performance period 2025−2027 will be paid in 2028 in a manner resolved by the Board of Directors, either partly in the company’s shares and partly in cash, in which case the cash proportion is intended to cover taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward to the key employee, or fully in cash.

The reward to be paid on the basis of the plan may be reduced if the reward cap set by the Board of Directors is reached.

In total 14 key persons, including the company’s key executive leaders, belong to the target group of the plan in the performance period 2025–2027.
