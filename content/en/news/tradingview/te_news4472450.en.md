The Australian dollar weakened below $0.625 on Monday, marking its third consecutive session of losses as US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on metal imports dampened global sentiment.

Trump announced a blanket 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, effective later today, along with additional tariffs to be revealed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

In retaliation, China is reportedly planning to target US technology firms such as Broadcom and Synopsis with an investigation.

In Australia, investors are focusing on upcoming consumer and business confidence data on Tuesday for insights into the strength of the economy.

Markets are also anticipating a potential rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia this month, amid easing domestic inflation and slowing economic activity.
