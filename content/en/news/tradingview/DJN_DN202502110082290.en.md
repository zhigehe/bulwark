The USDA keeps its estimate of 2024-25 U.S. cotton production unchanged at 14.41 million bales in its February WASDE report. U.S. beginning stocks and exports are also unchanged, while average upland farm price projection is reduced to 63.5 from 65 cents a pound. U.S. ending stocks projection is raised slightly to 4.9 million bales from 4.8 million bales. The global output forecast is raised to 120.46 million bales from 119.45 million bales, with ending stocks of 78.41 million bales, up from 77.91 million bales estimated last month. Cotton futures are up 1.4%, on the CBOT, losing some steam after the report. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
