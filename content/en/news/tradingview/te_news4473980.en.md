The South Korean won weakened past 1,450 per dollar, giving back gains from the previous session, as the US dollar strengthened following US President Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.

Trump also revealed plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries, raising fears of a global trade war that could stoke inflation and limit further Fed rate cuts.

Additionally, he said Monday he was considering tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceuticals, key South Korean exports, adding further pressure on the won.

Meanwhile, South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok convened a meeting to discuss responses to Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, while the industry ministry held an emergency meeting with steel companies.

On the monetary policy front, BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong cautioned last Thursday that the widely anticipated rate cut later this month is not a "done deal."
