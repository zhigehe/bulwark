Austal's Austal Australasia unit received a contract valued between AU$265 and AU$275 million from Swedish company Gotlandsbolaget to design and build a 130-meter "hydrogen-ready" passenger ferry, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

The ferry will feature a combined gas and steam turbine propulsion system to carry 1,500 passengers, cargo, and 400 vehicles, per the filing.

The ferry will be built at Austal Philippines starting in the first half of the calendar year 2026 using low-emission "green aluminum," with completion set for mid-2028, the filing added.

Company shares were down past 1% in recent Thursday trade.
