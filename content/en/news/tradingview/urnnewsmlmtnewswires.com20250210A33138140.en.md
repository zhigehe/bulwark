UBS is keeping its Neutral rating and US$10 target on Canada Goose after the company's third-quarter results.

Canada Goose's third-quarter result and fourth-quarter guidance reinforce UBS's view the brand is losing momentum with consumers.

Tariffs are another key 2025 unknown as 70% of GOOS' units are manufactured in Canada, and U.S. sales represent approximately 24% of overall revenue. "This puts GOOS in a difficult position if a 25% tariff is established on all Canadian-produced goods exported into the U.S.," UBS noted.

The company did not say what the impact of a new tariff may be, but stated it is looking into tactics to potentially mitigate the impact.
