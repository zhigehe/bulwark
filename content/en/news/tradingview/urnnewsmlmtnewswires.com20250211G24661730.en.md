Chinese shares fell marginally in the negative territory on Tuesday as the US tariffs continue to weigh on the domestic market.

The Shanghai Composite Index, the main gauge of Chinese stocks, slid marginally by 4.11 points to 3,318.06. The Shenzhen Component Index also fell to 0.7%, or 73.62 points, to end Tuesday's trade at 10,557.62.

US President Donald Trump plans to introduce 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which could affect not only China, but Mexico and Canada, as well.

The pre-announcement came after China introduced retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including 15% duties on coal and liquefied natural gas or LNG. The new tariffs were made in response to the previously introduced 10% levy on Chinese imports to the US.

In corporate news, Beijing Aosaikang Pharmaceutical fell nearly 4%, as the Chinese drug administration accepted the pharmaceutical company's unit's marketing application for isavuconazole sulfate capsules.
