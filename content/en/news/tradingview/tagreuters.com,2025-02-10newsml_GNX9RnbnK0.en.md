WARREN, N.J., Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Tevogen Bio (“Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc.” or “Company”) (Nasdaq: TVGN), is a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy biotech company. As the biopharma industry faces increasing competition from international markets and an evolving regulatory landscape, Tevogen Bio’s innovative business model positions it as a potential leader in the shift towards cost-efficient, value-driven healthcare.

With the concern of Chinese pharmaceutical companies developing drugs at a faster pace and lower cost, the U.S. biotech sector faces pressure to adapt. At the same time, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is soon to helm the Department of Health and Human Services, has prioritized affordable healthcare, prompting industry-wide discussions on sustainability and access. Built with these industry themes in mind, Tevogen Bio exemplifies how American biotech can remain competitive and thrive amid growing concerns surrounding affordability, efficiency, and global competition.

“Our business model was designed to address the very concerns the industry is facing today—delivering groundbreaking medical innovations while ensuring affordability and sustainability,” said Ryan Saadi, MD, MPH, Founder and CEO of Tevogen Bio. “This is not a reactionary approach; we built Tevogen Bio with the explicit mission of redefining healthcare economics, and today, we are demonstrating that this vision is both necessary and achievable.”
