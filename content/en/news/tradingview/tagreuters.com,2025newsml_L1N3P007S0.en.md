DBS Group , Singapore's biggest bank, posted a 10% rise in net profit in the fourth quarter from a year earlier on the back of growth in both commercial book and markets trading, according to stock exchange filing on Monday.

DBS, the first Singapore lender to kick-start this earnings season, said October-December net profit climbed to S$2.62 billion ($1.93 billion) from S$2.39 billion a year earlier.

This matched the mean estimate of nearly S$2.63 billion from five analysts, according to LSEG data.
