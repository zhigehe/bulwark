Ward Nye, Chair and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “In 2024, we faced several challenging dynamics beyond our control, including inclement weather, softening construction demand in both nonresidential and residential sectors, and tighter-than-expected monetary policy. Despite these headwinds, we remained steadfast in executing our strategic priorities and concluded the year with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, resulting in record fourth quarter profits.

”The Company delivered our safest year on record, achieved nearly double-digit growth in unit margins, expanded Adjusted EBITDA margins and reshaped our portfolio. This was accomplished through approximately $6 billion in aggregates-led acquisitions and non-core asset divestitures. These portfolio-optimizing transactions created a more durable business, increased the gross profit contribution from our core aggregates product line, and enhanced our margin profile, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet for continued acquisitive growth.

"Looking ahead, the strategic actions we completed in 2024, combined with strong infrastructure and data center demand, should more than offset ongoing softness in residential construction demand. Consequently, we are confident in achieving the midpoint of our 2025 full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.25 billion, a 9% improvement compared to the prior year."

Mr. Nye concluded, "Our long history of successfully identifying, executing and integrating operations into our business, while managing controllable factors and navigating economic cycles, gives us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading safety, operational and financial performance. Martin Marietta's dedicated employees remain committed stewards of our shareholders' investment, working together to build and maintain the safest, best-performing, aggregates-led public company. We are positioned to generate sustainable earnings growth and superior shareholder value for years to come."

**Fourth-Quarter Financial and Operating Results**

(All financial and operating results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted)

**Building Materials Business**

The Building Materials business achieved revenues of $1.6 billion and gross profit of $472 million, both fourth-quarter records.

***Aggregates*** 

Fourth-quarter aggregates shipments increased 2.7 percent to 47.9 million tons, reflecting acquisition contributions that were partially offset by softer residential, warehouse and manufacturing demand. Average selling price (ASP) increased 8.6 percent to $21.95 per ton, or 7.6 percent on an organic mix-adjusted basis.

Aggregates gross profit increased 16 percent to $379 million due to contributions from acquired operations, organic pricing growth and lower diesel costs. Aggregates gross profit per ton increased 12 percent to $7.92 and gross margin improved 120 basis points to 33 percent, both fourth-quarter records.

***Cement and Downstream Businesses***

Cement and ready mixed concrete revenues decreased 24 percent to $261 million and gross profit decreased 36 percent to $68 million primarily due to the February 2024 divestiture of the South Texas cement plant and certain of its related ready mixed concrete operations.

Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 2 percent to $223 million, driven by slower market demand. Gross profit decreased 7 percent to $25 million due to lower revenues and higher aggregates costs partially offset by lower liquid asphalt costs.

**Magnesia Specialties Business**

Magnesia Specialties delivered revenues of $77 million, a fourth-quarter record, as strong lime and chemicals pricing more than offset lower shipments; gross profit decreased 3 percent to $22 million from unfavorable cost absorption on reduced production and higher supplies expense.

**Portfolio Optimization**

During the fourth quarter, the Company acquired aggregates-led, bolt-on assets in Southwest Florida, Southern California and West Texas.

**Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and Liquidity**

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion for both the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was $685 million, an increase of 23 percent compared with the prior-year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and deferred income tax payments due to disaster tax relief for North Carolina businesses affected by Hurricanes Debby and Helene.

Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $855 million, which included the purchase of aggregates reserves, land and processing plants in Southern California.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company returned $639 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, 11.9 million shares remained under the current repurchase authorization.

The Company had $670 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2024.

Fourth-quarter and full-year results and trends described in this release may not necessarily be indicative of the Company’s future performance. The Company’s outlook is subject to various risks and uncertainties and is based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable, but which may be materially different from actual results. Factors that the Company currently believes could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this release (including the outlook and 2025 Guidance) include, but are not limited to: the ability of the Company to face challenges, including shipment declines resulting from economic and weather events beyond the Company’s control; a widespread decline in aggregates pricing, including a decline in aggregates shipment volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the history of both cement and ready mixed concrete being subject to significant changes in supply, demand and price fluctuations; the termination, capping and/or reduction or suspension of the federal and/or state fuel tax(es) or other revenue related to public construction; the impact of the new Administration on the amount available under and timing of federal and state infrastructure spending; the level and timing of federal, state or local transportation or infrastructure or public projects funding and any issues arising from such federal and state budgets, most particularly in Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, California, Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, Arizona, South Carolina and Iowa; the United States Congress' inability to reach agreement among themselves or with the Executive Branch on policy issues that impact the federal budget; the ability of states and/or other entities to finance approved projects either with tax revenues or alternative financing structures; levels of construction spending in the markets the Company serves; a reduction in defense spending and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns or capital spending in response to such a decline, particularly in Texas and West Virginia; sustained high mortgage rates and other factors that have resulted in a slowdown in private construction in some geographies; unfavorable weather conditions, particularly Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico storm and hurricane activity, wildfires, the late start to spring or the early onset of winter and the impact of a drought, excessive rainfall or extreme temperatures in the markets served by the Company, any of which can significantly affect production schedules, volumes, product and/or geographic mix and profitability; the volatility of fuel costs and energy, particularly diesel fuel, electricity, natural gas and the impact on the cost, or the availability generally, of other consumables, namely steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts, and with respect to the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business, natural gas; continued increases in the cost of other repair and supply parts; construction labor shortages and/or supply‐chain challenges; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to production facilities; the resiliency and potential declines of the Company’s various construction end-use markets; the potential negative impacts of outbreak of disease, epidemic or pandemic, or similar public health threat, or fear of such event, and its related economic or societal response, including any impact on the Company's suppliers, customers or other business partners as well as on its employees; the performance of the United States economy; governmental regulation, including environmental laws and climate change regulations including at the state levels; transportation availability or a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads, notably the availability of railcars, locomotive power and the condition of rail infrastructure to move trains to supply the Company’s Texas, Southeast and Gulf Coast markets, including the movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan and its customers; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher or fluctuating passed-through energy costs or fuel surcharges, and other costs to comply with tightening regulations, as well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability of trucks and licensed drivers for transport of the Company’s materials; availability and cost of construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry markets served by the Company’s dolomitic lime products; potential impact on costs, supply chain, oil and gas prices, or other matters relating to the war between Russia and Ukraine, the war in Israel and related conflict in the Middle East and the conflict between China and Taiwan; trade disputes with one or more nations impacting the U.S. economy, including the impact of tariffs on the steel industry; unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers that introduce volatility to earnings, including that of the Magnesia Specialties business; proper functioning of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support operations; inflation and its effect on both production and interest costs; the concentration of customers in construction markets and the increased risk of potential losses on customer receivables; the impact of the level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and management of production costs on the operating leverage and therefore profitability of the Company; the possibility that the expected synergies from acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the Company’s leverage ratio debt covenant; the strategic benefits, outlook, performance and opportunities expected as a result of acquisitions and portfolio optimization will not be realized; changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices, including acquisitions or divestitures, that would increase the Company’s tax rate; violation of the Company’s debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous levels of instability; cybersecurity risks; downward pressure on the Company’s common stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations; the possibility of a reduction of the Company’s credit rating to non-investment grade; and other risk factors listed from time to time found in the Company’s filings with the SEC.

All of the Company’s forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** 

Earnings from continuing operations before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates; acquisition, divestiture and integration expenses and the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting subject to the limitations described below; nonrecurring gain on divestiture; and noncash asset and portfolio rationalization charge (Adjusted EBITDA) is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period. Effective January 1, 2024, transaction expenses and inventory acquisition accounting impacts are only excluded for transactions with at least $2 billion in consideration and transaction expenses expected to exceed $15 million. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to earnings from operations, net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta or operating cash flow. For further information on Adjusted EBITDA, refer to the Company’s website at www.martinmarietta.com.

Reconciliation of Average Selling Price to Mix-Adjusted Average Selling Price

Mix-adjusted average selling price (mix-adjusted ASP) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of period-over-period product, geographic and other mix on the average selling price. Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period. Management uses this metric to evaluate the realization of pricing changes and believes this information is useful to investors. The following reconciles reported average selling price to mix-adjusted ASP and corresponding variances.
