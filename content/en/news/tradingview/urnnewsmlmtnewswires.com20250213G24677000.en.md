Hamelin Gold said surface soil sampling through the Ultrafine analytical technology defined a discrete gold anomaly at the Ularring project in Western Australia, according to a Friday filing with the Australian bourse.

The anomaly extends over 500 meters in strike, with a single sample from a sub-cropping quartz vein nearby yielding an assay of 7.9 grams per tonne grade of gold, the filing said.

A 2,500-meter air-core drill program will be completed across the main gold anomaly starting in March, according to the filing.

Shares were up 15% in midday trade Friday.
