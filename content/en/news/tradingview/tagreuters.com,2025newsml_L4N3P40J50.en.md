Asia's refining margin for gasoline held steady near $10 per barrel on Thursday, with declines limited by recent support from western markets as well as upcoming regional planned maintenances.

The crack for the motor fuel (GL92-SIN-CRK) rose slightly from the previous session to $9.90 a barrel.

Exports from China are also likely to remain capped amid little incentive to raise runs due to lukewarm margins, a light distillates trading source said.

Meanwhile, the margin for naphtha (NAF-SIN-CRK) closed lower on Thursday at $107.30 a metric ton. Demand outlook is cautious amid capped petrochemical margins, another industry source said.

In Singapore, light distillate stocks eased by 94,000 barrels to 16.3 million barrels in the week ended February 12, after building to a 21-month high in the previous week, Enterprise Singapore data showed.

Elsewhere, U.S. East Coast gasoline inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels to 66.7 million barrels in the week ended February 7, the highest since July 2021, according to U.S. EIA data.
