Entain's lack of a permanent boss makes it vulnerable, AJ Bell's Russ Mould writes in a note. A rival betting group or private equity could come around looking for takeover opportunities, he adds. Chief Executive Gavin Isaacs agreed to leave after just 161 days in the job. The London-listed company really needs to find someone with bold ideas to put it back on a winning streak, Mould says. "One could speculate that Isaacs didn't fit with the culture of Entain or that he didn't see eye to eye on strategy. It's worth noting that previous Entain boss Shay Segev only lasted 189 days in the top job in 2020-21, so the gambling group has form when it comes to short-lived leadership," Mould adds. Shares are down 10.4% at 665.20 pence. (najat.kantouar@wsj.com)
