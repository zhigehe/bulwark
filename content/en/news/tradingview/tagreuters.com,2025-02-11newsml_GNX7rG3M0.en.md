NAPLES, Fla. and CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: CDT) (“**Conduit**” or the “**Company**”), today announces the repayment of its $600,000 promissory note (the “**Note**”) to Nirland Limited (“**Nirland**”) and provided an update on the conversion of its Senior Secured Promissory Note (the “**Senior Note**”) with Nirland. On February 7, 2025, Conduit repaid the final balance of the Note in full, satisfying all obligations under the agreement. The Note, issued on October 28, 2024, had an original principal amount of $600,000, bore interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and was due to mature on October 31, 2025.

In addition, as of February 10, 2025, Nirland has converted approximately $1.7 million of the original $2.65 million principal amount under the Senior Note into shares of Conduit’s common stock. The Senior Note, initially entered into on August 6, 2024, and subsequently amended in October and November 2024, bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, accruing daily and payable monthly in arrears, either in cash or as accrued at Nirland’s discretion. The conversion further reduces Conduit’s debt obligations and aligns Nirland’s interests with those of the Company’s shareholders.

Conduit remains focused on leveraging its strengthened financial position to support its strategic goals and deliver value to shareholders.

**About Conduit Pharmaceuticals**

Conduit is a dynamic, multi-asset clinical stage, life science company delivering an efficient model for compound development. Conduit both acquires and funds the development of Phase 2-ready assets, building an integrated and advanced platform-driven approach powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and cybernetics, and seeking an exit through third-party license deals following successful clinical trials. Led by a highly experienced team of pharmaceutical executives including Dr. David Tapolczay and Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, this novel approach is a departure from the traditional pharma/biotech business model of taking assets through regulatory approval.

**Forward-Looking Statements**

This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding Conduit's future results of operations and financial position, Conduit's business strategy, prospective product candidates, product approvals, research and development costs, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, future results of current and anticipated studies and business endeavors with third parties, and future results of current and anticipated product candidates, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believe," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "future," "opportunity," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to; the inability to maintain the listing of Conduit's securities on Nasdaq; the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination completed in September 2023, which may be affected by, among other things, competition; the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; the risks that Conduit's product candidates in development fail clinical trials or are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other applicable authorities on a timely basis or at all; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Conduit may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks as identified in filings made by Conduit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, Conduit operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond Conduit's control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, Conduit assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Conduit gives no assurance that it will achieve its expectations.
