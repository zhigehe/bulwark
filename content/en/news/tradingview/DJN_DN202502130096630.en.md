UBS Asset Management is overweight global government bonds in anticipation of further slowdown in inflation and more rate cuts by central banks, says multi-asset strategy head Evan Brown in a monthly asset class view. "We continue to think inflation will decelerate this year, supporting the global easing cycle (ex. Japan)," he says. Valuations in most developed market rates markets remain attractive with rates still broadly restrictive, according to UBS AM's asset class view. However, the asset manager is shifting duration exposure from the U.S. to non-U.S. bond markets as it can help address inflation risks, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
