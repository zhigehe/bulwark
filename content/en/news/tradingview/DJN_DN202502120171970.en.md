A February rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia is the most probable outcome but remains far from certain, says Carl Ang, a research analyst at MFS Investment Management. Market expectations around a February cut firmed after quarterly inflation came inside the RBA's target band, Ang says in a note. However, the current tightening labor market and fiscal expansion set a fundamentally different backdrop than the low-rate environment prepandemic and could lead RBA easing to progress more slowly than anticipated, Ang says. The U.S. tariff outlook and its implications for Asia-Pacific economies, especially on China, are also key uncertainties. Ang's base case remains for cash rate cuts every quarter in 2025.
