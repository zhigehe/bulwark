Airbus' planned hydrogen-fueled aircraft project has been delayed beyond its 2035 deadline, Bloomberg News reported Feb. 7,Â 2025, citing French labor unions and the aerospace manufacturer.

The unions said the aircraft's entry into service has been delayed by five to 10 years while Airbus did not provide a new timeline and did not comment on the delay indicated by the union, the news outlet reported.

Airbus said the availability of clean hydrogen at scale is slower than expected and the development of a hydrogen ecosystem is proving to be challenging, Bloomberg reported.

Airbus did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
