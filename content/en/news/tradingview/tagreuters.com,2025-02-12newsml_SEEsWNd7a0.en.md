SARAJEVO (Bosnia and Herzegovina), February 12 (SeeNews) - The tax authority of Bosnia’s Serb Republic said it has collected 288.4 million marka ($153 million/147.5 million euro) in public revenue in January, marking an 8% increase compared to the same month of 2024.

The collected direct taxes increased by 16% on the year to 53.3 million marka in January, the Serb Republic’s tax authority said in a report earlier this month.

The revenue from income tax rose 19% on the year to 32.6 million marka, while the collected profit tax grew 12% to 18.6 million marka.
