The Hong Kong government will review bond issuances in the coming years as it assesses the city's budget, The Standard reported Thursday, citing Financial Services and Treasury Secretary Christopher Hui Ching-yu.

After considering the proceeds from the city's bond issuances, the current overall deficit for the 2024-2025 year is forecast to be below HK$100 billion, the report said.

The government is looking for means to boost fiscal consolidation and control expenditures while also reviewing the scale, priority, and urgency of infrastructure spending, according to the report.

Finance Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in October 2024 that Hong Kong would continue with bond issuances to raise between HK$120 billion and HK$130 billion yearly, according to the report.
