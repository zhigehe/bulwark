Kodal Minerals said Tuesday it produced the first spodumene concentrate at its Bougouni lithium project in Southern Mali, ahead of schedule.

The initial production was achieved during the commissioning phase of the project's stage 1 dense media separation processing plant, with the initial run delivering an assay at a concentrate grade of 5.53% lithium oxide.

The mineral exploration company will ramp up the facility to nameplate capacity in the coming weeks, expecting to achieve steady state production and confirm arrangements for its first shipment to China by the end of March.
