Amid dangerous flooding, a group of farmers are growing rice in submerged fields

**NORTHAMPTON, MA /** **ACCESS Newswire** **/ February 7,Â 2025 /** Torrential downpours and floods have put millions of people at risk in South Sudan. The country once had seasonal rainy and dry periods, but the past several years filled with unprecedented natural disasters has permanently altered the landscape. The unpredictable rain and extreme weather have left 226,000 people displaced and eight million people hungry.

In fact, floods have submerged entire neighborhoods, destroying schools, homes, and markets alike. Nearly 60 healthcare facilities have been inundated, and 15 major roads are obstructed. Countless families lack access to basic necessities like food, clean water, shelter, and medical care.

Action Against Hunger teams have been on the ground in South Sudan since 1985, working in places like Paguir, Old Fangak, and New Fangak to help people in need. Even before the floods began, vulnerable communities throughout the country struggled with food shortages and poverty. The country has 2 million internally displaced people and hosts over 330,000 refugees, including those who fled Sudan's civil war.

This year, the teams knew the floods weren't going anywhere. Action Against Hunger's new project taught farmers how to grow rice within the flood waters. Since the program began, numerous men, women, and children have enjoyed healthy and nutritious rice-based dinners. In the past, many resorted to eating waterlilies to curb hunger.

The crisis isn't over. Floodwaters have continued to cut off people from aid and threatened some of South Sudan's most vulnerable. Still, we're proud to showcase the resilience of the farmers who refused to give up-and who show bravery every day. Take a look at some striking photos of South Sudan's rice growers and the perils they face.

**Hunger to Hope**

Action Against Hunger teaches farmers in Old Fangak how to grow rice within the flood waters. "The rice project from Action Against Hunger has helped to secure our household food," said one woman, Adior. "Right now, my children have all their meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I also managed to buy my children's school uniforms and pay all their fees. We do not have problems anymore. The rice project has improved the household's well-being."
