Humana Inc.'s stock fell 3.3% early Tuesday, after the health insurer and managed care company's quarterly loss widened, it offered guidance that lagged consensus by a wide margin and said it expects to lose another $550,000 Medicare Advantage members in 2025.

Louisville, Ky.-based Humana (HUM) had a per-share loss of $5.76 for the quarter, wider than the loss of $4.42 posted in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items, it had a loss per share of $2.16, while FactSet expected a loss of $2.21.

Revenue rose to $29.213 billion from $26.562 billion a year ago, ahead of the $28.811 billion FactSet consensus.

The company said it expects individual Medicare Advantage annual membership to decline by about 550,000 in 2025, or by about 10% versus 2024, including its planned exit from certain unprofitable plans and counties.

Humana backed its adjusted 2025 EPS guidance which it has said would be "at least in line with 2024 results," or about $15.88. Adjusted EPS is expected to come to $16.25, while FactSet is expecting $16.71.
