India's central bank sold at least $4 billion on Monday and continues to intervene aggressively in the FX market to support the rupee, which has been struggling due to portfolio outflows and uncertainty on U.S. trade tariffs, four traders said.

The Reserve Bank of India likely sold between $4 billion and $7 billion to shore up the currency on Monday as the currency slipped to record lows and was at risk of falling past the 88 handle, the traders said.

RBI's intervention was "extremely aggressive and they sold at least $1.7 billion through us", a trader directly familiar with the central bank's intervention said, estimating that they sold a total of $4.5 billion to $5 billion.

The traders did not want to be identified since they are not authorized to speak to the media. A mail seeking comment from the RBI went unanswered.

The central bank's aggressive intervention continued on Tuesday, lifting the rupee above the 87 level.

The currency , which fell to an all-time low of 87.95 in opening trades on Monday, was last quoting at 86.86 to the dollar.

The rupee is facing multiple headwinds, including uncertainty on U.S. trade policies, foreign portfolio outflows and sluggish economic growth in India, which prompted the central bank to cut rates last week.

Despite the recovery spurred by RBI's intervention, the rupee remains among the worst-performing Asian currencies year-to-date.

On both Monday and Tuesday, the RBI intervened before spot over-the-counter markets opened, the traders said.

The intervention over the two days is a departure from how the central bank has been managing the currency in recent weeks.

The RBI had previously been intervening at a steady pace without the intention to push the rupee higher, traders said.

The current intervention is "probably designed to make it known that the RBI will not tolerate one-sided moves and bets", a chief FX dealer at a private sector bank said.

"I think they have seen how excessively long (on dollar/rupee) the market was. They decided to do something about that."
