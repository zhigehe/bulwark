Mortgage applications rose last week due to a double-digit increase in refinancing activity as mortgage rates continued to decline, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.

The market composite index, which measures loan application volume, increased 2.3% for the week ended Feb. 7 on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a gain of 2.2% in the week prior. Without adjustments, the index advanced 6% on a weekly basis.

The refinance index jumped 10% from the week before, while the seasonally adjusted purchase index dipped 2%.

"Mortgage rates moved slightly lower last week, which led to the pace of refinance applications reaching its strongest week since October 2024," Joel Kan, the association's deputy chief economist, said.

Those borrowers tend to be "more responsive" to rate changes, he said.

The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $766,550 or less decreased to 6.95% from 6.97% the week earlier. For loan balances higher than that amount, the rate dipped to 6.96% from 7.01%. For 15-year loans, the rate edged down to 6.35% from 6.36% week over week.

The average purchase application loan size climbed to its highest level since March 2022, at $456,100. That was driven in part by fewer Federal Housing Administration applications, which are often used by first-time home buyers and can involve smaller down payments, and an increase in Veterans Affairs loans, according to Kan.

Fixed-rate mortgages with 30-year terms backed by the FHA held steady week to week at 6.69%, while its share of total loan applications dipped to 16% from 16.2% the week earlier.
