BYD will see stronger store traffic in the near future, primarily due to its 21 new models equipped with its driving-assistance technology system, called "Eyes of God," OCBC analysts write in a note. The Chinese automaker also revealed plans to integrate DeepSeek into their models, they add. The new models will boost store traffic when they arrive over the next few months, the analysts say. The significant volume of 21 model upgrades with ADAS could make it difficult for peers to respond quickly and effectively in the next three to six months, they add. OCBC maintains a buy rating on the stock at a fair value of CNY425.00. Shares were last at CNY341.30. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
