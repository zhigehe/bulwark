Malaysia's gross domestic product rose 5% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a Friday press release by the Department of Statistics Malaysia.

Economists polled by Reuters expected a 4.8% expansion.

Growth in Q4 was slower compared with the 5.4% growth experienced in the third quarter, the department said.

Malaysia's services sector saw GDP increase by 5.5% in Q4 compared with 5.2% in Q3, while manufacturing slowed to 4.4% from 5.6% in the previous quarter.

Overall, the economy grew 5.1% year over year in 2024, in line with the flash estimate, but faster than the 3.6% expansion in 2023.
