IGM Financial reported adjusted EPS of $1.05, up 22%, in line with the street and NBF's $1.05.

An in-line quarter with positive operating leverage likely gets IGM moving in the right direction, writes analyst Jaeme Gloyn. Shares are roughly flat since third quarter results in early November, but market uncertainty tied to tariff could weigh on share price upside near-term.

Despite softer earnings at ChinaAMC in Q4, IGM's more rapid growth segments continue to deliver solid growth, Gloyn adds.

Raising target by $1, to $54. Maintain Outperform.
