Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart typically posted by the tech executive on Sundays, hinting at another Bitcoin acquisition the following day, after a one-week break in buying.

"Death to the blue lines. Long live the green dots," the tech executive wrote to his 4.1 million followers on X.

According to SaylorTracker, Strategy currently holds 471,107 BTC, valued at approximately $45.3 billion, following its most recent purchase of 10,107 BTC on Jan. 27.

The company continues focusing on acquiring BTC for its corporate treasury strategy amid a recent rebrand and sideways price action on shares of its stock.![MicroStrategy, Bitcoin Adoption, Michael Saylor](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:fc3a6aed5094b-63e61024f4b9e10f7313a9add4439ccd-resized.jpeg)

**MicroStrategy rebrands to "Strategy"**

MicroStrategy rebranded to "Strategy" on Feb. 5 and adopted the Bitcoin logo and a Bitcoin-colored marketing scheme to better reflect the company's ethos and core operations.

MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le released this statement alongside the rebrand announcement:

“Strategy is innovating in the two most transformative technologies of the twenty-first century — Bitcoin and artificial intelligence. Our new name powerfully, and simply, conveys the universal and global appeal of our company."

The company also conducted an earnings call on the same day the rebrand was announced to discuss Q4 2024 financial results.

According to the earnings call, Strategy reported $120.7 million in revenue for its software business — a 3% year-over-year decrease — and a $640 million loss for the quarter.![MicroStrategy, Bitcoin Adoption, Michael Saylor](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:fc3a6aed5094b-65f1a5b81978db91166b42af3e28b4e5-resized.jpeg)

Despite this, the company continued aggressively accumulating BTC, with Q4 2024 representing the company's biggest quarterly Bitcoin addition in terms of the number of coins purchased.

Strategy acquired 195 BTC in Q4 2024 alone and outlined several bullish price catalysts for BTC in 2025.

These catalysts included a potential framework for digital assets in the United States, political support for Bitcoin, improvements to existing BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing institutional adoption.![MicroStrategy, Bitcoin Adoption, Michael Saylor](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:fc3a6aed5094b-48737d097fdc05de0eb73bec5c54ce20-resized.jpeg)

The company's stock is currently trading at around $327 per share — a nearly 40% decrease from the all-time high of approximately $543 per share recorded in November 2024.

Strategy has been trading in a range since the all-time high but remains above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is a critical and dynamic level of support for any market-traded asset.
