US equity futures were little changed pre-bell Thursday ahead of the producer inflation report.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures flatlined, S&P 500 futures declined 0.1%, and Nasdaq futures gained 0.1%.

Oil prices were lower, with front-month global benchmark North Sea Brent crude down 1.2% at $74.25 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude 1.4% lower at $70.40 per barrel.

New unemployment claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 am ET, are expected to decline to 217,000 in the week ended Feb. 8 from 219,000 in the preceding week. Forecasters see the final demand for producer prices gaining 0.3% in January following a 0.2% gain in December, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
