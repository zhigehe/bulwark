MetaGravity's decision to launch its games on Immutable could be a positive sign for Immutable’s ecosystem. By introducing popular games like Edge of Chaos on their platform, Immutable might attract new users and increase activity on its blockchain. This kind of integration can lead to more transactions and interest in the IMX token, potentially driving its price higher. However, much depends on the popularity of the games and user engagement. If MetaGravity attracts a large player base, the benefit to Immutable could be significant. source
