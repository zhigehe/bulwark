Sony Group's net income attributable to owners of the parent rose nearly 21% to 943.9 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from 781.6 billion yen a year ago on increased financial services, G&NS and music sales.

There were also foreign exchange gains and the absence of insurance finance expenses during the December quarter.

Earnings per share increased to 155.25 yen from 126.39 yen a year ago, according to a filing on Thursday.

Sales and financial services revenue grew 8.2% to 10.327 trillion yen from about 9.540 trillion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, Sony has revised its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31 due to an expected decrease in tax expenses after the dissolution of a subsidiary and repayment of capital from the subsidiary.

It forecasted consolidated (including financial services) attributable net income to increase 11.3% to 1.08 trillion yen, and sales to rise 1.4% to 13.20 trillion yen.

The company expects to pay a year-end dividend of 10 yen per share, before accounting for its five-for-one stock split.

Sony shares gained nearly 8% in Friday's morning trade.
