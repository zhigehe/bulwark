U.S. President Trump's tariffs are likely to depress the Australian dollar against its Singapore counterpart in 2025, similar to the impact observed in 2018-2019, according to Philip Wee of DBS Group Research. While the U.S. has trade surpluses with both Australia and Singapore, the currencies of the countries aren't immune to the global growth risks posed by Trump's tariffs, the senior forex strategist writes in a note. He expects AUD/SGD to weaken to the 0.80-0.85 range. As a free-floating commodity-led currency, the Australian dollar will be more vulnerable if Trump's universal tariffs negatively impact the global economy and financial markets, fueling risk aversion, he says. Meanwhile, the Singapore dollar is less volatile and "a more attractive currency driven by an exchange rate policy backed by strong fundamentals," Wee adds. (farah.elias@wsj.com)
