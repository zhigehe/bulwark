Sugar production in Thailand, the world's second largest exporter, is set to climb further in the 2025/26 season, potentially to the highest in seven years, trade and industry sources said on Thursday.

Falling cassava prices have incentivised farmers to grow more sugar cane, and production growth is expected in the autumn to autumn 2025/2026 season, Sasathorn Sanguandeekul, executive market analyst at Thai sugar producer Mitr Phol Group, said.

Sanguandeekul said cane production next season was seen rising to 105 million metric tons from 92 million in the current season, while sugar output was projected to climb to 11.5 million from about 10.3 million to 10.4 million.

"Local consumption is relatively low, ranging between 2.5 to 3.0 million tons, which leaves big room for exports," she told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual Dubai Sugar Conference.

After a sharp drop in Thai sugar production in the 2019/20 season due to the worst drought in four decades - from which yields have yet to fully recover - many farmers switched to cassava, which generally performs better in drought conditions.

However, a drop in prices has prompted some to switch back to cane.

"Cane and sugar production is expected to continue to rise (in the 2025/26 season) because the cassava price has fallen by about 37%," Marex analyst Robin Shaw told the conference.

Shaw estimated Thailand's sugar production in the 2024/25 season at 11.0 million tons and projected a rise in the cane planting area next season to 1.90 million hectares from 1.89 million.

Commodity analysts Green Pool projected in a report last week a larger 10% rise in cane area in Thailand for the 2025/26 season linked to the ongoing decline in cassava prices.

The Australia-based firm said that assuming close to normal rainfall and a small improvement in cane yields, its early forecast for 2025/26 was for sugar production to rise by 18% to 13.2 million tons.
