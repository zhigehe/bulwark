Praemium issued an earn-out statement to Iress on Wednesday advising that no earn-out is owed under the terms of its acquisition of the OneVue platform business from the firm, according to a same-day filing with the Australian bourse.

The statement is in relation to the first earn-out period, based on the funds under administration from OneVue clients on the platform as of Jan. 15.

The second earn-out will be based on funds under administration from the clients on the platform as of Oct. 15.

The lack of an earn-out was attributed by the firm to the estimated funds under administration on the OneVue platform in the period being less than the AU$3 billion threshold due to a termination agreed with a OneVue client as well as outflows from existing clients from the platform since the date of acquisition.
