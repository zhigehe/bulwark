Adds detail and updates prices.)

Gold edged down from a record high mid-afternoon on Tuesday as treasury yields rose as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell began two days of testimony to Congress amid fresh tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration.

Gold for April delivery was last seen down US$1.10 to US$2,931.30 per ounce, falling from Monday's record close of US$2,934.40.

The price of the metal has risen 11% since the start of 2025, pushed higher by safe-haven buying as Donald Trump threatens to upset global trade. Trump on Monday signed an order to impose 25% tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum beginning on March 12, while last week postponing for 30 days plans to impose similar tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners.

The Federal Reserve last month stood pat on interest rates after three cuts in 2024 and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at the March 19 end to the next two-day meeting of its policy committee despite pressure from Trump to lower rates. Fed chair Powell is appearing before the Senate and the House today and Wednesday for his semi-annual congressional testimony.

"Powell's Congressional testimony today will be closely monitored for rate policy guidance, especially with US January CPI data due tomorrow. A hot inflation print could disrupt expectations of two Fed rate cuts in 2025, influencing market sentiment and rate-sensitive assets," Saxo Bank noted.

The dollar eased, with the ICE dollar index last seen 0.28 points to 108.04.

Treasury yields rose, increasing the carrying cost of owning gold. The U.S. two-year note was last seen paying 4.294%, up 0.9 basis points, while the yield on the 10-year note was up 3.4 points to 4.532%.
