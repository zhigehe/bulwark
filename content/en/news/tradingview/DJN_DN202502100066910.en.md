Adverse weather was a major cause of depressed job creation in January, the San Francisco Fed's Weather-Adjusted Employment Change tool suggests. The BLS reported 143,000 jobs created last month. The Fed tool adjusts the data for weather that deviates from historical seasonal norms. The model's weather-adjusted total employment is estimated at 223,000, or 227,000 when regional weather conditions are factored in. The BLS said that weather had no discernible effect on payroll employment. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
