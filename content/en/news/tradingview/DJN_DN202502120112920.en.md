Chef's Warehouse hit a 52-week high after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.

The stock traded as high as $62.13 earlier in the session, and was 12% higher, at $61.18, at 1:25 p.m. ET.

The food distributor said it had quarterly earnings of $23.9 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $16 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of $21.7 million, or 51 cents a share.

Sales for the quarter were $1.03 billion, compared with last year's $950.5 million and the $1 billion analysts were expecting.

Organic case count in the fourth quarter increased 6.1% in the company's specialty category, with unique customers and placements increases at 4.5% and 12.3% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Organic pounds sold in the Company's center-of-the-plate category increased 3.6%, compared to the prior year quarter.

Chefs' Warehouse also said it is expecting fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.94 billion to $4.04 billion, while analysts are forecasting 2025 revenue of $4 billion.
