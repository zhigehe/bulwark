By Emese Bartha

Italy hired banks for the syndicated launch of a new 15-year, October 2040-dated government bond, or BTP, the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance said Monday.

The transaction is planned in the near future, subject to market conditions.

Italy's government bond auction on Thursday won't include BTPs longer than 10-years of maturity given the coming syndicated transaction, the ministry said.

Italy's mid-month BTP auctions usually include three- and seven-year BTPs, as well as BTPs with longer than 10 year maturity.

The banks hired as joint lead managers are Barclays Bank Ireland, Deutsche Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Morgan Stanley Europe and Nomura Financial Products Europe.
