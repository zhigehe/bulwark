Powerfleet, Inc., a global leader in the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) software-as-a-service (SaaS) mobile asset industry, has released its financial results for the third quarter of 2025. This marks the first full quarter following the acquisition of Fleet Complete and the third full quarter since the business combination with MiX Telematics Ltd.

**Financial Highlights**

Powerfleet reported a significant increase in its financial performance for the third quarter of 2025. Total revenue rose by 45% year-over-year to $106.4 million, driven by the Fleet Complete acquisition and strong in-warehouse product sales. Service revenue accounted for 77% of total revenue, increasing by 45% to $81.7 million. Product revenue grew by 42% to $24.7 million.

Gross profit increased by 44% to $58.8 million, with adjusted gross profit rising by 57% to $64.2 million. The combined adjusted gross margin exceeded 60%, up from 55.5% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA saw a substantial increase of 77% to $22.5 million, reflecting contributions from the Fleet Complete acquisition, organic growth, and cost synergies.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Powerfleet's strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded its market opportunities. The Fleet Complete acquisition has bolstered the company's service revenue, while Unity’s safety-focused solutions have driven growth in the service segment. The company now has over 2.6 million recurring revenue subscribers actively using its comprehensive suite of solutions.

On the commercial front, Powerfleet secured a major Unity in-warehouse safety solution deal with one of the largest beverage companies in North America, with long-term total contract value revenue potential in the $25 million to $30 million range. Additionally, AI camera solutions have gained strong traction, with sales volumes up 52% year-over-year through the company's largest channel partner.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Powerfleet's post-M&A integration is ahead of schedule, positioning the company for a double-digit growth trajectory in FY26. The cost synergy program remains on track, with $15 million in annualized savings secured exiting the December quarter and more than $16 million targeted by fiscal year-end. The company has also raised its full-year 2025 guidance, with annual revenue now expected to exceed $362.5 million and adjusted EBITDA expected to exceed $75 million.

**Management's Perspective**

CEO Steve Towe commented on the company's strategic focus on achieving global scale through accretive M&A transactions, which has fundamentally reshaped the business. He emphasized the importance of seamlessly integrating the combined businesses and executing strategic priorities to position Powerfleet for accelerated top-line growth.

**Future Outlook**

Powerfleet has raised its full-year 2025 guidance to reflect the strength of its year-to-date financial performance and the accounting impact of Fleet Complete’s conversion from Canadian accounting standards to U.S. GAAP. The company expects annual revenue to exceed $362.5 million and adjusted EBITDA to exceed $75 million, inclusive of $5 million in secured annualized run-rate synergies.
