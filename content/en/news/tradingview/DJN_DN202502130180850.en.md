Oil prices are higher in early Asian trade, supported in part by the delay in President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. President Trump on Thursday ordered federal agencies to explore how to adjust U.S. tariffs to match those of other countries until April without imposing the tariffs immediately. The sentiment is further supported by IEA's more bullish outlook on the oil market, ANZ Research says in a research note. The IEA expects the global oil surplus to be only 450,000 barrels per day in 2025, half the surplus it forecasted two months ago, ANZ says. Front-month WTI rises 0.2% to $71.47/bbl and Brent is 0.3% higher at $75.23/bbl.(sherry.qin@wsj.com)
