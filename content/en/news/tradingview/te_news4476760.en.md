Wheat futures fell toward $5.70 per bushel, weighed down by a lack of bullish momentum and ongoing uncertainty driven by trade policy concerns.

At the same time, the USDA lowered its supply outlook, citing adverse weather conditions in Europe and the Black Sea region.

The USDA’s latest WASDE report made only minor revisions to domestic wheat supply and demand forecasts, contributing to a subdued market response.

Despite the downturn, global wheat production remains a key concern, with shifting weather patterns and potential supply disruptions posing risks to future price movements.

The WASDE data also highlighted global inventory trends, underscoring that wheat availability will continue to play a crucial role in international trade.

Market participants are closely monitoring these factors, along with broader agricultural trade policies and economic conditions.
