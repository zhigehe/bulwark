Relief Therapeutics said Tuesday the European Patent Office approved its patent application for the therapeutic uses of oxidizing hypotonic acid solutions.

The patent is expected to be formally issued on Feb. 26. The Swiss biopharmaceutical company said the decision will safeguard the therapeutic applications of its proprietary hypochlorous acid solutions, which include RLFâ€‘TD011, the investigational treatment for wounds due to epidermolysis bullosa in European countries.

The company noted that it has similar patent proposals under review in major markets, including the US and China.
