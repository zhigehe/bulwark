Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures closed lower on Tuesday as traders shifted focus to weather in key wheat-growing regions, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture in its monthly supply/demand report cut its supply outlook following adverse weather in Europe and the Black Sea region.

* The USDA cut its world ending stocks for wheat to 257.56 million bushels, down from 258.82 million bushels in January.
* Snow cover in the U.S. Plains and Black Sea has eased worries about freeze damage to the key wheat-growing regions, analysts said.
* The wheat market was being underpinned by rising prices and slowing shipments in [Russia](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia/), where authorities have set a restrictive export quota for February 15 to June 30.
* Consultancy IKAR cut its Russian wheat export forecast due to low stocks.
* Traders also monitored reactions to U.S. President Donald Trump signing proclamations raising tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. to a flat 25%, in a move that risks sparking a multi-front trade war.
