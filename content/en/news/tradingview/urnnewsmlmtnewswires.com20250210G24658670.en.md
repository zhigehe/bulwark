Supplier costs to New Zealand supermarkets rose 2.1% year on year in January, following a 2.2% increase in the prior month, according to the Infometrics-Foodstuffs New Zealand Grocery Supplier Cost Index report released Monday.

Prices across all departments grew, led by a 3.7% increase in bakery costs. A 3.4% rise in chilled food followed amid higher dairy input costs. Produce costs rose 1.2% as cheaper fruits were offset by higher costs of capsicum.

Diesel costs rose as a continued lower exchange rate heightened risks around imported cost pressures and wider transport costs, the report said.

On a monthly basis, over 1,400 items increased in costs in January, marking the lowest number of January increases counted since 2021, per the report. January is impacted by the usual summer cost change moratorium on most items, the report noted.

The Infometrics-Foodstuffs New Zealand Grocery Supplier Cost Index measures the change in the list cost of grocery goods charged by suppliers to the Foodstuffs North Island and Foodstuffs South Island co-operatives.
