\*\* Mizuho lowers rating on Jell-O maker Kraft Heinz to "neutral" from "outperform", citing eroding volumes in food industry

\*\* Brokerage attributes weakness in food processing industry to effect of dietary changes and increased use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, as well as inflation likely hitting relative value for some product categories

\*\* Potential confirmation of Robert Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services would likely ramp attention on additives and food processing - Mizuho

\*\* Cuts PT to $31 from $38 owing to persistent weakness in demand for KHC's products as consumers across income groups opt for cheaper alternatives

\*\* Kraft Heinz is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday

\*\* 7 of 23 brokerages rate stock "buy" or "higher", 15 "hold" and one "sell"; their median PT is $33.50 - LSEG

\*\* KHC fell about 17% in 2024
