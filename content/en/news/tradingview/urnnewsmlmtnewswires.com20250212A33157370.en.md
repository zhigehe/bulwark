(Updates shares.)

First Mining Gold reported on Wednesday final drill results from the 2024 East Extension phase 1 diamond drilling program at its Springpole gold project in Ontario.

Highlights include 0.75 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 3.30 g/t silver over 134.2 meters, and 0.67 g/t gold and 12.79 g/t silver over 105.4 meters.

First Mining said the results confirm an opportunity for direct mineralization expansion in continuity to the current open pit profile, which remains open for further exploration.

"The results from the East Extension are especially encouraging as they demonstrate the presence of additional gold and silver mineralization inside the existing mine footprint, potentially converting waste to ore," CEO Dan Wilton said.

The company said its upcoming exploration activities will focus on integrating the latest drill hole results into an updated 3D model and delineating further plans to unlock opportunities for the East Extension target, as well as near open pit brownfields exploration targets.

"As we continue to advance through the Environmental Assessment process, we believe that the Springpole project will be a major economic and sustainable infrastructure driver for Northwestern Ontario communities," Wilton said.

The company's shares were last seen down $0.005 to $0.14 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
