Encouraging details in the wholesale inflation report have driven Treasury yields back down to the levels seen before Wednesday's surprisingly hot consumer-price data.

The yield move serves as another reminder CPI data isn't the final word on inflation, despite the greater attention it gets.

In recent trading:

* The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 4.537%, according to Tradeweb.
* That was down from 4.636% Wednesday after the CPI data, and close to Tuesday's settlement of 4.536%.

Interest-rate futures show traders now see a 38% chance the Federal Reserve cuts rates at least twice this year, according to CME data. That is up from 30% Wednesday.
