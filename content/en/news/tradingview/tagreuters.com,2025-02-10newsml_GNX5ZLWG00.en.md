BASE SHELF PROSPECTUS IS ACCESSIBLE, AND PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS, ON SEDAR+

NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES OR OVER UNITED STATES WIRE SERVICES

MONTREAL, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Rogers Sugar Inc. (the “**Company**” or “**Rogers Sugar**”) announced today a public offering (the “**Offering**”) of $75,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Eighth Series convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (the “**Offered Debentures**”), at an offering price of $1,000 per Offered Debenture (the “**Offering Price**”). The Offered Debentures will bear interest at an annual rate of 6.0% per annum, payable semi-annually on the last day of June and December commencing on June 30, 2025. The Offered Debentures will mature on June 30, 2030 (the “**Maturity Date**”).

The Offering is being made through a syndicate of underwriters co-led by TD Securities Inc. and Scotiabank (collectively, the “**Underwriters**”) on a bought deal basis. The Offered Debentures will be convertible at the holder’s option into common shares of the Company (the “**Debenture Shares**”) at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Montreal time) on the earlier of the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date and the business day immediately preceding the date fixed by the Company for redemption of the Offered Debentures, at a conversion price of $7.10 per Debenture Share (the “**Conversion Price**”). The Offered Debentures will not be redeemable prior to June 30, 2028. On or after June 30, 2028 and prior to June 30, 2029, the Offered Debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part from time to time at the Company’s option, at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that the weighted average trading price of the common shares in the capital of the Company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “**TSX**”) for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day preceding the date upon which the notice of redemption is given is at least 125% of the Conversion Price. On or after June 30, 2029 and prior to the Maturity Date, the Offered Debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part from time to time at the Company’s option at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Company has granted to the Underwriters an option (the “**Over-Allotment Option**”), exercisable in whole or in part and at any time up to 30 days after the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an additional $11,250,000 aggregate principal amount of Offered Debentures (being up to 15% of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Debentures sold in the Offering) at the Offering Price, to cover over-allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering will be $86,250,000.

The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facility of Lantic Inc. (“**Lantic**”), a subsidiary of the Company, and for general corporate purposes.

The Offered Debentures will be offered in each of the provinces of Canada pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Company’s final short form base shelf prospectus dated August 14, 2023 (the “**Shelf Prospectus**”) that will be filed by no later than February 12, 2025 (the “**Prospectus Supplement**”). The Offering is expected to close on or about February 19, 2025 and is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory and TSX approval.
