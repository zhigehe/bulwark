Herc Holdings Inc., a leading equipment rental supplier, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024. The company has also provided guidance for the full year 2025. Despite facing a challenging market environment, Herc Holdings achieved record results in several key financial metrics.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Herc Holdings reported record equipment rental revenue of $839 million, marking a 12% increase from the prior-year period. Total revenues for the quarter reached $951 million, a 14% year-over-year increase. However, the company reported a net loss of $46 million, or $1.62 per share, primarily due to a $194 million loss on Cinelease assets held for sale. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $102 million, or $3.58 per diluted share, an 11% increase from the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose by 15% to $438 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 46.1%.

For the full year 2024, Herc Holdings achieved record equipment rental revenue of $3,189 million, an 11% increase from 2023. Total revenues for the year were $3,568 million, up 9% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $211 million, or $7.40 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the year was $367 million, or $12.88 per diluted share, a 5% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased by 9% to $1,583 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44.4%. Free cash flow for the year was $314 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Herc Holdings' business performance was bolstered by strategic pricing, agile fleet management, and enterprise-wide cost controls. The company completed nine acquisitions in 2024, adding 28 locations and opening 23 new greenfield locations. These actions supported market consolidation and positioned the company for long-term growth opportunities and greater efficiencies of scale.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In 2024, Herc Holdings declared a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, paid to shareholders on December 27, 2024. The company also maintained a net debt of $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2024, with a net leverage ratio of 2.5x, unchanged from the previous year. Herc Holdings' liquidity stood at approximately $1.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility.

**Management's Perspective**

Larry Silber, President and CEO of Herc Holdings, commented on the company's performance, stating, "In 2024, despite a more challenging market than anticipated, we delivered another year of record results, significantly outperforming industry revenue growth by leveraging the strength of tenured customer relationships, the value derived from strategic capital-allocation priorities, and our diversified position across products, geographies, and end markets."

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, Herc Holdings has provided guidance excluding the Cinelease studio entertainment business, which is expected to be sold in 2025. The company forecasts equipment rental revenue growth of 4% to 6%, adjusted EBITDA between $1.575 billion and $1.650 billion, and net rental equipment capital expenditures ranging from $400 million to $600 million. Herc Holdings aims to continue gaining market share by investing in its fleet, optimizing existing assets, and capitalizing on strategic acquisitions and greenfield opportunities.
