ADS/TEC Energy filed a shelf registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission covering the potential sale of up to $250 million of securities from time to time in one or more offerings.

The statement covers ordinary and preferred shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, purchase contracts, and units.

The company said it plans to use any net proceeds for its operations and for other general corporate purposes.

ADS/TEC said the statement also contains a secondary offering prospectus covering the potential sale of up to about 10.5 million shares by some security holders. The shares are issuable upon the exercise of certain warrants acquired by the selling security holders.
