Zensho Holdings' profit attributable to owners of the parent climbed over 56% to 34.1 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from 21.8 billion yen a year ago.

The restaurant chain operator's performance was due to recovering foot traffic and economic normalization, offsetting Ukraine's prolonged crisis and rising food prices.

The company said earnings per share rose to 209.89 yen from 141.10 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing.

Net sales increased close to 20% to 846.8 billion yen from 706.8 billion yen a year earlier.

Zensho Holdings forecasted attributable profit to grow 20.5% to 37 billion yen or 231.37 yen per share and net sales to gain 11.8% to 1.08 trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31.

The company expects to pay a year-end dividend of 35.00 yen per share, bringing the total to 70.00 yen per share for the fiscal year.

Shares of the company fell over 9% in late-morning trade Thursday.
