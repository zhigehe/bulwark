Continued uncertainty around Trump trade tariffs has investors on edge, but Kenanga IB analysts think the direct impact on Malaysia looks limited. The country contributes only about 2% to the U.S. trade deficit, Peter Kong and his team say in a note. Local manufacturers, exporters and tech firms could face some fallout near term, with the analysts estimating that a 5% drop in U.S.-related revenue among the stocks it covers would affect earnings by a maximum of 4%. Any ensuing weakness may present buying opportunities, they add. If tariffs align with regional import duties, Malaysia could be even less affected, easing pressure on exports and supporting market sentiment, they reckon.(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
