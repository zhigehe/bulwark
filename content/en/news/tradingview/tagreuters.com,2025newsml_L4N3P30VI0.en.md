STOCKS:

The benchmark BSE Sensex ended 0.16% lower at 76171.08, while the broader NSE Nifty 50 index declined 0.12% to 23045.25, due to trade war fears and earnings worries.

RUPEE:

The Indian rupee dropped 0.07% to 86.8925 per U.S. dollar as hedging interest from importers and the maturity of positions in the non-deliverable forwards market boosted demand for the dollar.

GOVERNMENT BONDS:

The benchmark 10-year bond (IN067934G=CC) was quoted at 100.605 rupees, with the yield little changed at 6.7022%, after the local retail inflation reading was marginally below estimates, while investors will now focus on U.S. inflation data and central bank debt purchase.

OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAPS:

Both the one-year overnight index swap rate (INR1YMIBROIS=CC) and the five-year swap rate (INR5YMIBROIS=CC) were unchanged at 6.355% and 6.1425% respectively.

CALL MONEY:

India's overnight call money rate (INROND=) was at 5.50% and the overnight TREPS rate (INTREPTOT=TCCL) was at 6.45%.
