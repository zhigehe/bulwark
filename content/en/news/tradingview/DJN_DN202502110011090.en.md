By Andrea Figueras

Kering, the owner of Gucci, reported lower revenue for the fourth quarter at a time when some peers have signaled a potential rebound in demand for luxury goods.

The French luxury group booked revenue of 4.39 billion euros ($4.52 billion) for the last quarter of 2024,Â 12% lower than in the prior-year period. The result compares with analysts' forecast of 4.23 billion euros, according to a poll of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.

The company's star label Gucci posted quarterly sales of 1.92 billion euros, down 24% on year.

"We are confident that we have driven Kering to a point of stabilization, from which we will gradually resume our growth trajectory," Chairman and Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault said.
