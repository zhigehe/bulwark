The S&P/ASX 200 Index close 0.2% higher at 2,556 on Friday, trimming earlier gains.

The index had earlier hit an all-time high as investors cheered following US President Donald Trump’s decision to delay implementing reciprocal tariffs.

Strong corporate earnings from major US companies also supported the bullish sentiment, outweighing concerns over stronger-than-expected inflation figures in the US. Additionally, Australia’s resource-heavy bourse benefitted from rising commodity prices, fueled by a sharp decline in the US dollar and Treasury yields.

Among large-cap stocks, notable gains were seen from CSL Ltd (+1.1%), Wesfarmers (+0.8%), Aristocrat Leisure (+0.7%), and Zip Co (+0.9%).

The benchmark index rose 0.5% for the week and is up 0.3% so far this year.
