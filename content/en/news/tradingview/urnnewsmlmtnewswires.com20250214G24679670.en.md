(Updates to add HSBC's statement)

HSBC Holdings is reportedly planning another round of layoffs at its investment bank as early as Feb. 17 as part of a larger restructuring effort.

The job cuts are said to start in Asia before impacting the British bank's staff worldwide, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Layoffs are expected to be spread out over several weeks and months, reportedly based on performance, job duplication, and operational simplification.

The number of affected employees is unknown, according to the report.

HSBC declined to comment when reached by MT Newswires.
