Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index edges 0.1% higher to 3880.49 as investors appear to shrug off President Trump's announcement on Monday of global 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. The announcement seems to lack any trigger for broad portfolio derisking and U.S. dollar strength, Pepperstone's Chris Weston says in commentary. "The ability of risky markets to absorb the news and maintain a steady bid is telling," the head of research adds. Among the best performers on the benchmark index, Thai Beverage rises 1.0%, Mapletree Logistics Trust adds 0.8% and Genting Singapore is up 0.7%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
