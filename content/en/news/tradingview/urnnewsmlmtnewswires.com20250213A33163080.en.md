Riot Platforms said late Wednesday that it has appointed Jaime Leverton, Doug Mouton, and Michael Turner to its board.

The bitcoin mining company said the three new directors were chosen following a thorough process by the board's governance and nominating committee, which included input from Starboard Value and The D. E. Shaw Group.

The company said that following the appointments, the board will be made up of six members, with Leverton and Mouton serving as Class I directors up for election at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting, and current directors Hannah Cho and Hubert Marleau retiring.
