Dutch payments company Adyen reported full-year core earnings above market expectations on Thursday, helped by an increase in demand for global payments, the group said.

Annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 34% to 992.3 million euros ($1.04 billion), compared with the 974.7 million euros expected on average by 29 analysts polled by LSEG.

The group said it expects a slight acceleration in annual net revenue growth rate in 2025 and further expansion of its EBITDA margin, albeit at a lower rate than in 2024.
