Tivan reached a resourcing protocol agreement for the Speewah vanadium-fluorite project in Western Australia with the Kimberley Land Council Aboriginal Corporation, according to a Friday Australian bourse filing.

The corporation is a recognized native title representative body for the Kimberley region, representing the Nganjuwarr native title claimants.

The agreement establishes the procedures and funding arrangements for the mining firm to conduct talks with the Nganjuwarr registered native title claimants for an indigenous land use agreement.

The firm's shares fell past 4% in recent trading on Friday.
