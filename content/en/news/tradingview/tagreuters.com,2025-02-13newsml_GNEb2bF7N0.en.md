Gilde Healthcare announces successful sale of health-IT software company Performation to Enovation, part of Legrand

* Exit confirms Gilde's investment strategy of building market-leading healthcare companies that deliver better care at lower cost
* Under ownership of Gilde Healthcare’s private equity fund, Performation has evolved into a leading European SaaS healthcare platform through seven strategic acquisitions and product innovations
* Revenue more than doubled and profitability increased threefold

**Utrecht (the Netherlands), February 13, 2025** - Gilde Healthcare, the specialized healthcare investor, today announces the sale of its portfolio company Performation to Enovation, a provider of digital care solutions and a subsidiary of Legrand. Performation's SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform provides innovative healthcare IT solutions to patients, physicians, hospitals and public healthcare organizations. Performation supports more than 200 healthcare institutions, including all hospitals in the Netherlands, with a growing presence across Europe.

Better care at lower cost is a foundational principle of Gilde’s investment strategy, and Performation exemplifies this mission through its comprehensive suite of healthcare technology solutions. The company's platform enables healthcare providers to optimize operational efficiency while improving patient outcomes through advanced business intelligence, capacity management, and real-world monitoring solutions.

Since Gilde Healthcare's investment in 2017, Performation has undergone a strategic transformation from a provider of business intelligence tools and consulting services to a comprehensive SaaS platform. Through seven strategic acquisitions and organic product development, the company has significantly expanded beyond hospitals into adjacent healthcare verticals including rehabilitation, mental health and elderly care, establishing operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Performation became an integral part of the Dutch healthcare system facilitating the Dutch infectious disease management infrastructure and by supporting Oncode Accelerator in the development of new innovative cancer therapies.

Hugo de Bruin, General Partner, Private Equity, at Gilde Healthcare, commented: “European healthcare IT is entering a period of accelerated growth, driven by AI and the increasing importance of real-world data. Performation is right at the center of this data eco-system, providing data and valuable insights to healthcare providers and institutions, while keeping the need of the patient front and center. Performation exemplifies our investment strategy of backing visionary companies that align with this shift and bring innovative solutions to scale.”

“During our holding period, we have supported the management team in executing an ambitious buy-and-build strategy while also investing in product development. We are confident that as part of Legrand's connected care ecosystem, Performation will continue its strong growth trajectory.”
