Fitch said Monday it expects the US' planned 25% tariffs on certain Mexican and Canadian imports to impact global carmakers adversely.

Among European companies in the rating agency's rated portfolio of original equipment manufacturers, Stellantis (STLAM.MI, ) emerged as the carmaker with the highest exposure, which gives it a tight rating headroom. Fitch said a big portion of Stellantis' global sales are imported from the two nations to the US.

Volkswagen was deemed to have medium exposure and Mercedes-Benz low exposure. Both companies have adequate headroom for its ratings, which means they would have greater flexibility to weather the effects of the US tariffs.
