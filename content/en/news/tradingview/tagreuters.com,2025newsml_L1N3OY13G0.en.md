A group representing automakers and electric vehicle charging companies on Friday urged the U.S. Transportation Department to quickly restart a $5 billion government EV infrastructure program.

On Thursday, the Trump administration said it was suspending the electric vehicle charging program and rescinding approval of state EV charging plans pending a new review.

The Electric Drive Transportation Association, whose members include General Motors , Toyota , BorgWarner , EVGo , Stellantis , Walmart and others, said it urged the Trump administration "to quickly resume the critical work of the program and minimize uncertainty for states and their businesses, who have invested in infrastructure to serve local and national goals for advanced transportation."

On President [Donald Trump's](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/) first day in office, he took aim at electric vehicles, saying he was halting distribution of unspent government funds for vehicle charging stations from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund.

Trump also revoked a 2021 executive order signed by his predecessor Joe Biden that sought to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 were electric. Trump also called for ending a waiver for states to adopt zero-emission vehicle rules by 2035 and said his administration would consider ending EV tax credits.

Biden's 50% target, which was not legally binding, had won the support of U.S. and foreign automakers.

Trump has said he could take other actions on EVs, including seeking to repeal the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation.

Last week, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy directed U.S. regulators to rescind landmark fuel economy standards issued under Biden that aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks as well as highway climate rules .

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in June it would hike Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031 from 39.1 mpg currently for light-duty vehicles.
