The dollar falls as hopes for a deal to end the Ukraine-Russia conflict reduce demand for safe-haven assets, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. President Trump said he had a constructive call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday with the leaders agreeing to start negotiations for a peace deal. The dollar's decline comes even after U.S. inflation data Wednesday exceeded expectations. This encourages other currencies to recover losses against the dollar such as the euro, Ozkardeskaya says. The DXY dollar index falls 0.3% to 107.611, having earlier hit a one-week low of 107.502. The euro rises 0.4% to $1.0425 after reaching a one-week high of $1.0441 earlier, according to FactSet.
