BREA, Calif., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — via IBN — Mullen Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: MULN) (“Mullen” or the “Company”), an electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, announced today that it will effect a 1-for-60 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”) of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), that will become effective on Feb. 18, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time. The Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the existing symbol MULN and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on Feb. 18, 2025. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split will be 62526P604.

The Reverse Stock Split is primarily intended to bring the Company into compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for maintaining its listing on Nasdaq. There is no guarantee the Company will meet the minimum bid price requirement.

At the Company’s Special Meeting of Stockholders held on Jan. 31, 2025, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to authorize a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock, at a ratio within the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-100. The Company’s board of directors approved a 1-for-60 reverse split ratio, and the Company will file a Certificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split effective Feb. 18, 2025.

The 1-for-60 Reverse Stock Split will automatically combine and convert 60 current shares of the Company’s Common Stock into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. Proportional adjustments also will be made to outstanding equity awards, warrants and convertible notes, and certain existing agreements pursuant to their terms; however, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, the number of shares then reserved for issuance under such plan will not be adjusted based upon the Reverse Stock Split ratio. Proportionate adjustments will also be made to the per share conversion price of the Company’s series of preferred stock, pursuant to their respective terms. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value of the Common Stock nor the authorized number of shares of Common Stock, preferred stock or any series of preferred stock.

No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. All fractional shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Reverse Stock Split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s equity (other than as a result of the rounding of shares to the nearest whole share in lieu of issuing fractional shares).

The Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, will serve as exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Company’s Common Stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to such broker’s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
