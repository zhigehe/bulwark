Prices for iron ore cargoes with 62% iron content were at $107 per tonne in February, the highest since October of last year, lifted by threats to supply and expectations of traction in demand as markets assessed the impact that steel tariffs by the US may have on global trade.

US President Trump followed through on threats and implemented 25% tariffs on steel from all destinations, denting feedstock demand from steel mills across Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea.

Still, prices were supported by ongoing cyclones in Australia, expected to hit key export hubs for BHP and Fortescue and keep shippers on dock.

This adds to lower exports from Rio Tinto last month due to adverse weather in ports and issues with train lines.

In the meantime, pledges of aggressive fiscal stimulus from top consumer China gained momentum after Beijing signaled it will widen its budget deficit and increase borrowing, limiting the slide in Chinaâ€™s construction demand.
