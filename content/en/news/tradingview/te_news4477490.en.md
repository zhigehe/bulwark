US factory gate prices are expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month in January 2025, up from 0.2% in December.

However, annual producer price inflation is forecast to ease slightly to 3.2% from 3.3%, which had been the highest rate since February 2023.

Meanwhile, core PPI which excluds food and energy, is projected to increase 0.3% on the month, marking the largest gain in four months after a flat reading in December.

On an annual basis, core PPI likely slowed to 3.3% from 3.5% in the previous two months.

The January PPI report will also include an annual update to seasonal adjustment factors, revising data for the past five years, an expected routine adjustment that may lead to historical revisions.
