TOKYO--Honda and Nissan on Thursday officially scrapped their planned merger, less than two months after announcing it, putting pressure on troubled Nissan to look for other partnerships.

The two Japanese automakers had said in December that they planned to combine operations by 2026, but talks quickly broke down.

Honda had initially agreed to a merger of equals but the two companies said Thursday that Honda later sought to make Nissan a subsidiary. That shift angered Nissan's board, a person familiar with the situation said.

The two companies said they would continue a collaboration on auto technology announced last August.
