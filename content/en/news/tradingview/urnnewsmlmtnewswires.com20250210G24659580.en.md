CSL's fiscal first-half adjusted net profit after tax (NPAT) of $2.07 billion fell 4% below estimates by Visible Alpha of $2.16 billion, The Australian reported Tuesday, citing investment bank Barrenjoey.

The company's full fiscal year adjusted NPAT guidance of $3.11 billion to $3.21 billion, including a $90 million "headwind," is 3% below Visible Alpha's estimates of $3.26 billion, per the report.

Barrenjoey noted that CSL's Vifor and Behring divisions reported revenue 4% and 1% above estimates, respectively.

However, its Seqirus division's revenue fell 15% below market estimates due to declining vaccination rates, changing immunization settings, and increased competitive pressures, the investment firm added.
