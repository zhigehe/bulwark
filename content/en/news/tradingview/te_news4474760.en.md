Stocks in the US were lower on Tuesday, with the three major averages losing about 0.3% as traders digested the latest tariff news and awaited Fed Chair Powell's testimony to Congress for further insights into the Fed's plans for the year, as well as comments on inflation and trade policy from the new administration.

President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports with no exceptions or exemptions.

Shares of steel and aluminum producers rose, namely Cleveland-Cliffs (3.1%), US Steel Corp (1.2%), Nucor (2.5%) and Alcoa (1.6%).

Megacaps were mixed, with Apple gaining 1.6% and Alphabet adding 0.2% while Microsoft (-0.4%) and Meta (-0.5%) booked losses and Nvidia and Amazon traded around the flatline.

Tesla was down about 1.7%.

Meanwhile, the earnings season continues with shares of Coca-Cola rising more than 4% after the company's sales topped estimates.
