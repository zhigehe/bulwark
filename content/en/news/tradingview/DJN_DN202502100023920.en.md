Asia looks most exposed to Trump's reciprocal trade tariff proposal, Nomura economists write in a note. Trump has said he will announce such tariffs this week and that they would take effect almost immediately. Countries with the largest tariff gap with the U.S., other than China, are India and Thailand, putting them most at risk, the economists write. However, this reciprocal tariff position may be tempered in practice as the U.S. has broad comprehensive free-trade agreements with several major trade partners, Nomura notes. There is a risk of escalation via other forms of tariffs that Trump has suggested, including on steel, aluminum, pharmaceuticals, and could be China and Europe-specific, it adds.
