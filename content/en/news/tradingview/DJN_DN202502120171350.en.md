Chinese authorities' reported bailout plan to help China Vanke could bolster its long-term viability, Daiwa's William Wu says in a note. Beijing is considering a 50 billion yuan funding to help Vanke repay debt, according to a media report, after the developer's largest shareholder, Shenzhen Metro, offered a 2.8 billion yuan loan earlier this week. While the Shenzhen Metro loan should help Vanke cover the repayment of a bond maturing Feb. 16, it still has another 2 billion yuan of public debt due Feb. 25, the analyst says. "If the bailout plan turns out to be as reported, we expect Vanke to receive funding support in coming weeks." The funding plan wouldn't only alleviate Vanke's near-term credit risks but also signify its ties with the state despite not being fully government-owned, Wu adds. H shares fall 4.9% to HK$6.04.
