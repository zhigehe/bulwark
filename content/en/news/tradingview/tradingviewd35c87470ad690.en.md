Beneficient, a technology-enabled platform providing exit opportunities and primary capital solutions to holders of alternative assets, has released its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on December 31, 2024. The company has reported significant developments and financial metrics that highlight its performance and strategic initiatives.

**Financial Highlights**

Beneficient reported revenues of $4.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a substantial improvement from a loss of $10.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenues were $23.0 million compared to a loss of $55.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2024. Operating expenses saw a significant decline, dropping 98% to $13.9 million from $905.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment of $883.2 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

During the third quarter, Beneficient completed its first primary capital transaction and announced a proposed acquisition of Mercantile Bank International Corp., a Puerto Rico-based International Financial Entity. This acquisition is expected to expand Beneficient's capabilities in digital asset markets and related services. The company also reported an increase in investments to $334.3 million, up from $329.1 million at the end of the prior fiscal year.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Beneficient announced a proposed transaction to increase tangible book value to its public company stockholders by $9 million on 8.4 million shares outstanding. Additionally, the company increased its permanent equity by $35 million through the re-designation of certain preferred equity. The acquisition of Mercantile Bank is expected to enable Beneficient to offer an expanded range of digital asset market solutions and companion custody, clearing, and control account fee-based services.

**Management's Perspective**

Management highlighted the company's focus on key steps to prepare for significant new activities in delivering liquidity, primary capital, and digital asset market solutions. They emphasized the potential for these efforts to disrupt and enhance solutions available to large financial audiences. The proposed acquisition of Mercantile Bank is seen as a complementary part of their plan to drive new growth opportunities in calendar 2025.

**Future Outlook**

Beneficient intends to drive new growth opportunities in calendar 2025, which they believe have the potential to generate above-market fee rates. The company aims to further build out its expansive model and benefit from a growing range of trust, custody, and other services provided, as well as the underlying performance of private equity assets held in trust.
