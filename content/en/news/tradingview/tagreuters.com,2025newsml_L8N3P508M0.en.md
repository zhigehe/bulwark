Luxury company Richemont on Friday announced changes to its senior management, with the bosses of jewellery companies Cartier and Van Cleef joining its executive committee.

Catherine Renier, CEO of Van Cleef & Arpels, and Louis Ferla, CEO of Cartier have been appointed, the Swiss company said.

Richemont also said that its chief people officer Marie-Aude Stocker would be appointed to its executive committee.

Former Richemont group CEO Jerome Lambert will step down from the executive committee and board of directors due to his role as head of Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre, the company said.
