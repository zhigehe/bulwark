Merck said Tuesday that Health Canada has granted approval for Keytruda as a treatment for adult patients with resectable Stage II, IIIA, or IIIB non-small cell lung carcinoma.

The approval is for Keytruda to be administered in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and as a monotherapy for adjuvant treatment after surgery, Merck said.

The company said the approval was based on the results of a phase 3 trial, where Keytruda demonstrated "statistically significant" results for the primary endpoints of event-free survival and overall survival.
