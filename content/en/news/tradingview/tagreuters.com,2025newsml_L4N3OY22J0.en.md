U.S. physical crude grades edge marginally higher on Friday, dealers said, as markets worried about tight supplies after new sanctions on Iran's crude exports and threats of tariffs on other countries.

President Donald Trump told Republican lawmakers that he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs as early as Friday, two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters.

Meanwhile, oil and gas traders are likely to seek waivers from Beijing over tariffs that the Chinese government plans to impose on U.S. crude and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from February 10, trade sources said on Thursday.

On the supply side, U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a second week in a row for the first time since July 2024, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.

In refining news, U.S. oil refiners are expected to have about 1.58 million barrels per day of capacity offline in the week ending February 7, decreasing available refining capacity by 160,000 bpd, research company IIR Energy said on Friday.
