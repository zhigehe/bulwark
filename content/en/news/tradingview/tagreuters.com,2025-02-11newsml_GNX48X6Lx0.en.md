NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED STATES NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **Newcore Gold Ltd. ("Newcore" or the "Company")** (TSX-V: NCAU, OTCQX: NCAUF) is pleased to announce that the Company and Paradigm Capital Inc., as lead agent and sole bookrunner, for and on behalf of a syndicate of agents (collectively, the "Agents"), have agreed to increase the size of its previously announced commercially reasonable efforts private placement offering from $12 million to $15 million (the "Offering"). Under the upsized Offering, up to 41,096,000 units of the Company (the "Units") are to be issued at a price of $0.365 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to $15,000,040.

Each Unit will consist of one common share in the capital of the Company (each, a "Common Share") and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole Common Share purchase warrant, a "Warrant"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.50 per Common Share for a period of 12 months following the completion of the Offering.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to fund exploration and development activities at the Company’s 100% owned Enchi Gold Project in Ghana, as well as for general corporate and working capital purposes.

The Offering is expected to close on or about February 27, 2025, and is subject to certain closing conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals including the conditional listing approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and the applicable securities regulatory authorities. The Offering is being made by way of private placement in Canada, in the United States pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in such other jurisdictions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Agents and the Company. The securities issued under the Offering will be subject to a hold period expiring four months and one day from the closing date of the Offering in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

The securities being offered have not, nor will they be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") or any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent such registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This release does not constitute an offer for sale or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, a U.S. person. "U.S. person" and "United States" are as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
