Impact Silver on Tuesday released further drill results from the new Kena Vein South discovery in its Guadalupe silver mine in Mexico.

Highlights include 597 grams per tonne of silver over 2.77 meters and 1,460 g/t silver over 0.55 meters on Kena.

"We are pleased with these additional excellent drill results from the recently discovered Kena Vein South which has now been drilled over 150 metres length and remains open for further drilling. The close proximity of the new vein to current active mine workings has allowed for rapid and low cost mine development," said President and CEO Fred Davidson.

The company is close to completing a new underground access to the vein and it is expected that the first mineral will be mined from Kena South this month, Davidson added.

Impact Silver's shares were last seen up $0.01 to $0.20 on the TSX Venture Exchange/
