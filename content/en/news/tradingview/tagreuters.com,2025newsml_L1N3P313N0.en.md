The dollar index reversed a gain following a stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation print as progress toward a possible Ukraine war resolution lifted the euro.

Treasury yields jumped after a report that CPI was up 0.5% in January and its core measure rose by 0.4%, topping expectations of a 0.3% increase for both. Annualized headline CPI rose 3.0%, above the 2.9% forecast.

In Congressional testimony, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned against reading too much into CPI data while acknowledging that it was not where the U.S. central bank wanted it.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said it is not clear when the Fed can cut interest rates again given uncertainty around the path of inflation and tariffs. Eyes are on PPI and jobless claims on Thursday.

The dollar index gave back gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he had spoken with Russian President Vladamir Putin about starting negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

Trump spoke with President Zelenskiy afterwards and the Ukrainian leader had expressed a desire for peace.

EUR/USD surged past its 21-day moving average at 1.0382 following the Ukraine headlines, reaching a high of 1.0429.

EUR/CHF rallied for a second day, climbing above its 0.9485Â 200-day moving average to a two-week high. Euro bulls, however, remain cautious as reports circulate that Trump trade advisers are working on plans for broad-based reciprocal tariffs and starting discussions with other countries. Europe will digest various inflation reports on Thursday.

GBP/USD surrendered earlier gains and lost ground against the euro. Bank of England rate-setter Megan Greene said it was right to take a cautious and gradual approach to cutting interest rates, highlighting the risk that inflation pressures will remain persistent. UK GDP for December is due Thursday.

USD/JPY posted its best day since December, fueled by rising Treasury yields and bouts of short-covering. Gains slowed ahead of its 55-day moving average at 154.80 and the 155 psychological level with bulls slightly cautious as U.S. shares eased. Japan corporate good prices are slated for Thursday.

Treasury yields were up 7 to 10 basis points. The 2s-10s curve was up about 2 basis points to +26.3bp.

The S&P 500 eased 0.30% amid weakness in the energy sector.

Oil sank 2.5% on higher yields and after weekly data showed U.S. stockpiles rose.

Gold edged up 0.1% while copper gained 2.1% on supply tightness.

Heading toward the close: EUR/USD +0.27%, USD/JPY +1.20%, GBP/USD -0.03%, AUD/USD -0.16%, =USD +0.02%, EUR/JPY +1.49%, GBP/JPY +1.21%, AUD/JPY +1.06%.
