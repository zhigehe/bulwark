AlphaValue/Baader Europe on Monday cut Wizz Air's rating to reduce from add, citing a weaker earnings outlook, among other factors.

"The company has lowered its earnings outlook primarily due to 1/ a greater-than-expected impact from the [Pratt & Whitney] GTF engine-related grounding and inspections, leading to a reduced capacity target and higher unit ex-fuel costs, 2/ further delays in aircraft deliveries following negotiations with Airbus [AIR.PA], and 3/ larger-than-anticipated unrealized [foreign exchange] losses," the research firm said.

Consequently, the analyst reduced its net profit forecast for the 12 months ending March 31 to 134 million euros from 359 million euros, near the lower end of the budget airline's revised guidance range of 125 million euros to 175 million euros.

The EPS estimates were also down 62.8% to 1.3 euros for fiscal 2025 and 10.5% lower to 3.72 euros for the next 12 months. The price target on the stock is 14.65 pounds sterling.
