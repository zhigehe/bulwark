Chinese stocks saw mixed movement on Monday.

The Shanghai Composite gained 0.5%, reaching around 3,320, while the Shenzhen Component dipped 0.1% to 10,565.

Mainland stocks struggled for direction as concerns about a potential global trade war grew following new tariff threats from US President Donald Trump.

Trump announced plans for a blanket 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, set to take effect later today, along with additional tariffs to be revealed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

In economic data, China reported that consumer inflation picked up in January, driven by holiday spending, while producer prices fell for the 28th consecutive month.

Among individual stocks, IEIT Systems rose 2.2%, Shijiazhuang Chan surged 10%, and Sichuan Changhong climbed 6.6%.

In contrast, ZTE Corp. dropped 2.1%, Zhejiang Sanhua fell 4%, and Sungrow Power declined 4.1%.
