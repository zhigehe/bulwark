Heightened uncertainty over the trade tariffs U.S. President Trump could implement means investors need to ensure they have diverse portfolios and employ hedging strategies, says UBS Global Wealth Management's Mark Haefele. "While the delay in implementation limits immediate market impact, the risk of retaliation remains," the chief investment officer says. Within equities, capital preservation strategies could be necessary to prevent losses if stocks turn lower. UBS GWM favors high-grade and investment-grade bonds as a way to diversify portfolios as these offer "insulation against uncertainty." (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)
