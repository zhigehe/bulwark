Heightened volatility will likely keep demand for gold strong and sticky, Maybank analysts say after the haven asset broke above the $2,900/oz mark. They note reports of a shortage of bullion due to rush in gold shipments in anticipation of tariffs. Concerns that the precious metal will become more expensive due to trade restrictions has spurred frenzied shipments to American buyers, they say. And despite the tentative deal that allowed for a delay in U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the dollar's pullback has likely given gold a boost, they say. They stay bullish on the previous metal, seeing the next resistance at $3,110/oz. Spot gold is last at $2,915/oz after earlier touching fresh highs around $2,940/oz levels.
