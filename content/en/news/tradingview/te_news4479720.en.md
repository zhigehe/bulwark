The DAX was slightly down around 22,500 on Friday, coming off a series of record highs in the previous sessions, penalized by the prospect of the United States imposing reciprocal tariffs.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the start of a process to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners around the world, which could go into effect as soon as April.

In the meantime, the focus remain on the earnings season.

Among single stocks, Fresenius Medical Care and MTU Aero Engines were the worst performers, each shedding nearly 2%.
