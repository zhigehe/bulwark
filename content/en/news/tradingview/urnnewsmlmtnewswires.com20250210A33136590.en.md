The AAA ratings of the World Bank and those of other top multilateral lenders would be at risk if the US pulls support for them, Reuters and The Guardian reported Monday, citing a report from the credit rating agency.

"The US is a key shareholder in a number of rated [multilateral development banks], hence it would be credit negative if it materially reduced its commitment to them," Moody's said, according to the reports.
