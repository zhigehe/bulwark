Key points:

* KOSPI rises, foreigners net sellers
* Korean won weakens against dollar
* South Korea benchmark bond yield falls

Round-up of South Korean financial markets:

\*\* South Korean shares climbed 1% on Tuesday, as investors remained optimistic that the effects of U.S. tariffs would be less severe than expected, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks about potentially imposing additional tariffs.

\*\* The benchmark KOSPI was up 25.74 points, or 1.02%, at 2,547.01, as of 0057 GMT.

\*\* Trump said on Monday he was looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.

\*\* Among the KOSPI's top 10 heavyweights, chipmakers, auto and biopharmaceutical stocks account for six of them.

\*\* The top three sectors driving South Korea's exports to the U.S. to a record high last year were automobiles, chips, and auto parts.

\*\* South Korea's exports grew marginally in the first 10 days of this month from a year earlier, as shipments to the United States fell, data showed.

\*\* "The market is pinned to hopes that the impact of tariffs would not be as severe," said Seo Sang-young, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities.

\*\* "Tariffs are seen more as bargaining chips for negotiations, but when they are actually implemented and start to have a direct impact, market volatility will inevitably heighten," Seo said.

\*\* Chipmaker Samsung Electronics rose 0.72%, while peer SK Hynix gained 0.91%. Hyundai Motor added 1.05%, though sister automaker Kia Corp lost 0.11%.

\*\* Samsung Biologics jumped 3.98%, while biopharmaceutical peer Celltrion climbed 1.01%.

\*\* Of the total 941 traded issues, 498 shares advanced, while 372 declined.

\*\* Foreigners were net sellers of shares worth 10.7 billion won ($7.38 million).

\*\* The won was quoted at 1,452.8 per dollar on the onshore settlement platform , 0.10% lower than its previous close at 1,451.3.

\*\* The most liquid three-year Korean treasury bond yield (KR3YT=RR) fell by 2.8 basis points to 2.611%, while the benchmark 10-year yield dropped 4.4 basis points to 2.810%.

($1 = 1,450.5100 won)
