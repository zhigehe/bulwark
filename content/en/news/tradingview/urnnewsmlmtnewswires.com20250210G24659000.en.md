AGC swung into the red with a loss attributable to owners of the parent of 94 billion yen in the year ended Dec. 31,Â 2024 (IFRS basis), from a profit of 65.8 billion yen a year ago.

The losses were mainly due to other expenses, including a loss from selling shares in subsidiaries and associates due to the Russian business transfer and life sciences segment impairment losses.

The glass manufacturer said loss per share was 443.71 yen from earnings per share of 304.73 yen a year ago, according to a filing on Feb. 7.

Sales revenue rose 2.4% to 2.068 trillion yen from 2.019 trillion yen a year earlier.

AGC forecasted attributable profit to grow to 80.00 billion yen or 377.43 yen per share and net sales to gain 4.0% to 2.15 trillion yen for the year ending Dec. 31.

The company expects to pay interim and year-end dividends of 105 yen per share, each, for the current fiscal year.
