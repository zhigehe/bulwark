Super Micro Computer said on Tuesday it believes it will be able to file its delayed annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by February 25, after failing to submit the 10-K report by the August deadline.

The company received an extension until February 25 to file its annual and quarterly reports to avoid its stock being delisted from the Nasdaq.

Super Micro also cut its annual revenue forecast, as competition between server makers heats up for high-performance computers used to train artificial intelligence models.

The server maker, which has so far been one of the beneficiaries of a spending surge on advanced data center architecture that can support the complex processing needs of GenAI, faces intensifying competition from rivals such as Dell and HP Enterprise .

The company expects net sales between $23.5 billion and $25 billion for fiscal 2025, down from its earlier projection of $26 billion to $30 billion. Analysts, on average, expect $24.92 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
