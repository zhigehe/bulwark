U.K. defense and aerospace telecom-equipment maker Filtronic bagged a contract with SpaceX valued at 16.8 million pounds ($20.8 million).

The London-listed group didn't disclose the aim of the deal, but said Monday that it would be fulfilled in 2025 and 2026.

The contract means the board is now confident that Filtronic will exceed current market expectations for revenue and profit in those two years, the company said.

Revenue is estimated to amount to 43 million pounds in 2025 and 41.1 million pounds in 2026, while pretax profit is forecast at 8.9 million pounds in 2025 and 6.9 million pounds in 2026, according to estimates provided by Edison Investment Research.
