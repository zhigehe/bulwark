BuzzFeed said Tuesday it is developing a social media platform with a focus on content that is not shaped by artificial intelligence algorithms.

BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti said this new platform is being "built specifically to spread joy and enable playful creative expression."

"This social media platform will use AI to give users agency instead of stealing their agency," Peretti said, without disclosing other details.
