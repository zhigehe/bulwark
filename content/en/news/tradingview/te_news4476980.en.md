US stock futures climbed on Thursday as investors braced for more earnings reports and the latest producer inflation data.

In after-hours trading, Reddit saw a sharp decline of over 13% after disappointing user figures failed to meet investor expectations.

Meanwhile, Dutch Bros surged 25% following strong same-store sales and solid earnings results.

In regular trading on Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 both fell by 0.5% and 0.27%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up by 0.03%.

These movements followed a hotter-than-expected January consumer inflation report, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates.

However, positive comments from House Speaker Mike Johnson regarding tariff exemptions helped support market sentiment, partially offsetting broader losses.

Looking ahead, traders are focused on Thursdayâ€™s weekly jobless claims and PPI report, as well as earnings reports from companies like Airbnb, Coinbase, and Palo Alto Networks.
