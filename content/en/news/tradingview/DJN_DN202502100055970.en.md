Pharma companies need to undergo cultural changes and become more digital native to fully harness the potential of AI for drug development, says Delphine Zurkiya, who leads McKinsey's generative AI initiatives in life sciences and healthcare. "The companies that are able to shave off quite a bit of time are very digital native and more recent when you look at when they've been founded," Zurkiya says in an interview. "Usually they are cloud-enabled, they store information on the cloud as opposed to just lab notebooks," she says. A lot needs to be done in how companies manage change for pharma companies to accelerate their drug-development pipeline with AI, she adds. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)
