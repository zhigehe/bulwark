Malaysia's economy grew 5% in the fourth quarter of 2024 from a year earlier, slower than in the previous three-month period, the government and central bank said on Friday.

The reading was above both an official advance estimate and analysts' forecast in a Reuters poll of a 4.8% expansion, but softer than the 5.4% expansion in the previous quarter.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy contracted 1.1%, compared to a revised 1.9% rise in the third quarter.

Bank Negara Malaysia said activity in the October-December period was driven by domestic demand, strong investment activity, and sustained household spending.

"However, growth was weighed down by contraction in the commodities sector following lower oil palm output as well as the continued decline in oil production." the central bank said in a statement.

Full-year growth in 2024 was 5.1% compared to 3.6% in 2023.

That was in line with an advance estimate of 5.1% and the government's forecast range of 4.8% to 5.3%.

The government and central bank have forecast the economy will grow between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2025.

The annual headline inflation rate moderated to 1.8% during the fourth quarter of 2024 from 1.9% in the third quarter, while full-year inflation fell to 1.8% from 2.5% in 2023, the central bank said.

The central bank held its key interest rate (MYINTR=ECI) unchanged at 3.00% last month, where it has been since May 2023, citing strong economic growth and steady inflation, while warning of potential currency volatility.
