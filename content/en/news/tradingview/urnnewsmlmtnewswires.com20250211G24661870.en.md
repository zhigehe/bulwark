Vinci issued non-dilutive cash-settled synthetic convertible bonds worth 375 million euros via a private placement to certain institutional investors.

The bonds, which could be increased to 400 million euros, have a nominal value of 100,000 euros each and will mature in five years on Feb. 18, 2030, according to a Tuesday release. The French infrastructure company will pay interest semi-annually on Feb. 18 and Aug. 18 every year in arrears at an annual rate of 0.45% to 0.70% starting Aug. 18, 2025.

The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of cash-settled call options on Vinci's shares to hedge the economic impact of potential bond conversions.
