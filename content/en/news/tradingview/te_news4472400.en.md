Gold rose above $2,870 per ounce on Monday, near record highs, driven by safe-haven demand after US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, escalating trade war fears.

This move adds to existing metal duties as part of his trade policy overhaul.

Meanwhile, expectations of looser monetary policy from major central banks are growing, with investors anticipating two Fed rate cuts in 2024 despite strong labor data, in line with FOMC projections.

The Bank of England also delivered a rate cut last week with a more dovish stance than expected, while the RBI implemented its first rate cut since pandemic-related measures nearly five years ago.

Central bank gold purchases further supported bullion, with the PBoC adding to its reserves for a third consecutive month in January, official data showed.
