Apple is expected to release its iPhone SE 4 this week, possibly as soon as today, marking its most affordable smartphone with AI capabilities, according to Morgan Stanley.

The iPhone SE 4 will feature a 6.1-inch AMOLED display, Face ID, 8GB DRAM, an A18 Bionic chip, an in-house 5G modem, and support for Apple Intelligence. Analysts, led by Erik Woodring, forecast 3 million units built in Q1Â 2025 and 15 million total shipments in fiscal 2025.

Morgan Stanley expects a starting price of $499, up from $429 for the iPhone SE 3, but noted Apple may phase out the 64GB storage option to increase the entry price indirectly.

Apple Intelligence had a small but positive impact on iPhone sales, boosting U.S. demand by 3.5 percentage points in Q4 compared to the global market. However, Morgan Stanley attributed much of the increase to discounted iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models rather than AI-driven demand.
