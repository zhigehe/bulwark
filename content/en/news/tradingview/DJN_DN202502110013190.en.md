By Michael Susin

Dunelm reiterated its profit expectations for fiscal 2025 after reporting sales volume growth in the first half, and said its chief executive plans to retire.

The soft-furnishing retailer on Tuesday said pretax profit for the first half ended Dec. 28 rose to 123.2 million pounds ($152.4 million) from 123.0 million pounds in the same period a year earlier, reflecting margin growth.

Sales increased 2.4% to 893.7 million pounds, driven by higher volumes.

The company said its performance in the second half so far has been encouraging, and that its pretax profit expectation for fiscal 2025 remains unchanged and in line with the company-compiled market consensus of 209 million pounds, despite the challenging market backdrop.

The board declared an interim dividend of 16.5 pence a share, up from 16.0 pence a year earlier, and a special dividend of 35.0 pence a share.

In a separate statement, Dunelm said CEO Nick Wilkinson intends to retire after seven years in the role.

Wilkinson will remain in the role until a successor is appointed, the company said.
