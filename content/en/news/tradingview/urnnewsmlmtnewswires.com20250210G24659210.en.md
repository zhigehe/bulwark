Nissan Chemical's profit attributable to owners of the parent rose 22.1% to 31.7 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, from nearly 26 billion yen a year ago.

The chemical company said earnings per share (EPS) rose to 230.27 yen from 186.02 yen a year ago, according to a filing on Feb. 7.

Net sales increased 12.6% to 174.8 billion yen from 155.3 billion yen a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company revised its results outlook due to strong third-quarter performance, with sales and income now expected to exceed previous forecasts after reassessing risk buffers and demand prospects.

It forecasted attributable profit to grow 7.5% to 40.9 billion yen or 297.25 yen per share (from 39.4 billion yen or 285.94 yen per share) and net sales to gain 9.2% to 247.6 billion yen (from 245 billion yen) for the fiscal year ending March 31.

It expects to pay a year-end dividend of 70 yen per share for the current fiscal year.
