Far East Hospitality Trust is likely to benefit from more tourists visiting Singapore this year, say DBS Group Research analysts in a note. Tourist arrivals are expected to recover to 17 million-18.5 million this year, they write. With rooms attractively priced at around S$200 a night, the REIT is able to capture the mass market, especially budget-conscious Chinese travelers, they say. DBS has a buy rating on the stock and target price of S$0.75. Units are flat at S$0.61.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)
