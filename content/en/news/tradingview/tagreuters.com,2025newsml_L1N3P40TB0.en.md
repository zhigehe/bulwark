WALL STREET RISES WITH EARNINGS HELP EVEN AS INFLATION STICKS

Wall Street's three major indexes are gaining early on Thursday as investors digest the latest earnings reports and a U.S. inflation report, which came in ahead of expectations.

U.S. producer prices increased solidly in January, offering more evidence of inflation picking up again and solidifying trader views that the Federal Reserve would not be cutting interest rates before the second half of the year.

Still, the benchmark S&P 500 index is drawing its biggest boosts from megacap stocks such as Nvidia , Tesla and Apple Inc .

Cisco Systems , up 4.7%, is also providing a major boost after the networking gear maker lifted its annual revenue forecast on strong AI-driven demand and reassured investors that U.S. tariffs would not have a big impact on its business.

Nearly all S&P 500 sectors are higher. Consumer discretionary is the biggest percentage gainer with casino hotel stocks among the biggest advancers.

Shares of MGM Resorts are jumping 15% after it beat Q4 profit and revenue expectations. Rivals Caesar's , Wynn Resorts WYNN.O> and Las Vegas Sands appear to be basking in the glow of MGM's news as they joined in the rally.

Healthcare is inching higher. However, West Pharmaceuticals , is down ~31% after it forecast 2025 results below expectations due to a strong dollar and a reduction of inventory among its clients.
