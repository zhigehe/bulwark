Access to data is a key challenge pharmaceutical companies are facing while trying to unlock artificial intelligence's potential, according to Chris Meier, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. "The scope of AI usage depends on how much data we have," Meier says in an interview. "The smartest AI doesn't help when you don't have enough data," Meier says. While executives and industry watchers say it is still early days, big pharma is ramping up the use of AI to discover and develop drugs. Their hope is that the technology will help them accelerate and optimize a long and expensive process that often fails to deliver results. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)
