CBRE's business segments showed strong performance. The Advisory Services segment saw a 19% increase in revenue for Q4, driven by a 15% rise in global leasing revenue and a 35% surge in global property sales revenue.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

CBRE made significant strategic moves, including integrating its project management capabilities into its subsidiary Turner & Townsend and acquiring full ownership of Industrious, a provider of premium flexible workplace solutions. The company also repurchased more than $800 million worth of shares since the end of Q3 2024.

Key strategic initiatives include:

* Integration of project management capabilities into Turner & Townsend
* Acquisition of full ownership of Industrious
* Repurchase of over $800 million worth of shares

**Management's Perspective**

Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s chair and CEO, stated, "The fourth quarter was CBRE’s best quarter ever for core earnings and free cash flow with broad strength across our business. We also made significant progress in executing our strategy, positioning CBRE to continue delivering double-digit earnings growth on an enduring basis."

He added, "Our confidence in CBRE’s future has never been higher, as evidenced by the more than $800 million worth of shares we repurchased since the end of the third quarter. Despite the strong appreciation of our shares over the past year, we believe the market is undervaluing our business relative to both its growth profile and dramatically enhanced resiliency."

**Future Outlook**

CBRE expects to achieve 2025 Core EPS of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting mid-teens growth at the midpoint. The company is optimistic about its future growth prospects, driven by its strategic initiatives and strong business performance.
