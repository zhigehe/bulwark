TYSONS CORNER, Va. and PETAH TIKVA, Israel, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cellebrite , a global leader in Digital Investigative (DI) solutions for the public and private sectors, announced today that its Cellebrite Government Cloud platform has achieved FedRAMP High Ready designation by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This milestone, which marks the initial stage in the compliance process, reinforces Cellebrite’s commitment to equipping and empowering its U.S. federal customers with industry-leading cloud security when utilizing the Company’s Software-as-a-Service-based digital investigative solutions.

Since announcing its intent to pursue FedRAMP authorization, the Cellebrite Government Cloud was reviewed by a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), and the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) prepared a Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) which granted Cellebrite Government Cloud FedRAMP High Ready status. This thorough review ensures Cellebrite’s cloud and security services meet the rigorous standards required by the FedRAMP Compliance Regulations. Cellebrite’s FedRAMP activities are supported by Coalfire, a global leader in cybersecurity services and solutions, and leverage the Company’s long-standing relationship with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

“We are proud to reach the FedRAMP High Ready stage with the Cellebrite Government Cloud,” said Erik Sachwitz, General Manager of Cellebrite Federal Solutions, Inc. “Today’s milestone represents another important step that Cellebrite has taken over the past year to further expand the scope of our relationships with U.S. Federal agencies. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our U.S. Federal customers with trusted, secure and innovative cloud-ready solutions that help modernize their investigative workflows and accelerate their missions.”

Cellebrite’s Government Cloud will initially support Cellebrite Inseyets, the Company’s market-leading digital forensics solution, with the scalability and security to address the requirements of U.S. Federal agencies as well as other national, regional and local public safety customers around the globe. Future offerings on the Cellebrite Government Cloud include the Company’s leading secure, scalable cloud solution, Cellebrite Guardian, for digital evidence sharing, review and management. Guardian delivers greater operational efficiencies, supports better collaboration and helps advance missions, strengthening the overall chain of custody.
