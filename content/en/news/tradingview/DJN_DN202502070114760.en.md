By Stephen Nakrosis

The Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission is offering $200 million of bonds to refund and repurchase existing debt.

The commission will sell Power Project Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2025 in connection with the Prairie State Project, a coal-fired, steam-electric generating facility located in southwestern Illinois owned by a group of public utilities, according to documents posted Friday on MuniOS.

The securities are expected to price Feb. 25, and settlement is scheduled for March 6.

Proceeds will be used to refund and defease all of the outstanding Power Project Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2015 A, and purchase through a tender offer the outstanding Series 2016 A securities. The bonds targeted for tender mature from December 2032 through December 2040, and carry interest rates of 4% or 5%. Money from the sale will also be used to pay issuance costs.

The invitation to tender bonds is slated to expire on Feb. 21 at 5 p.m. ET, which is subject to change, according to the documents.

The commission has applied for ratings from Moody's and Fitch Ratings.

BofA Securities is listed as the offering's lead manager.
