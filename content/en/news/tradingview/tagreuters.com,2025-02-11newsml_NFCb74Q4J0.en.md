WaterField Designs introduces the Shinjuku Brief, a contemporary take on the classic briefcase crafted for professionals navigating between their urban commute and office life. Handcrafted from lightweight X-Pac® Canvas and full-grain leather, the compact new briefcase joins the company's Shinjuku Collection of bags that nimbly navigate crowds and sport convenient access to tech and necessities.

San Francisco, California--(Newsfile Corp. - February 11, 2025) - San Francisco's WaterField Designs introduces the Shinjuku Laptop Brief in three sizes featuring X-Pac® Canvas or traditional waxed canvas and full-grain leather for a casual to professional appeal. Named after Tokyo's bustling Shinjuku district - home to the world's busiest transit hub - the slim, lightweight briefcase features strategic quick-access pockets that help professionals navigate bustling cities, busy trains, and tight spaces on their way to the office.

The Shinjuku Laptop Brief, available in lightweight X-Pac Canvas or traditional waxed canvas, each with full-grain leather details.

"The Shinjuku Brief is the first of several upcoming additions to our Shinjuku Collection, inspired by the dynamic efficiency of Tokyo's Shinjuku Metro Station, where millions seamlessly navigate complex connections daily," said owner Gary Waterfield. "We designed the briefcase with a slender profile to deftly negotiate crowded spaces and intuitive magnetic pockets for quick access on commutes. Offered in a choice of materials, including ultra-lightweight waterproof X-Pac® Canvas, the new laptop briefcase combines durability with classic styling."

The Shinjuku Laptop Brief includes built-in padded compartments for both a laptop and a tablet while maintaining a slim, lightweight profile focused on maneuverability. Magnetic closures on front and back pockets allow easy access on the go while keeping items secure. The rear pocket conveniently stows items commuters frequently reach for like metro cards, earbuds, and smartphones. A clever tab allows for a quick opening, and the strong magnet automatically closes the pocket. Two pleated magnetic front pockets store additional regularly retrieved items, while tech and other work gear remain secured with waterproof zippers inside the main compartment.

X-Pac® Canvas blends water-resistant and highly durable X-Pac® with canvas for a soft feel. The ultra-lightweight, high-performance textile makes the workbag comfortable to carry on long commutes. Also available in waxed canvas - for an old-school, been-around- the-world look - each briefcase features full-grain leather detailing. A bright gold, honeycomb liner lights up the bag's interior and pockets, eliminating the need to dig around for items in dark corners.

**Features:**

* A rear, magnetic pocket for frequently accessed items like metro cards, ID, and smartphone is easy to reach while wearing the bag and keeps items close to the body for security. A small tab facilitates a quick open, and the magnetic zipper closes automatically.
* Two expandable front pockets, sized to fit personal effects like wallet, sunglasses, mints, etc., close with full-grain leather pocket flaps secured with rare-earth magnets.
* A slim main compartment features two built-in sleeves for a laptop and tablet, each padded with fleece and firm foam on one side. Cut-out corners on the laptop sleeve facilitate in-case charging.
* Three pen slots and two internal pockets, one with a built-in key tether, add organization to the interior of the brief.
* A collapsible internal water bottle sleeve in the main compartment holds a 2.5- to 3-inch water bottle (dependent on brief size chosen) upright to prevent leakage.
* A bright gold, water-resistant liner illuminates the interior making contents simple to locate.
* Firm foam padding along the bottom and part way up all four sides of the brief creates a padded boot for added protection and structure.
* Three carry options: leather-lined handles; rolling suitcase pass-through; and the Supreme Shoulder Strap engineered to distribute weight evenly, featuring a shoulder pad with dual surfaces - a grippy side to keep the bag stable while walking and a smooth side to slide the bag forward to access contents.
* Constructed from X-Pac® Canvas, a lightweight, highly durable, water-resistant textile or traditional waxed canvas, each with full-grain leather details.
