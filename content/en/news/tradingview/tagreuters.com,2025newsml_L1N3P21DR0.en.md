Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said on Tuesday that monetary policy is in a good place and what happens next will be driven by economic data.

"Monetary policy is right where it should be" and "anything further down the road depends on how the data evolves," Williams told reporters after an event at Pace University.

Current monetary policy is restrictive, which is appropriate given the still-high level of inflation, he noted.

Williams also said he was less worried about inflation expectations becoming unmoored and that it is unclear whether the current broad uncertainty is weighing on economic activity in an identifiable fashion.
