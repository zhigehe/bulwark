MARKET SNAPSHOT

U.S. stocks ended mostly lower and Treasury yields were higher as markets braced for a long period of unchanged interest rates. Oil prices fell after U.S. inventories posted a large build. The dollar fell and gold was lower.

MARKET WRAPS

EQUITIES

U.S. stocks were mostly lower after the first inflation readout for 2025 stoked investors' concerns about stubborn price pressures and reignited worries that interest rates might not come down as expected.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%, the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite edged higher by less than 0.1%.

The consumer-price index rose 3% in January from a year earlier, an acceleration from December's rate, and faster than economists had expected. The WSJ Dollar Index and Treasury yields rose after the CPI figures were released, while stocks turned lower.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, told senators that the inflation report offers the latest reminder that the central bank has made "great progress" toward bringing inflation closer to its goal but, "we're not quite there yet."

Earlier Wednesday, Chinese shares closed higher. Property and semiconductor stocks led the gains.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.9% higher, the Shenzhen Composite Index rose 1.3%, and the ChiNext Price Index gained 1.8%. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed 2.6% higher, supported by tech and property stocks.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.4%, supported by a weaker yen that boosted expectations of better earnings potential for export-driven companies.

Stocks in Australia rose, as the S&P/ASX 200 Benchmark Index increased 0.6%. The blue-chip S&P/ASX 20 Index, which includes the country's major banks and iron-ore miners, added 0.9%.

New Zealand's NZX-50 closed flat, rallying into the close. Infrastructure and logistics stocks were mixed.

COMMODITIES

Oil futures posted their first loss in four sessions after official U.S. data revealed a third straight weekly climb in U.S. crude supplies.

Worries about the U.S. economy, driven by a sharp rise in consumer prices in January, as well as news that helped ease concerns surrounding Russian crude supplies, also contributed to oil's price decline.

West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery fell 2.7% to settle at $71.37 a barrel. April Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped 2.4% to $75.18 a barrel.

A Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, or end of the war, could be bearish for oil if Trump pushes for an immediate removal of all sanctions on the Russian energy industry, said Tyler Richey, co-editor at Sevens Report Research. Also, geopolitical stability may "largely extinguish the still simmering 'fear bid' in the oil market."

Front-month Comex February gold lost 0.1% to $2909.00 â€” lower for two consecutive sessions.

TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES

Inflation Heated Up in January, Freezing the Fed

Consumer prices rose briskly in January, extending a recent pattern of price increases at the start of the year that likely derails the prospect for Federal Reserve rate cuts anytime soon.

The Labor Department said Wednesday that prices rose last month 0.5% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was the largest monthly increase since August 2023 and well ahead of economists' expectations for a milder increase of 0.3%.

The gain pushed 12-month inflation to 3% in January. That marked a pickup from December, when prices rose 2.9%.

Trump Advisers Eye Bank Regulator Consolidation After Targeting CFPB

Trump administration officials are discussing plans to curtail and combine the power of banking regulators-without Congress's input.

In recent discussions, Trump advisers and allies have examined whether it is possible to collapse the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. into the Treasury Department, according to people familiar with the matter. They have also discussed combining the FDIC's regulatory role with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under Treasury.

The Trump administration has already taken aim at one financial regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. President Trump over the weekend installed Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, as acting head of the CFPB. Alongside the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, Vought moved at breakneck speed to close the CFPB headquarters and order staff to halt work.

Cisco's Earnings Beat Expectations. Its Guidance Was Upbeat.

Cisco Systems second-quarter earnings and revenue came in higher than Wall Street expected.

The networking company reported earnings of 94 cents a share on revenue of $14 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 91 cents a share from revenue of $13.9 billion.

Cisco's earnings rose from last year's 87 cents a share, while revenue increased from $12.8 billion.

Robinhood Stock Jumps As Earnings Blow Past Forecasts

Robinhood's fourth-quarter earnings blew past Wall Street estimates, and its shares jumped in reaction.The brokerage firm reported diluted earnings per share of $1.01 compared with analyst forecasts of 42 cents, according to FactSet. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Robinhood had reported earnings of 3 cents.

Quarterly revenue hit $1.01 billion, up 115% year over year, according to the company. Analysts had expected $934 million in revenue for the latest quarter.

Shares of Robinhood surged 6% in after-hours trading Wednesday following the earnings report.

The company reported record net income of $916 million and said it benefited from a $369 million deferred tax benefit (equivalent to 41 cents of diluted EPS).

Chevron to Lay Off Up to 20% of Workers. Why the Oil Industry Is Slimming Down.

Chevron will lay off 15% to 20% of its workers, or roughly 6,000 to 8,000 people, the company told employees on Wednesday. A top company executive told Barron's that the layoffs are part of a larger cost-cutting initiative, and are not a sign of broader problems at the company.

"This is about us continuing to improve and positioning us to accelerate all the cash-generation that you've heard us talk about here over the past few years," said Vice Chairman Mark Nelson in an interview. The layoffs will happen all over the world, and in all of the company's major divisions, Nelson said.

At the same time, the company has been boosting its returns to shareholders, by ramping up dividends and share-buybacks. In the past two years, Chevron has bought back $30 billion worth of its own shares, cutting its share count by about 10%. It has repeatedly raised its dividend too, and the stock now has a dividend yield of 4.4%.

CVS Health Stock Jumps on Earnings Beat and Solid Guidance. 'Phew!' Says One Analyst.

CVS Health investors were breathing a big sigh of relief Wednesday after the healthcare services behemoth reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Shares were up sharply on hopes that the company's atrociously bad 2024 was now firmly in the rearview, and that recovery for its troubled health insurance division was on the way.

The stock was up 14.8% Wednesday morning, on track for its largest one-day percent increase since 2008.
