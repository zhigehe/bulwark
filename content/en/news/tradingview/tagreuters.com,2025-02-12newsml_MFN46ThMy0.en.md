Better Collective’s North American brands Action Network and Playmaker HQ ramped up offerings during the final weeks leading to the Super Bowl, with more than 8 million wagers placed through its QuickSlip product and live events including Shaquille O’Neal, Marshawn Lynch and Angel Reese.

Since 2021, Better Collective has established a leading position within US sports media and betting. Through strategic acquisitions of impactful brands such as Action Network, Playmaker HQ, Yardbarker and more, Better Collective has built a strong and diversified position in the market, providing innovative technologies and engaging and entertaining content formats for sports fans, as well as attractive platforms for advertisers to engage with millions of fans across sports.

This past weekend, one of the world’s biggest sporting events arrived with the Super Bowl in New Orleans. The game’s enormous viewership, which averaged an all-time record 127.7 million viewers across television and streaming platforms on Sunday according to Nielsen, pairs with high betting activity, with 1.5 bUSD wagered through regulated sportsbooks in the US on the 2024 Super Bowl, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA).

Better Collective and its brands are strategically aligned to be involved in both the coverage of the game and the wagering on it, providing a benefit to fans, bettors, and partners alike. Through Better Collective’s brands, the digital sports media group is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in exciting its audience with top content and supporting its partners acquiring customers and engaging with the fans.

Action Network, one of Better Collective’s brands and a leading source for sports betting news, information, and analysis from top experts, has grown alongside the rise in sports betting and provided users with more ways to gamble. Through innovative features like QuickSlip, Action Network is powering efficient wagering for more types of bettors and providing immense value for its partners around the Super Bowl and beyond. QuickSlip allows Action Network fans and users to place their bets instantly on sportsbook apps with one click. After clicking a link in an Action Network article or a pick on the Action App, users can pick from one of Action Network’s experts or a line on the scores page featuring QuickSlip and the bet slip will be filled out automatically. In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, more than 8 million wagers were placed through the QuickSlip feature. In 2024, Better Collective’s US properties, including Action Network, powered more than 50 million wagers via QuickSlip, proving to be both popular among users and beneficial for the company’s sportsbook partners.

In addition to QuickSlip, Action Network’s content around the Super Bowl focused on providing a deep level of analysis for the fans. Over the course of the last few weeks, Action Network had 15 podcasts/live shows, 12+ hours of produced programming, 100+ betting articles, 3M+ tracked bets on the Action App, 15+ newsletters, and coverage spanning hundreds of markets, all for the Super Bowl.

Better Collective was also active and present in Super Bowl host city New Orleans, where its brand Playmaker HQ hosted “Pod Party at Playmaker Yards” on Saturday, February 8. The event included live podcast recordings of Playmaker HQ’s chart-topping sports shows, headlined by Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal’s *Big Podcast with Shaq*. Former American Football All-Pro running back Marshawn Lynch also recorded his *Da Get Got Pod* alongside cohost, former American football fullback, Mike Robinson, and a special surprise podcast by WNBA star Angel Reese recording the popular *Unapologetically Angel* show. Each show featured special guests from the worlds of sports and entertainment, including Shane Gillis, Ryan Clark, Oz the Mentalist, Cam Newton, and DeSean Jackson, while attendees enjoyed celebrity meet-and-greets, interactive games and activations, musical performances, and comedy acts throughout the day. Throughout the event, Better Collective and Playmaker HQ had partnered with well-known consumer brands such as presenting sponsor Tommy John, as well as additional sponsors Dove, The General, Draftkings, Morgan + Morgan, and Lunazul.

Marc Pedersen, North America CEO at Better Collective, said:

“The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are some of the most active and impactful periods in the North American sports calendar. During this exciting time, our brands and platforms consistently lead the way in delivering engaging and dynamic content that captivates fans while supporting our partners to grow their business through effective customer acquisition and enhanced brand activation. Combined with a prominent presence in New Orleans for the game, including strong activations, overall the team delivered excellently throughout the Super Bowl weeks.”
