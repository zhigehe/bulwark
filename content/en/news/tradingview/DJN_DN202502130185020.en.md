The Singapore dollar is steady against its U.S. counterpart in the Asian session, supported by some signs of relief. Key parts of the U.S. PPI released overnight, which are tied to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, were softer, Maybank analysts say in a FX Research & Strategy report. They note that the reading eased some worries over inflationary pressures as well. In addition, U.S. President Trump only plans to consider reciprocal tariffs after Apr. 1, the analysts add. USD/SGD is little changed at 1.3438. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
