By Hannah Erin Lang

Robinhood posted a sharp jump in quarterly profit, fueled by a flurry of post-election trading activity.

* The online brokerage reported late Wednesday that net income totaled $916 million, or $1.01 a share, last quarter, up from $30 million, a year earlier.
* Analysts were expecting a per-share profit of 42 cents, according to FactSet.
* Revenue more than doubled, to $1.01 billion. That total also exceeded analysts' estimates.
* Revenue on customer trades tripled to $672 million, more than half of which came from cryptocurrency trades.

The stock jumped 15% in premarket trading.

Robinhood was a big winner of the "Trump bump:" the end-of-year market rally marked by investors' hopes that Donald Trump's election victory would usher in a more business-friendly administration.
