Brazilian maker of household cleaning products Bombril said it filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after it decided to recognize some 2.3 billion reais ($398 million) in tax losses amid a court battle with the government.

Bombril , known locally for its famous steel sponge, said the dispute is related to the alleged lack of tax payments on trades with foreign debt securities held by the company and its then parent firm between 1998 and 2001.

In a securities filing, Bombril said the risk of losing these court disputes threatened its recent positive results, exposing the firm to risks such as the early maturity of debts.

"With the bankruptcy protection, the company will be able to maintain its operational capacity and better restructure its liabilities," Bombril said, adding it expects a quick process and with the least impact possible to creditors' rights and operational activities.
