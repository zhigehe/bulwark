S2 Resources began an air core drilling program at the O'Connors gold-arsenic anomaly in the western part of the Yeungroon project in the Victorian goldfields, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The 5,000-meter program aims to better define the extent and location of "hotspots" within the extensive gold-arsenic anomalous corridors identified by previous air core drilling, per the filing.

Yeungroon is one of the three new projects in the Central Victorian Goldfields recently acquired from Toronto-listed Valkea Resources. S2 Resources has the right to earn an 80% interest in the three projects.

The Australian miner's shares rose 6% in recent trade.
