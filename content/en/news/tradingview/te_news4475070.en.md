The S&P 500 hovered near the flatline in the afternoon trading, the Nasdaq 100 dipped 0.2% on tech losses, and the Dow edged slightly higher.

Investors weighed Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious stance on interest rates and the impact of President Trump’s new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which fueled trade war concerns.

Powell reiterated that the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, citing a strong economy and stubborn inflation above 2%.

Steel and aluminum stocks rose, with Cleveland-Cliffs up 4.1%, Nucor gaining 0.7%, and Alcoa adding 1.8%.

Apple climbed over 2.5% on reports of an AI partnership with Alibaba, while Tesla fell 5.7%.

Meanwhile, the earnings season continues with shares of Coca-Cola rising more than 3.5% after the company's sales topped estimates.

Investors are now focused on Wednesday’s CPI report, which could influence expectations for the Fed’s next move.
