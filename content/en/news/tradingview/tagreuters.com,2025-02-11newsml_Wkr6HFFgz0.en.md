Vår Energi ASA

Sandnes, Norway, 11 February 2024: Today, Vår Energi (OSE: VAR, the "Company") reports financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Vår Energi is also hosting its Capital Markets Update (CMU) to present an update on its strategy for growth, resilience and value creation towards 2030 through sustained high production, strong cash flow generation and increased dividends.

"Vår Energi reports strong operational and financial results for 2024. This is supported by production within guidance and capital and operating expenditure below the guided range due to cost discipline and efficient operations. With three new projects on stream in 2024, Johan Castberg nearing start-up and the Balder Jotun FPSO on track for production by the end of the second quarter, we continue to deliver high value growth. This is reflected in shareholder distributions for 2024 of around USD 1.1 billion and raised first quarter 2025 dividend guidance of USD 300 million," said Nick Walker, the CEO of Vår Energi.

"2025 is transformational for Vår Energi, with production set to grow above 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd) in the fourth quarter and remain at around 400 kboepd in 2026. Towards 2030, we plan to organically sustain production of 350 to 400 kboepd by capturing the value upside in our high-quality assets with a net resource potential of over 3 billion barrels," Mr Walker continued.

"To deliver, we are stepping up the pace and activity level, moving more than 25 early-phase projects forward faster, with a target to sanction up to eight projects in 2025. Furthermore, we are accelerating infill drilling, increasing exploration activity, while becoming carbon neutral in our operational emissions by the end of this decade. We are delivering significant value creation through reduced costs, a high quality and flexible investments program, and incremental improvements throughout our operations. This provides resilience in a volatile business environment, strong cash flow generation and strengthens our long-term shareholder distribution capacity, as reflected in a raised dividend policy to 25 to 30% of cash flow from operations after tax," Mr Walker ends.
