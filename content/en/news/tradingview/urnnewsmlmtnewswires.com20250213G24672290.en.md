Australian shares were flat with a positive bias on Thursday's close, as markets ignored higher-than-expected US CPI data after President Trump said he would start negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index changed little to close at 8,540.

The US core consumer price index increased 0.4% in January, showing that the Central Bank would continue keeping policy restrictive, Bloomberg reported.

Strategists said global markets brushed aside Wednesday's inflation data, which dashed hopes for interest rate cuts, turning attention to President Trump's Ukraine peace talks with Russia, the report said.

On the domestic front, Australian household spending was flat last month as consumers took a breather from a spending spree in the final quarter of 2024, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a report.

Australian consumers' expected inflation rate rose by 0.6% in February to reach 4.6%, marking its highest level since April 2024, according to a monthly survey by the Melbourne Institute.

In company news, Temple & Webster Group reported Thursday that its earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.072 from AU$0.033 per diluted share a year earlier. Shares of the company rose 14% at market close, its highest since mid-2021.

Insurance Australia Group reported Thursday that its cash earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.26, from AU$0.17 per diluted share a year earlier. Shares of the group fell 13% at market close.

Sigma Healthcare's shares rose 5% on close after it started trading on the Australian Securities Exchange again on Thursday following its merger with Chemist Warehouse. The merged entity now has a market capitalization of around AU$31.84 billion, according to the Australian bourse.
