CBOT grains are lower after today's WASDE report left much of the agency's domestic outlook unchanged from the previous month--even if world projections showed a tighter story for both corn and soybeans. "The trade was disappointed not to see U.S. corn export revisions," says Terry Reilly of Marex, although he notes that an unchanged outlook for soybean oil consumption by the biofuels industry, at 13.6 billion pounds, is giving traders some hope that the proliferation of renewable fuels will continue. Most-active CBOT corn is now down 0.8%, while soybeans sink 0.3%. Wheat is managing to stay afloat, with that contract now up 0.2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
