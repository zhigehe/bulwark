South Korea's National Intelligence Service said Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek "excessively" and "unrestrictedly" collects information, according to a Monday press release by the spy agency.

The NIS said DeepSeek shares unlimited information with advertisers, stores personal information on servers in China "upon request by the Chinese government in accordance with Chinese law," and collects keyboard input patterns that can communicate to Chinese servers, according to the document.

The app also provides different answers to questions depending on the language used, the NIS said.

The agency informed South Korean government ministries of the "need for security precautions" while using generative artificial intelligence platforms such as DeepSeek, according to the document.
