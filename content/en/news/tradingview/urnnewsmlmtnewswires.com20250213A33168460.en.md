IDEAYA Biosciences said Thursday it has signed an additional clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Gilead Sciences to assess the efficacy and safety of IDE397 plus Gilead's Trodelvy in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deletion, or MTAP-deletion, non-small cell lung cancer.

The drugmakers will include patients with lung cancer in an ongoing phase 1 trial evaluating the combination regimen in MTAP-deletion urothelial cancer, with clinical updates expected this year, IDEAYA Chief Medical Officer Darrin Beaupre said.

IDEAYA said it is currently enrolling patients in a monotherapy expansion in lung and urothelial cancer and is projecting to begin a combination trial of IDE397 and IDE892 in H2.

Shares of IDEAYA fell 4.1%, while Gilead rose 2.2% in recent trading.
