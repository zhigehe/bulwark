Berenberg raised its price target on Equinor to 340 Norwegian kroner from 325 kroner, reflecting strong expectations for the oil and gas company's financial performance in 2025 amid high European gas prices.

"We expect Equinor to generate strong cash flow this year as European gas prices remain strong and the forward curve suggests that this may be sustained through most of 2025," the research firm said Tuesday. "In this scenario, we believe there is clear scope for upgrades to consensus estimates, and potentially increased buyback capacity in the near term."

The company also boosted its production growth targets and lowered capital expenditure for renewables, which analysts anticipate would result in higher free cash flow.

Berenberg reiterated its buy rating on the stock.
