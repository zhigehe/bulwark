Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed 1.1% lower at 21294.86. Chinese equities' strong rally over the past month could be prompting some market participants to lock in some profits now, said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. Adding to that impulse is continued concerns around U.S. tariffs. "Given that U.S. 'reciprocal' tariffs will be expected over the coming days and with trade imbalances highlighted as a key basis for the move, China is clearly in the crosshairs," he wrote in an email. Among decliners, Geely Automobile fell 10%, Xinyi Solar lost 7.2% and Nongfu Spring shed 6.0%. Meanwhile, Sunny Optical Technology rose 3.0% and Zijin Mining Group added 1.5%. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
