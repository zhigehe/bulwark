Small business optimism in the US fell more than projected in January, while the uncertainty index jumped, a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business showed Tuesday.

The NFIB small business optimism index decreased 2.3 points sequentially to 102.8 last month. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting a 104.6 reading. The uncertainty index increased 14 points to 100, which the NFIB said was the third highest "recorded reading."

"Overall, small business owners remain optimistic regarding future business conditions, but uncertainty is on the rise," NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said. "Hiring challenges continue to frustrate Main Street owners as they struggle to find qualified workers to fill their many open positions."

The survey showed that 18% of small business owners reported inflation as their single most important problem, down two points from December and matching labor quality as the top concern.

The net percent of owners expecting the economy to improve dropped five points from December to 47% on a seasonally adjusted basis. The NIFB survey showed that 20% of small business owners plan capital outlays in the next six months, down seven points from December.

"Small businesses may be more optimistic than they were prior to the (US presidential) election, but they are also more uncertain," said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics. "With monetary policy on hold for the foreseeable future, fiscal policy grinding its way slowly through Congress, and trade policy front and center, it is likely that uncertainty will remain a constraint on business confidence over the coming months."

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that policymakers do "not need to be in a hurry" to adjust interest rates as the economy remains strong, reiterating his prior remarks that the central bank was in no rush to cut rates.

On Monday, President Donald Trump signed proclamations raising tariffs on metal imports to 25%. The European Union on Tuesday vowed to retaliate. Mexico and Canada also condemned Trump's move, Reuters reported.

Last week, Trump delayed plans for 25% general import tariffs on Canada, which ING recently said was the biggest supplier of aluminum to the US in 2023. China recently set out a series of retaliatory tariffs against the US, while the Trump administration paused the announced general tariffs on Mexico.
