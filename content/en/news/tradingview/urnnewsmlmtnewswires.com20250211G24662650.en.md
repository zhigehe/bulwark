Power Metal Resources said Tuesday it agreed to sell a portion of its stake in Guardian Metal Resources to UCAM Ltd for 9.2 million pounds sterling.

Completion of the deal will bring the metals exploration company's shareholding in Guardian Metal Resources to 19.2% of the latter's issued capital, or 25,169,772 shares.

Power Metal Resources will use the net proceeds to repurchase a 2 million-pound loan note issued to ACAM, with accrued interest and general corporate purposes.
