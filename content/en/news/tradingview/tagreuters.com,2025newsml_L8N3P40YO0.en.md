\*\* Shares in Kojamo are down 3.2% after Q4 miss as oversupply situation weighs on the Finnish residential real estate group's operations

\*\* Company reports Q4 adj. EBITDA of EUR 64.5 million ($67.23 million), below estimate of EUR 64.8 million as seen in Vara Research consensus

\*\* "While we believe that the recovery in the Finnish residential market is getting closer, the results showed less evidence of recovery than we had initially expected," John Vuong, analyst at Van Lanschot Kempen says

\*\* Kojamo expects 2025 Funds From Operations (FFO) at EUR 135â€“145 million, excluding non-recurring costs

\*\* "FFO guidance points to another year of earnings decline, and rental growth still impacted by oversupply in the Finnish rental market," Barclays says

\*\* Kojamo proposes no dividend for second year in a row, which the broker says it had expected

\*\* Barclays adds that Kojamo's equity story is "on stand-by" until new CEO joins
