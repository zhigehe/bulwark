Eisai's profit attributable to owners of the parent surged 56.3% to 45.5 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, from 29.1 billion yen a year ago as improved revenue was boosted by other income.

Other income increased due to recording 5.9 billion yen as reversal profit of the deposit which it previously received from Bristol Myers Squibb at the time of collaboration.

The pharmaceutical group said earnings per share rose to 160.14 yen from 101.46 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing last Friday.

Revenue grew 9.1% to 601.2 billion yen from 551.3 billion yen a year earlier.

It forecasted attributable profit to grow 1.4% to 43.0 billion yen or 152.50 yen per share and revenue to gain 1.7% to 754.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31.

The company expects to pay a year-end dividend of 80 per share for the current fiscal year.
