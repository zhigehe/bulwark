Nissui raised its year-end dividend forecast to 16 yen per share from 12 yen, bringing the full-year payout to 28 yen, up from the previously expected 24 yen, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The company cited its earnings outlook and financial position as factors in the decision. The revised forecast follows a 12-yen interim dividend paid earlier in the fiscal year.
