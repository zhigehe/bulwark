Indian PM Modi is visiting the White House tomorrow and Bloomberg reporter Josh Wingrove cites the press secretary saying Trump is expected to announce tariffs before then.

Trump had previously promised to announce them yesterday or today. So far he's been very vague but House leader Johnson said there would be exemptions (though maybe not right away).
