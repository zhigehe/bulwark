Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey says on a call with analysts that he's "focusing on innovation that prioritizes bigger and bolder bets," all of which serve specific purposes. This strategy led to a collaboration between Coca-Cola and Oreo, the objective of which was to create short-term buzz and resulted in limited-time drink and cookie offerings, he says. "In other instances, we innovate for lasting impact," Quincey adds. This was the case in expanding the company's portfolio of teas, sparkling waters and juices, which Quincey says are driving revenue growth. Shares rise 4% in early trading. (connor.hart@wsj.com)
