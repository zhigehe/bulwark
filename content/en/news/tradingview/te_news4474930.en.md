The yield on France’s 10-year OAT surpassed 3.15%, hitting its highest level since January 31, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US central bank sees no urgency to cut interest rates, as the US economy remains strong with low unemployment and inflation still above the 2% target.

Investors are now focused on Wednesday’s US inflation report for further insights into the Fed’s next moves.

Meanwhile, trade tensions intensified after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged a “firm and proportionate” response to US President Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain its easing stance, as it continues to address sluggish economic growth in the Eurozone and inflation that remains within projected levels.
