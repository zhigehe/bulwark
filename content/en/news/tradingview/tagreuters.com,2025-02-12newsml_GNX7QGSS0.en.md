VANCOUVER, B.C., KIBBUTZ YIFAT, Israel, and NEW YORK, NY , Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Beyond Oil Ltd. (OTCQB: BEOLF) (Frankfurt: UH9) (“**Beyond Oil**” or the “**Company**”), a food-tech innovation company dedicated to reducing health risks associated with fried food while lowering operational costs, minimizing waste, and enhancing sustainability, is pleased to announce that it has successfully delivered the second order under its previously announced Master Distribution Agreement with Latitude Ltd. (“**Latitude**”).

The February shipment, totaling 16.48 tonnes (T) of the Beyond Oil product, represents an over 50% increase from the January order of 10.8T, reflecting growing demand and strong momentum in the partnership. The payment for the February order was also received in full, underscoring the robustness of the strategic collaboration, which includes minimum purchase commitments totaling US$8.3 million during the fiscal year 2025 as part of a five-year agreement.

Jonathan Or, CEO of Beyond Oil, commented: “The successful delivery and payment of our February order, marking a substantial increase of over 50% from January, highlights the accelerating adoption of our product within the U.S. food service industry. Latitude's strong distribution network and operational efficiency are key drivers of this growth. We are excited to continue building on this momentum as we expand our footprint across the United States.”

The collaboration between Beyond Oil and Latitude focuses on rapidly expanding market penetration in the United States, leveraging Latitude’s established sub-distributor network and expertise in logistics. This partnership positions Beyond Oil to reach all customer levels, from small and medium-sized businesses to high-profile restaurant groups, while maintaining cost-efficient operations.
