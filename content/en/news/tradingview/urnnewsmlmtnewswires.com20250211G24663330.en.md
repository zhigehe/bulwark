The European Commission approved Lawrence Ellison and David Ellison's takeover of Paramount Global, and the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners' joint acquisition of National Amusements, Inc.

The transactions relate to cinema operations in the UK, the US, and Latin America, as well as the global production and distribution of films and television programs, according to a Tuesday release.

The European Union watchdog noted that the acquisitions are not expected to raise competition concerns.
