DoorDash's Q4 results showed that consumer demand continues to be strong, Oppenheimer said in a note e-mailed Wednesday.

Late Tuesday, the food delivery company swung to a smaller-than-expected Q4 profit and beat Wall Street's expectations for revenue. Marketplace gross order value — the total value of all orders completed on its marketplaces, including taxes, tips and membership fees — jumped 21% annually to $21.28 billion, also topping analyst expectations.

"Given DASH's historical [gross booking] outperformance vs. guidance, investors likely assuming stable or even accelerating underlying growth trends," Oppenheimer analysts, including Jason Helfstein, said in a note to clients.

Oppenheimer reduced the company's 2025 and 2026 EBITDA 3% on higher investment for "potentially longer term" gross booking upside, the analysts said.

The brokerage raised its price target on the DoorDash stock to $235 from $180, with an outperform rating.

The company's shares were up 2.7% in recent Wednesday trading.
