European equity markets were expected to open little changed on Tuesday as investors largely ignored the latest tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

The US enacted 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions," raising concerns about inflation and a potential escalation of the global trade war.

European leaders have vowed to retaliate swiftly if Trump targets the region with additional tariffs.

Meanwhile, investors will be focusing on French unemployment data on Tuesday, along with earnings reports from major European companies, including BP, Kering, and Unicredit.

In premarket trading, Euro Stoxx 50 and Stoxx 600 futures were flat to slightly negative.
