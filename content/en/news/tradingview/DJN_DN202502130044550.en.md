Unilever shares drop after a subdued near-term outlook although results were broadly in line with expectations, Interactive Investor analyst Keith Bowman says in a note. Consumers still face a tough backdrop and investments mean costs are pressuring margins, Bowman says. Nevertheless, the consumer group's performance represents a fourth consecutive quarter of underlying volume growth above 2%, according to Bowman. He lists the buyback, ice-cream exit, dividend and pursuit of cost savings as positives. Strong brands and the push to refocus the portfolio and enhance productivity mean analyst consensus opinion remains a "cautious buy," he says. Shares trade 6.55% lower at 44.40 pounds.
