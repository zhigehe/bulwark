U.S. policy overhang is likely to weigh on the Thai baht, BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, says in a research report. Market participants have begun to price in fewer Fed rate cuts after Trump's victory in the presidential election as his protectionist policies will most certainly stoke inflationary pressures in the U.S., BMI says. The Fed has signaled the likelihood of fewer rate cuts compared with the start of the central bank's easing cycle last year, BMI says. Also, imminent rate cuts by the BOT will likely weigh on the baht in the short term. BMI forecasts that the baht will weaken to 34.50 per dollar by end-2025. USD/THB is 0.1% lower at 33.99.
