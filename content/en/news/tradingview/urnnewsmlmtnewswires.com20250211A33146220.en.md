Emerging market (EM) currencies have continued to outperform at the start of this year following the heavy sell-off in the final three months of last year, noted MUFG.

It has been the strongest period of performance for EM currencies since April and May of last year, wrote the bank in a note to clients. The best performers last week were Colombia's COP (+2.1% verus the US dollar, or USD), Russia's RUB (+1.7%), Chile's CLP (+1.7%) and South Africa's ZAR (+1.5%).

All four currencies are also amongst the best-performing EM currencies year to date which also includes Brazil's BRL and Poland's PLN. In contrast, Turkey's TRY (-1.8% versus USD), Indonesia's IDR (-1.7%) and India's INR (-1.3%) have underperformed so far this year.

Latin American currencies and the ZAR have outperformed alongside the rebound in commodity prices at the start of this year, stated MUFG. Bloomberg's commodity price index has risen to its highest levels since May of last year.

The price action reflects some initial relief that United States President Donald Trump's tariff hikes haven't been as disruptive as feared at the start of his second term, pointed out the bank. The decision to delay 25% tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico by a month has brought some relief in the near term.

However, President Trump has since announced he plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum which would hit Canada and Mexico more than other countries.

In addition, Trump also plans to implement "reciprocal tariffs" on all countries that currently impose higher tariff rates on goods imported from the U.S. than on comparable goods imported into the U.S. It remains to be seen how comprehensive these tariff hikes will prove to be and how other countries will respond, but it has the potential to be more widely disruptive to global trade posing downside risks to EM currencies, added MUFG.

EM countries have set higher tariffs on imports in general than developed economies so could be hurt more if President Trump takes action to equalize tariffs including India, Thailand, Argentina, South Africa and Brazil, noted MUFG. At the same time, the release of another solid nonfarm payrolls report supports the bank's view that the Federal Reserve won't be in a hurry to cut rates again.

Recent developments highlight why MUFG remains skeptical that EM currencies can sustain gains recorded so far this year.

The Central European currencies of the Czech Republic (CZK), Hungary (HUF) and PLN have all benefitted from the broad-based rebound in EM currencies strengthening against both the USD and euro (EUR). The relatively hawkish stances of regional central banks are making the CZK, HUF and PLN more attractive than the EUR while the European Central Bank continues to cut rates at the start of this year.

At last week's policy meeting, the Czech central bank (CNB) delivered another 25bps rate cut lowering the policy rate to 3.75% but Governor Ales Michl called the move "hawkish." He emphasized that the CNB board must be very careful about further rate cuts.

The updated forecasts showed only a modest further decline before rates stabilize from mid-2025 onwards. The CNB has moved closer to Poland's NBP and Hungary's MNB in becoming more reluctant to lower rates in the near term.

At the same time, regional currencies could be benefitting as well at the start of this year from cautious optimism related to resolving the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Trump administration is expected to privately share plans for ending the Ukraine conflict at this week's Munich Security Conference.
