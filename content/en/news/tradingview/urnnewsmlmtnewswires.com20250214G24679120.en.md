Segro on Friday reported a return to profit for 2024 while revenue decreased year over year.

Profit after tax for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 594 million pounds sterling, compared with a loss of 253 million pounds earlier. EPS came in at 0.446 pound from a loss per share of 0.207 pound.

The British real estate investment trust's revenue was 675 million pounds, compared with 749 million pounds a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 664.4 million pounds in sales, 481.6 million pounds in net income, and 0.35 pound in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board recommended a final dividend of 0.202 pound per share for the second half, payable on May 14 to shareholders on record March 28. It paid 0.191 pound per share a year ago. This takes the full-year dividend to 0.293 pound per share, up from 0.278 pound in the previous year.
