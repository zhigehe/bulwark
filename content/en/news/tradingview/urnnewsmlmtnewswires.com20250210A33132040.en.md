Meta Platforms plans to start company-wide layoffs, with notifications going out to affected employees on Monday, Reuters reported Friday, citing an internal memos.

A Friday memo authored by Meta's Head of People, Janelle Gale, labeled the job cuts as "performance terminations" and excluded employees in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands due to local regulations, according to Reuters.

The report said workers in several other countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa will be notified about termination between Feb. 11 and Feb. 18.

In a separate memo posted by Vice President of Engineering for Monetization Peng Fan asked staffers to help accelerate hiring for machine learning engineers and other critical engineering roles from Feb. 11 to March 13, despite the layoffs, Reuters added.

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
