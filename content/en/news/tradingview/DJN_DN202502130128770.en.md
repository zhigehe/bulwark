By Katherine Hamilton

Sally Beauty Holdings shares were trading higher after the company's first-quarter revenue beat Wall Street's expectations and comparable sales swung to growth.

The stock gained 7% to $9.80 on Thursday. It has lost a third of its value over the past year.

The beauty supply company posted a first-quarter profit of $61.0 million, or 58 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $38.4 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.

Stripping out certain one-time items, adjusted per-share earnings were 43 cents, in line with what analysts polled by FactSet had expected.

Revenue rose just under 1% to $937.9 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were forecasting revenue of $943.2 million.

Comparable sales grew 1.6% in the first quarter, swinging from a 0.8% decline the previous year.

Sally Beauty said it expects comparable sales to be flat in the second quarter and flat to up 2% in the full-year 2025. Analysts are expecting comparable sales to be up 1.4% in the second quarter and up 1.2% for the full year.
