Following are U.S. expectations for the resumption of grain and soy complex trading at the Chicago Board of Trade at 8:30 a.m. CST (1430 GMT) on Thursday.

WHEAT - Up 3 to 5 cents per bushel

\* CBOT wheat futures rose as major import tenders raised the prospect of greater demand, while traders monitored the impact of cold forecasts in the U.S. Plains, according to analysts.

\* Algeria’s state grains agency OAIC is believed to have purchased around 360,000 to 400,000 metric tons of milling wheat in an international tender which closed on Wednesday, European traders said on Thursday.

\* Saudi Arabia’s state purchasing agency the General Food Security Authority (GFSA) has issued an international tender to buy an estimated 595,000 metric tons of wheat, European traders said on Thursday.

\* The U.S. Western Plains wheat crop saw patches of winterkill on Thursday in areas lacking snow cover, according to Commodity Weather Group, but additional snow is expected to protect most Plains and Midwest wheat next week.

\* The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported weekly net export sales of wheat at 606,400 metric tons, above trade estimates for 200,000-600,000 tons.

\* CBOT March soft red winter wheat (WH25) was last up 4-1/4 cents at $5.78-1/2 per bushel. K.C. March hard red winter wheat (KWH25) was last up 7-1/2 cents to $5.99 a bushel and Minneapolis March spring wheat (MWEH25) was down 3-1/4 cents at $6.18 a bushel.

CORN - Down 1 to 3 cents per bushel

\* Corn futures fell back after firming the previous day on strong demand and tightening global ending stocks released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier in the week.

\* Brazilian crop agency Conab on Thursday said Brazil's total corn crop will reach 122.01 million tons, up almost 2.5 million tons from a January forecast.

\* Rain continues to aid crop development in much of Argentina, while conditions are favorable for fieldwork in Brazil, according to Commodity Weather Group.

\* The USDA reported weekly net export sales of corn at 1,999,100 metric tons, above trade expectations of 800,000-1,700,000 tons.

\* CBOT March corn (CH25) was last down 2-1/4 cents at $4.88 per bushel.

SOYBEANS - Down 2 to 4 cents per bushel

\* Soybean futures ticked down as weather remained favorable in South America and the market continued to digest the USDA's forecast of larger than expected U.S. ending stocks.

\* Showers will benefit crop development in Argentina while conditions will remain favorable for fieldwork in much of Brazil, Commodity Weather Group said.

\* Brazilian crop agency Conab lowered its forecast for Brazil's 2024/25 soybean crop to 166.01 million vs. 166.32 million tons in its previous forecast.
