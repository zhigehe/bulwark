WTI crude oil futures rose 0.5% to settle at $71 per barrel on Friday, after fresh sanctions targeted Iran's crude exports, but gains were limited by US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China and the threat of further tariffs on other countries.

Despite these gains, the benchmark booked its third consecutive weekly decline, primarily due to escalating trade tensions initiated by President Trump's recent tariff announcements against China and other nations.

Analysts expressed concerns that these trade disputes could dampen global economic growth and, consequently, reduce oil demand.

Additionally, a significant increase in US crude inventories, as reported by the Energy Information Administration, signaled weaker domestic demand, further contributing to the week's downward pressure on oil prices.
