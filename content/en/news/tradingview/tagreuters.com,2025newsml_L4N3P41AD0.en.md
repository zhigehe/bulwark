The Baltic Exchange's dry bulk sea freight index, which measures shipping rates for vessels transporting dry bulk commodities, snapped its three-session losing streak on Thursday, as rising supramax rates countered weakness in the larger vessel segments.

\* The index , which factors in rates for capesize, panamax and supramax shipping vessels, rose by four points to 780 points.

\* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index (.BSIS) was up 17 points at 741 points, rising for the eighth straight session.

\* Meanwhile, the capesize index (.BACI) was unchanged at 711 points, holding near its lowest in nearly two years.

\* Average daily earnings for capesize vessels (.BATCA), which typically transport 150,000-ton cargoes such as iron ore and coal, added $1 to $5,900.

\* Dalian iron ore futures snapped a two-day rise on Thursday, as concerns over U.S. steel tariffs and potential India taxes outweighed supply snags from Western Australia.

\* The panamax index (.BPNI) fell nine points to 974 points.

\* Average daily earnings for panamax vessels (.BPWT), which usually carry 60,000-70,000 tons of coal or grain cargo, decreased by $83 to $8,765.

\* U.S. President Trump warned of reciprocal tariffs earlier today, without giving any specific details, but it has traders worried about the future.
