LCL Resources confirmed that it has received unsolicited offers from interested parties regarding the acquisition of its Colombian gold assets, the Andes Gold Project and the Quinchia Gold Project, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The company is in a share purchase option agreement for the assets with exploration and mine development company Tiger Gold (TGC), the filing said.

LCL clarified that it is not engaged in negotiations with any parties other than TGC and that the current binding proposal remains the only offer under consideration.

The board continues to recommend the transaction with TGC and urges shareholders to vote in favor of the same at its general meeting on Feb. 17.
