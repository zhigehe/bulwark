Tri-Union Seafoods, a unit of Thai Union Group, recalled certain canned tuna products sold at retailers including Walmart and Trader Joe's due to a manufacturing defect that could cause the product seal to leak or potentially cause botulism.

California-based Tri-Union said the voluntary recall is out of an abundance of caution following a notification from its supplier. No illnesses associated with the recalled products have been reported, the company said.

The recall includes Trader Joe's and H-E-B-branded products, as well as certain Genova and Van Camp's tuna items, according to a recall notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration website. Chains including Kroger, Harris Teeter, Publix and Safeway carry at least one of the items in several states.

Thai Union Group's North American operations also include Chicken of the Sea. The Thailand-based company has several other brands including John West and Fisho.
