Nvidia has been bouncing back this month, but retail investors aren't driving the rally. According to Vanda Research, individual traders bought just $34 million worth of Nvidia stock on Monday, a big drop from previous levels. It looks like retail investors are getting more cautious, while institutional investors, or "smart money," are stepping in to take advantage of the dip.

That said, institutional option activity hasn't fully rebounded yet. A report from HPBL backs that, pointing to the notable bearish options activity, including a $2.8 million bearish call sweep with a $125 strike price expiring on March 21, 2025, and a $870,600 bearish put sweep at a $130 strike price expiring on February 21, 2025.

Still, analysts are sticking with Nvidia ahead of its February 26 earnings report. Evercore's Mark Lipacis, who has a $190 price target, says Nvidia is five to ten years ahead of its competitors thanks to its AI software dominance.

Bank of America's Vivek Arya is just as bullish, expecting Nvidia to reassure investors about Blackwell and its Fiscal Year 2026 outlook. Meanwhile, retail investors seem to be shifting focus to Palantir , which saw $339 million in net purchases last week, even as insiders continue selling shares.
