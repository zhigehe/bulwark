The Australian dollar held steady around $0.627 on Tuesday, near two-week highs, supported by stronger commodity prices.

Traders appeared to largely overlook the latest tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, who enacted 25% levies on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions." In Australia, a private survey revealed a slight increase in consumer confidence in February, although it remained in pessimistic territory due to concerns over stretched household finances and ongoing cost-of-living pressures.

Meanwhile, business sentiment improved in January, turning positive for the first time since October of the previous year.

Markets are closely watching for the potential start of the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s easing cycle this month, as domestic inflation eases and signs of slowing economic growth emerge.
