DeepSeek has triggered a positive feedback loop in the Hang Seng Index, overriding lackluster fundamentals, says Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at Oanda. The Chinese AI startup's emergence has resulted in positive momentum overall for Hong Kong's benchmark index in the medium term, even though mixed consumer spending and weak factory activity in China suggest deflationary pressures are likely to persist, Wong adds. The Hang Seng Index, whose stocks serve as a proxy for international investors to get exposure to China equities, has outperformed major U.S. stock indexes so far this year, Wong notes. Investors are starting to reprice the earnings growth expectations of U.S. mega-cap technology stocks that are "trading at lofty valuations" over Chinese AI equities, Wong adds.
