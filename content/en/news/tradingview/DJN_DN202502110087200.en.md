Clothing supplier Jerash is looking like a benefactor from tariffs. The Jordan-based company is likely to take up more market share from clothing companies that source from China and are now subject to increased duties, D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker says in a note. Jerash says in a call with analysts it has gotten more inquiries from customers looking for tariff-free partners. "People are looking for production in manufacturing facilities in tariff-free countries, but now it is just getting more urgent and so that is a great opportunity for us," Chief Executive Samuel Choi says.
