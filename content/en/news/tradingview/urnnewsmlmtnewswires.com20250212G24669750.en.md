Morgan Stanley Research updated its guidance and estimates on four banks in the United Arab Emirates to account for recent financial results and its economists' new US monetary policy expectations.

The research firm said Tuesday its US economists now expect just one rate cut in 2025, compared with its prior estimate of three reductions. The Central Bank of the UAE follows the US Fed's moves as the Emirati dirham is pegged to the US dollar.

With their recent results meeting expectations, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank's (ADX:ADCB) price target was changed to 12.70 Emirati dirhams from 10.40 dirhams, while First Abu Dhabi Bank (ADX:FAB) had its price target increased to 15.40 dirhams from 13.90 dirhams.

Meanwhile, a bright outlook on local operations prompted analysts to upgrade Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank's (ADX:ADIB) rating to equal-weight from underweight and raise its price target to 16.20 dirhams from 13 dirhams.

Emirates NBD's (DFM:EMIRATESNBD) price target was lowered to 24.80 dirhams from 25 dirhams as its domestic core operations NIM and higher operations expenditures did not meet expectations. Its overweight rating was confirmed.
