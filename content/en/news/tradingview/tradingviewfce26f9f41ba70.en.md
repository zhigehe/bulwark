S&W Seed Company, a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company headquartered in Longmont, Colorado, has released its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, ending December 31,Â 2024. The company has undergone significant operational changes, including a strategic focus on its core Americas-based operations and the completion of the Voluntary Administration process for S&W Australia.

**Financial Highlights**

For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, S&W reported a revenue of $5.1 million, marking a 38.5% decrease compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The gross profit margin also saw a decline, coming in at 37.1% compared to 42.8% in the previous year. GAAP operating expenses increased to $6.2 million from $5.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The net loss from continuing operations was ($6.3) million, or ($2.73) per share, compared to a net loss of ($3.8) million, or ($1.66) per share, in the same period last year. However, the GAAP net loss improved to ($1.7) million, or ($0.72) per share, from ($6.5) million, or ($2.85) per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

S&W has repositioned itself to focus exclusively on its core Americas-based operations, particularly its high-margin Double Team sorghum solutions. The company closed a new $25.0 million credit facility and implemented an operating optimization plan aimed at aligning its cost structure to drive near-term profitability. Additionally, S&W has commenced a process to explore and evaluate various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Significant corporate developments include the completion of the Voluntary Administration process for S&W Australia, which involved transferring 100% of the shares in S&W Australia to Avior Asset Management No. 3 Pty Ltd. The company also entered into several agreements to facilitate this transition, including a Business Transfer Agreement and a Deed of Settlement and Release. Furthermore, S&W's board of directors has initiated a review process to explore strategic alternatives, including potential mergers, sales, or recapitalizations.

**Management's Perspective**

Mark Herrmann, CEO of S&W, commented on the company's repositioning efforts, stating, "We believe these actions, including the completion of the Australian VA process, entry into a new working capital facility, and implementation of an operating optimization plan to align our cost structure, have dramatically improved the long-term outlook for S&W." Herrmann expressed optimism for the remainder of fiscal 2025, expecting positive adjusted EBITDA for the six-month period from January to June 2025.

**Future Outlook**

S&W has provided guidance for fiscal 2025, expecting revenue to be within the range of $34.5 to $38.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between ($5.0) million and ($3.0) million for the fiscal year. The company anticipates a positive adjusted EBITDA for the second half of the fiscal year, ranging from $1.0 million to $3.0 million.
