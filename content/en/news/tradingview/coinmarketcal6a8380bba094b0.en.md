The Cod3x Airdrop Farming event for Cookie DAO (COOKIE) might influence its price. Airdrops often create buzz and attract users looking for free coins, increasing buying interest. The snapshot on February 10th will capture eligible holders, and farming starts on February 12th. Such events can drive demand and possibly price, as investors rush to meet participation requirements. However, the effect may be short-lived if airdrop participants sell their tokens quickly.
