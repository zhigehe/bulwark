The offshore yuan weakened around 7.29 per dollar, giving back gains from the previous session, as market sentiment remained cautious following the People's Bank of China's latest policy signals.

The central bank pledged to ease monetary policy when appropriate to support economic growth, emphasizing liquidity management and targeted measures to stabilize the financial system.

Despite this, the yuan's outlook remains pressured by concerns over global economic challenges and trade tensions.

The recent announcement by US President Trump on reciprocal tariffs has added to market uncertainty, pressuring the yuan as the US investigates unfair trade practices, with China among its key targets, although the tariffs would not be implemented immediately.

In response to potential tariffs, Chinese producers are diversifying away from the US market, focusing on Europe and emerging markets, which could lead to price wars abroad and economic challenges at home.
