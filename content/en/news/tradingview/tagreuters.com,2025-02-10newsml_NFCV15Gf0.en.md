Headquartered in West Reading, PA, Customers Bancorp is a bank holding company.

On August 8, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced an enforcement action against Customers Bancorp.

After market hours on the same day, Customers Bancorp disclosed a consent order by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Banking and Securities, Bureau of Bank Supervision, stating that "these deficiencies give the Bureau reason to believe that the Bank had engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices relating to BSA/AML Requirements."
