AAC Technologies forecasts its consolidated attributable profit to surge 130% to 145% year over year to between 1.70 billion yuan and 1.82 billion yuan in 2024, according to a Thursday filing with the Hong Kong Exchange.

The surge is attributable to a recovery in global smartphone demand and better operational efficiency, the filing said.

AAC's acquisition of Acoustics Solutions International in February 2024 also contributed to the miniature acoustic components maker's profitability, the filing said.

Shares rose 3% during Friday's afternoon trading.
