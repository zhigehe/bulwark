Asia's middle distillates markets were upbeat as trading activity on the window gained momentum, with more March refiner selling interest also prevalent, though outlooks remained cautious.

Concerns of ample supply and thin demand continued to be the key focus in Asian markets, with some traders still expecting record-high imports into Singapore next month.

A handful of March offers did surface, in line with earlier expectations, as the usual refiners came out to sell their regular requirements.

More northeast Asia-origin offers are slated to emerge in the next few days as refiners more or less settle their contractual requirements first.

Taiwan's FPCC emerged with a March-loading 300,000-barrel 10ppm sulphur gasoil cargo for sale via a tender that closes on Tuesday.

Refining margins (GO10SGCKMc1) closed the trading session higher at $16.5 a barrel, mostly tracking paper market gains.

On the trading window, cash differentials (GO10-SIN-DIF) came under pressure again and flipped to discounts of 6 cents a barrel for the first time since September last year.

Regrade (JETREG10SGMc1) widened slightly and fell back to discounts of nearly $1 a barrel.
