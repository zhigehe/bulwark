The selling pressure on Dalal Street - induced by US President Trump's tariff scare - saw a cut of over 500 points on BSE Sensex, with three stocks clocking nearly 3% fall on February 10.

Here's a quick look at the top underperformers on Sensex:

Power Grid Share Price

Power Grid lead the losing pack of shares on Sensex, down nearly 3.27 percent to end at Rs 269.20 apiece. The scrip saw heavy trading volumes with nearly 3.09 lakh shares which represents over 75 percent of its 10-day average volume.

Power Grid shares have seen losses for the fourth consecutive session now, after the company on February 4 announced its results for the October-December quarter of the current financial year. The state-owned company had reported a strong decline of over 4 percent in Q3 net profit to Rs 3,862 crore.

Tata Steel Share Price

Tata Steel shares fell over 3 percent to close at Rs 133.90 apiece with a volume of 11 lakh shares, representing nearly 69 percent of its 10-day average trading volume. The metal stocks saw strong selling pressure after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25 percent tariff on all imports of steel and aluminium into America. Tata Steel's peers like JSW Steel and Hindalco too saw sharp cuts of around 2% in trade.

Zomato Share Price

Zomato shares dropped nearly 3 percent to close at Rs 227.15 apiece. While the stock has made some recovery after falling below Rs 210 earlier this year, it is still 25 percent lower than its all-time-high record of Rs 304, which it had hit in December last year.

Titan Share Price

Titan shares also saw significant decline. The shares of the Tata Group company fell nearly 2.83 percent to close at Rs 3,327.10 per share. The stock is currently at its lowest level seen in 200 sessions.The Sensex closed 548 points lower at 77,311.80. While majority of its constituent stocks closed in the red, very few traded in green with minor gains. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares closed 1.34 percent higher at Rs 1,962 per share. Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank and TCS recorded minor gains of up to 1 percent.
