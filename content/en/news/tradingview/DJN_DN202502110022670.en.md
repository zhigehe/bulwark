SGS shares rose after profitability last year beat analysts' expectations, and the company guided for further improvements in 2025.

Shares in the Swiss testing, inspection and certification company were up 4.9% at 95.96 Swiss francs in European morning trade, and up 16% over the past year.

The rise took SGS's stock price back to levels seen before the company in January disclosed talks with French peer Bureau Veritas for a potential tie-up which were later abandoned.

SGS said Tuesday that adjusted operating profit for 2024 was 1.04 billion francs ($1.14 billion), up 7.1% from a year before. Its adjusted operating profit margin was 15.3%, up from 14.7% in 2023 and ahead of consensus expectations of 15%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.

The higher-than-expected margin reflects cost savings, analysts at UBS wrote in a note to clients.

Net profit climbed 5.1% to 581 million francs on revenue that was up 7.5% on an organic basis to 6.79 billion francs.

For 2025, SGS expects organic sales growth of 5% to 7% with an improvement in its adjusted operating profit margin of at least 30 basis points.

The results and outlook will be viewed as encouraging, Jefferies analysts said in a note.
