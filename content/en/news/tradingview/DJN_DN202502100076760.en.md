Grain export inspections were mostly higher for the week ended Feb. 6, said the Department of Agriculture in its latest weekly report.

In the report, the USDA said export inspections for both corn and wheat were up from this time last week, as well as for this time last year. The USDA reports that corn inspections for the week totaled 1.33 million metric tons, while wheat inspections totaled 536,217 tons.

Soybean inspections were slightly down from this time last week, with inspections totaling 1.04 million tons. Inspections this time last week were 1.14 million tons, and for this time last year were 1.34 million tons.

Mexico was the leading destination for corn for the week, at 335,257 tons. The Philippines was the top destination for U.S. wheat at 186,641 tons, and China was the lead destination for soybeans at 554,661 tons.

CBOT grain futures are mixed in trading Monday, ahead of the USDA's monthly WASDE report scheduled to be released tomorrow. Most-active corn futures are up 0.6%, soybeans are down 0.2%, and wheat slides 0.9%.
