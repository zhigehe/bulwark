Janel Corp, a diversified company operating in logistics, life sciences, and manufacturing, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 2024. The report highlights significant financial growth and strategic business developments, driven by recent acquisitions and operational improvements across its segments.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Total Revenues**: $51.354 million, increased by 25.1% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from Airschott.
* **Gross Profit**: $15.142 million, an increase from the prior year, with a gross profit margin decrease to 24.7% from 28.4% due to changes in freight rates and the inclusion of Airschott.
* **Income from Operations**: $1.209 million, up from $1.002 million in the prior year period, driven by improved margins at Airschott.
* **Net Income**: $0.659 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $0.276 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior year period, reflecting higher profits in the Logistics segment and a non-cash mark-to-market increase of an equity investment.
* **Adjusted Operating Income**: $2.041 million, an increase from $1.694 million in the prior year period, primarily due to increased income from operations in the Logistics segment.

**Business Highlights**

* **Logistics Segment Performance**: The Logistics segment experienced a significant increase in revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of Airschott, a non-asset-based freight forwarder and customs broker. This acquisition contributed to a 30.9% increase in revenues for the segment, with Airschott adding $1,160 in gross profit.
* **Life Sciences Segment Performance**: The Life Sciences segment saw a decrease in revenues by 14.3% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of orders. Despite this, the segment maintained a high gross profit margin of 84.9%, up from 82.6% in the previous year, due to improved product mix.
* **Manufacturing Segment Performance**: The Manufacturing segment, represented by Indco, Inc., reported a slight decrease in revenues by 2.3%, attributed to increased discounts on manufactured products based on customer volume purchases. The gross profit margin slightly decreased to 53.9% from 54.3% in the prior year.
* **New Acquisitions**: The company completed the acquisition of Airschott in June 2024, which has been integrated into the Logistics segment to expand service offerings. Additionally, the acquisition of ViraQuest Inc. in February 2024 was completed to enhance the Life Sciences segment.
* **Future Outlook**: Janel Corporation plans to continue its growth strategy through organic growth and acquisitions. The company aims to acquire businesses within existing segments or expand into new strategic segments, focusing on companies with strong management teams and stable earnings.
