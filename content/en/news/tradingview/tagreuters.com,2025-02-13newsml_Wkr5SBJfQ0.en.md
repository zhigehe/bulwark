Merus Power Oyj

Merus Power Plc, Company release, Insider information, 13 February 2025 at 2:15 pm

Merus Power has signed an agreement with Skip Wind 5 Oy (the Finnish holding company of Ardian Clean Energy Evergreen Fund (ACEEF)) to deliver a large energy storage system to Riihimäki, Finland. When completed, this energy storage system of 30MW/30MWh will strengthen the operational capacity of the Finnish power grid. The total value of the EPC project is approximately EUR 13 million, and the energy storage system is planned to be completed during spring 2026.

The industrial scale energy storage system to be built in Kaunola, Riihimäki will mainly serve as a fast grid balancing unit in Fingrid's reserve market. The energy storage system will be part of Merus Power's comprehensive maintenance and operation service, like our previous energy storage systems.

Towards more sustainable energy production and security of supply

Ardian's investments in the Nordic countries are managed by eNordic Oy, which acts as a regional renewable energy investment platform. This is the second energy storage system that Ardian is building in Finland as part of the Ardian Clean Energy Evergreen Fund.

“Our goal is to lead the way in the transformation of the Nordic energy system towards sustainable development. We are happy to continue our cooperation with Merus Power. Merus Power is known for its strong technology expertise and experience in energy storage systems,” says Eero Auranne, Chairman of the Board of eNordic Oy.

“The investment supports our strategy in the Nordic countries, where we see significant opportunities to expand the production capacity of renewable energy and to combine energy storage technology to create a more stable and productive energy system. Ardian has a strong position and extensive network in the Nordics, as well as solid experience in financing and managing long-term renewable energy projects,” says Benjamin Kennedy, Managing Director Infrastructure - Renewables, at Ardian.

**Technology for the future**

Merus Power is a Finnish market leader whose products and software are designed and manufactured in Finland. Domestic production and safety are particularly emphasized in critical infrastructure projects, where security of supply and continuity of supply play a key role.

“Our energy storage technology has been developed to meet the constantly changing needs of the market. Our proprietary technologies and software enable flexible and scalable solutions and allow us to adapt to future market changes,” says Kari Tuomala, CEO of Merus Power.
