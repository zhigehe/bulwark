By Anthony O. Goriainoff

London's Heathrow Airport said last month was its busiest January on record as more than 6.3 million passengers traveled through it.

The airport--jointly owned by Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, China Investment Corp., and other companies--said Tuesday that January was the 11th month in a row when it averaged more than 200,000 passengers a day. Trans-Atlantic travel was a key contributor to this growth, with more than 1.2 million passengers using the airport to travel between the U.K. and the U.S. in January, an 8% rise over the same month of 2024.

Heathrow said it supported the U.K. government's show of support for a third runway at the airport, and that it was working to finalize plans and submit a proposal for the expansion by the summer.
