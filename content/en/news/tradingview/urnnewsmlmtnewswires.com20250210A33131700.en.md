Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said Monday that revenue increased to about 293.29 billion Taiwanese dollars ($8.94 billion) in January from NT$278.16 billion a month earlier.

The increase represents a gain of 5.4% month-over-month and an advance of almost 35.9% from a year ago.

The company also said a Jan. 21 Taiwan earthquake measuring 6.4 magnitude on the Richter scale will cause it to lower its Q1 revenue forecast closer to the lower end of its $25 billion to $25.8 billion revenue guidance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $25.36 billion.

Though the company said the quake and its aftershocks left "no structural damage to our fabs, and the water supply, power, workplace safety systems, and operations are functioning normally," a number of wafers in the process of being built had to be discarded contributing to quake related-costs of NT$5.3 billion.

The company said it "making every effort to recover the lost production, and there is no change to our full-year outlook."
