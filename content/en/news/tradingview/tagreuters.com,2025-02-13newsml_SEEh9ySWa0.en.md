TIRANA (Albania), February 13 (SeeNews) - The World Bank Group said it has approved a $120 million (115.2 million euro) development policy loan (DPL) to Albania to help the country strengthen its fiscal resilience and promote green development.

The programme is expected to reinforce government and household resilience, enhance the energy market framework while scaling up renewable energy and energy efficiency with renewables, and protect the environment and reduce Albania's carbon footprint, the World Bank said in a press release on Wednesday.

“This financing will help the country address critical challenges in the energy sector and environmental protection, while also strengthening the government’s ability to manage fiscal risks and better support vulnerable populations,” Richard Record, World Bank acting country manager for Albania, said in the statement.

This programme aligns with the bank's Country Partnership Framework, supporting Albania’s sustainable development, as well as with the country's EU aspirations, Economic Reform Programme, and Paris Agreement commitments, the banking group said.
