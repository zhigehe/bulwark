BP (BP.L) signed an agreement with India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp, or ONGC, for technical services at the Mumbai High field, the biggest offshore oil site in the country.

The British oil and gas company will carry out sub-surface model evaluations, implement system optimizations, and improve reservoir management practices in the field. BP will receive a fixed payment for two years, according to a Monday release. A service fee deal will follow based on incremental oil and gas production.

Technical work at the site is expected to start in March. BP's appointment as the technical service provider for the oil field was first announced in early January.
