Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical subsidiary Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory received approval from Guangdong's drug administrator to amend its drug production license.

The amendment involves the reduction of the "F Building Production Line" at the Xingzhou manufacturing department located at 4 South Chuangye Ave., Mingzhu Industrial Park in Guangzhou, according to a Wednesday filing with the Shanghai bourse.

The F Building Production Line was primarily used for the pre-processing and extraction of traditional Chinese medicine. The adjustment is part of the company's efforts to optimize resource allocation and maintain stable production capacity to meet market demands.
