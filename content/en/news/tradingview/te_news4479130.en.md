Brent crude oil futures rose to around $75.2 per barrel on Friday, supported in part by the delay in President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.

Trump signed his plan for reciprocal tariffs but delayed their implementation to allow for negotiations with affected nations.

Further supporting sentiment was the IEA's more optimistic outlook on the oil market.

On Thursday, oil prices hit their lowest levels since late December amid prospects of lower supply risks and speculation over a potential easing of restrictions on Russian producers after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to talks to end the war in Ukraine.

A rise in crude oil inventories in the U.S., the largest crude consumer, also added downward pressure on prices.

Despite these, crude is on track to post a slight gain this week, the first since mid-January.
