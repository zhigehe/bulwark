Safe Fertility Group's earnings will likely disappoint again in 4Q owing to declining revenue, narrower gross margins and a rising SG&A expenses-to-sales ratio, Thanachart Securities' Siriporn Arunothai says. The company's business continued to slow in 2H last year, likely because of Thailand's soft economy and increasing competition, the analyst says. Its strategy to be more aggressive in marketing with new agents and a business development team resulted in high selling, general and administrative expenses. The brokerage cuts its 2024-2027 earnings forecasts for the company by 11%-17%. It lowers the target price to THB11.00 from THB16.50, with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are 0.5% higher at THB9.50.
