A group of Republican senators on Wednesday proposed a $1,000 tax on new electric vehicle purchases to help pay for road repairs, Reuters reported.

The one-time $1,000 tax charged at the time of purchase would be about equal to what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in federal gas taxes over 10 years for highway funds, according to Sen. Deb Fischer, the lead sponsor of the measure, Reuters reported.
