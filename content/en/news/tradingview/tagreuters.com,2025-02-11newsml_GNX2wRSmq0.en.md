RICHARDSON, Texas, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Mavenir, the cloud-native network infrastructure provider building the future of networks, has been selected by innovative telecommunications operator EOLO, Italy’s largest fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband provider, to supply the 5G SA Core for its groundbreaking Gbps fixed wireless access network. The deployment is among the world’s first 5G standalone FWA networks using mmWave and will deliver cost-effective ultrafast broadband internet access to areas across Italy not reached by fiber connectivity.

Mavenir’s 5G SA Core was selected by EOLO for its outstanding levels of flexibility and interoperability. The Mavenir solution will work alongside the User Plane Function (UPF) from 6Wind, marking an industry-first for interoperability and subsequent commercial deployment between Session Management Functions (SMF) and User Plane Functions (UPF) from two different vendors.

The Mavenir 5G SA Core will deliver both IP and Ethernet data units (IPDU and EPDU), which has never previously been achieved in a live environment.

Stefano Cantarelli, Executive Vice President at Mavenir, said: “This is one of the most exciting and innovative 5G FWA deployments in the world – it is pushing boundaries and using the very best 3GPP-based technologies available to deliver rural connectivity against all odds. EOLO has selected best-in-class partners for this project and Mavenir is proud to be a part of that team, bringing our 5G leadership and commitment to flexibility and agility.”

Guido Garrone, CEO at EOLO S.p.A., added: “Mavenir is an excellent team player. Their 5G Core is future-proofed, and the interoperability of their solution has enabled EOLO to choose the best partners for each element of this challenging and innovative new network. The infrastructures that we are building together will complement fiber coverage, playing a pivotal role in strengthening networks and driving the country's future growth.”

Mavenir offers the industry’s only end-to-end cloud-native network software, with its AI-powered technology enabling energy savings, improved user experience, resource optimisation, enhanced security and fraud protection, and monetization. Its MAVcore® functions are implemented as microservices running in containers, using open APIs to integrate with 3rd party platforms and observability frameworks. This allows CSPs such as EOLO to roll-out services faster, increase efficiency, and reduce downtime.

Mavenir’s full 5G portfolio will be displayed at the upcoming MWC Barcelona, March 3-6, in Hall 2, Stand 2H60. For more on Mavenir’s presence at the show visit  https://www.mavenir.com/mwc-2025/#request-a-meeting-mwc
