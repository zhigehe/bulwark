By Pierre Bertrand

TUI posted an increase in earnings after passengers rose in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, boosting revenue.

The German travel operator said it made 50.9 million euros ($52.5 million) in underlying earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 6 million euros a year earlier.

Underlying EBIT at constant currency--the company's preferred metric which strips out exceptional and other one-off items-- rose to 65.7 million euros.

TUI flew 3.7 million passengers in the quarter, 6% more than in the prior year, helping revenue increase 13% on year to 4.87 billion euros.

It added that winter and summer bookings were both up 2% on year with average prices 4% higher.

Overall for the quarter, TUI posted a narrowed 85.4 million euro net loss for the quarter, compared with a 122.6 million euro net loss a year prior.

TUI backed its fiscal 2025 guidance of 5% to 10% revenue growth and underlying EBIT growth of 7% to 10%.
