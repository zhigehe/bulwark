Forum Energy Metals and Global Uranium (GURN.CN) said Tuesday that they commenced camp construction on the Northwest Athabasca project in Saskatchewan.

In addition, the companies said plans are underway to conduct a Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey and Direct Current Resistivity and Induced Polarization (DCIP) survey on the Spring Bay target along the northwest shore of Lake Athabasca. Geophysical work is expected to commence in March.

Global Uranium has an option to earn a 51% interest in Forum's interest in the Northwest Athabasca project by spending up to $9 million over four years.

"The integration of historical geophysical datasets and legacy drill results gives us an advantage in identifying areas of high potential," said Ungad Chadda, CEO of Global Uranium.

"Refinement of the drill targeting is key to success and the TDEM and DCIP surveys will improve drill target precision of the prospective Spring Bay area," said Rick Mazur, CEO of Forum Energy Metals.
