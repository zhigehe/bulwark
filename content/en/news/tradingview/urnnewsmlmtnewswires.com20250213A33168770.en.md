VinFast Auto said Thursday it delivered 53,139 electric vehicles globally in Q4, up 143% from the prior quarter and 342% from a year earlier.

The company said 2024 deliveries reached 97,399 vehicles, a 192% increase from 2023, exceeding the company's revised target of 80,000.

VinFast said it aims to at least double deliveries in 2025. In January, the company delivered over 10,000 electric vehicles in Vietnam, including more than 4,000 VF 3s and 3,300 VF 5s, VinFast said.

It also delivered 31,170 e-scooters and e-bikes in Q4, bringing the full-year total to 70,977, a 1% increase from 2023, the company added.

VinFast plans to release its Q4 and 2024 financial results prior to market open on April 24.
