Eli Lilly is selling bonds to help fund its planned $2.5 billion purchase of a cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics, Bloomberg News reported Monday, citing a source with knowledge of the matter.

The company plans to issue bonds in multiple parts, including a 40-year note with a yield expected to be about 1.15 percentage points over Treasuries, according to the report.

The proceeds will primarily be used to acquire Scorpion's STX-478, a PI3Ka inhibitor in early- and mid-stage trials, with any remaining funds to be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg reported.

Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
