The Fed has gone from data-dependent to D.C.-dependent, WisdomTree's Kevin Flanagan says. After the central bank cut interest rates by a full percentage point last year, it can now wait until President Trump policies materialize and their impact is felt on inflation, Flanagan says. The Fed's goal is to keep rates at a neutral point, where they put a lid on inflation without destroying jobs. "I think that is going to be a recurring theme that they would like to get to neutral but there's no urgency to get there," Flanagan says. He says the topic may be brought up during Chair Powell's hearings in Congress tomorrow and Wednesday. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)
