SpringWorks Therapeutics shares rose 36% after Reuters reported Germany's Merck KGaA is in advanced talks to buy the company.

Shares were trading around $54.66. The stock is up 16% over the last year and hit a new 52-week high earlier in the session.

The report said the deal for the cancer and rare diseases biotech company could be finalized in the coming weeks. Merck KGaA told Reuters it would continuously assess options and announce any transactions as and when they materialize, while Stamford, Conn.-based Springworks declined to comment.
