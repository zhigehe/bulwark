\*\* Shares of Siemens AG are up 3.3% after it reported better-than-expected Q1 results and confirmed FY 2025 guidance of organic growth of 3-7%

\*\* Group orders, revenues and industrial profit are 5%, 2% and 3% higher than analyst consensus

\*\* "This Q1 result should give investors confidence for potential earnings upgrades throughout 2025 as depressed automation earnings gain momentum," Jefferies analysts write in a note

\*\* Deutsche Bank analysts note strong results in all metrics with free cash flow particularly "very strong" with a 40% consensus beat

\*\* DB highlights that the "main positive surprise" was the result of Digital Industries, which beat profit by 8% and had an organic sales decline of 11% vs consensus of -12%, also reaching a book-to-bill greater than 1x for the first time in 2 years

\*\* "Overall, this is a promising start to the year and we expect the shares to react positively," DB says
