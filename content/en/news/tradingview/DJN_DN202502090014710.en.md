The risk of a direct U.S. tariff hit on Japanese goods could put the yen under pressure, OCBC strategists say. USD/JPY rose this morning, tracking the greenback's gains as Trump announced a plan to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, and mentioned introducing reciprocal tariffs on all nations, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong say. That may suggest that Japan could be implicated, they say, noting that Japanese cars are among the top five most popular in the U.S., and that Japan has high tariffs on rice and meat. USD/JPY was last at 151.93. OCBC pegs resistance at 152.70-80, and 154.30 in extension, with support at the 151.50 and 150 levels.(fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
