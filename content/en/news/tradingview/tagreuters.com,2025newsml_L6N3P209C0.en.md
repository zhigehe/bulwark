The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1030 GMT on Wednesday:

\*\* Balkan telecoms and media company United Group has agreed to sell its broadband provider Serbia Broadband to e& PPF Telecoms Group and other assets to Telekom Srbija in a deal with an enterprise value of 1.5 billion euros, United said.

\*\* The Australian government said it was open to acquiring collapsed airline Regional Express Holdings to ensure its regional services continue, in what would be the first state ownership of a carrier in the country in three decades.

\*\* Merck KGaA , the German healthcare and technology group, said on Monday it is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. cancer and rare diseases drugmaker SpringWorks Therapeutics .

\*\* French retailer Carrefour said in a statement on Tuesday it plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Carrefour Brazil from minority shareholders, boosting its stake in Carrefour Brazil from 67.4% to 100%.
