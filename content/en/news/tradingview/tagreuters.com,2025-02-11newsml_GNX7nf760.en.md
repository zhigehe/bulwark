DENVER, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — CirrusMD, creator of the physician-first care and navigation solution, a new model for virtual primary care delivery, has announced their solution is now available to employers through Aligned Marketplace. Aligned Marketplace, an advanced primary care marketplace for self-insured employers, includes the best and highest quality of clinic-based, virtual-first, and population-specific providers. By teaming up with CirrusMD for a new virtual primary care option, selecting a primary care physician and receiving ongoing primary care just became faster and easier for employees nationwide.

Employers often suggest that their employees select a PCP, yet at times, choosing a PCP can be difficult. Some geographic areas may lack local primary care resources, or physicians may have long wait times for new patients. In fact, the national average for a non-emergent visit with a PCP is 26 days.

In parallel to these challenges, it’s been demonstrated that for patients with a PCP, the total cost of care is lowered. A recent study found the average annual total cost of patients having a PCP was 27.4% lower than those without a PCP(1). Additionally, having a PCP improves patient health via several factors including preventative care, early detection, management of chronic conditions, and increased health equity.

With a focus on establishing greater access to care, the partnership with Aligned Marketplace enables employees selecting a primary care physician to select CirrusMD as their virtual PCP. Through CirrusMD, patients have immediate access to qualified physicians from any location in the U.S., 24/7/365. CirrusMD connects patients with doctors in less than 60 seconds for primary care and a wide range of other health services, including acute/urgent care, pediatric care, women’s or men’s health, behavioral health, chronic condition management and more.

"Our vision is to connect employees and their families with the best primary care experience,” said Patrick Nelli, CEO and Founder, Aligned Marketplace. “With CirrusMD, people who need care can simply and easily chat with their most trusted health advisor — the physician — anywhere, anytime, in less than a minute. With access to high-quality primary care being such a challenge for so many workers, this supports our mission of increasing America's healthspan and lowering total medical costs for employers."

“Aligned Marketplace’s goal is shared by CirrusMD, because we believe there’s a better way to deliver care,” said Jamie Hall, President and CEO, CirrusMD. “What’s exciting is seeing the shift in the healthcare delivery landscape. Today’s more effective virtual care can close gaps that cost money, time, and even compromise health. We’ve created a new model of virtual care that’s connected, aware, informed and always on. By placing the physician at the beginning of a patient’s care journey, there can be fewer delays in care, better management of chronic conditions, and a more proactive care model.”
