Swiss stocks extended their gains on Thursday, with the Swiss Market Index closing 1.85% higher as investors welcomed the latest inflation print and another busy earnings day.

Switzerland's annual inflation rate declined to 0.4% in January from 0.6% a month before, consistent with market expectations. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was 0.1% lower, unchanged from the previous month.

Elsewhere, final German government data showed that the annual inflation rate fell to 2.3% in January from 2.6% a month earlier. In the UK, gross domestic product grew 0.4% month over month in December 2024 after a revised 0.1% rise in the prior month, higher than market forecasts of a 0.1% gain.

"Q4 GDP was stronger than the [Bank of England's] estimate of -0.1%. This print is likely to give the BoE more reason to stay on the cautious cutting path, focussing on inflation persistence risks over growth concerns," analysts at BofA Global Research said.

Over to corporates, several Swiss companies reported earnings results, including telecommunications group Swisscom , food and beverage giant Nestlé and cantonal bank Banque Cantonale Vaudoise .

Nestlé gained 6.22% as it affirmed its 2025 outlook of an improvement in organic sales growth, compared with 2024, steadily strengthening throughout the year. For 2024, the company booked a 1.8% year-over-year decrease in sales to 91.35 billion francs, while net profit declined 2.9% to 10.88 billion francs.

"We were nervous coming into these numbers; thankfully we needn't have been. Results came in fractionally ahead of company-compiled consensus-albeit helped by a slight decline in 2H's marketing spend (although it was up 40bps for the year)-and guidance for 2025 was as expected. So far, so good," RBC Capital Markets noted.

On the flip side, Swisscom shed 3.04% at closing after posting a 9.9% fall in 2024 net income to 1.54 billion francs, weighed down by 227 million francs in integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Vodafone Italia. Revenue stood at 11.04 billion francs, slightly lower than the year-ago 11.07 billion francs.
