Brazilian stock exchange B3 is set to expand its cryptocurrency offerings with the introduction of bitcoin options and futures contracts for ether and solana .

The expanded offerings are set to come sometime this year, the exchange’s CEO Gilson Finkelsztain told local media. Bitcoin futures contracts were added to the exchange in April of last year and have been seeing R$5 billion (around $860 million) in trading volume per month, according to local news outlet Valor Investe.

In comparison, according to Brazilian cryptocurrency market monitor Biscoint, traditional cryptocurrency exchanges saw a total trading volume of R$6.66 billion (roughly $1.13 billion) in the first month of the year.

B3 is Brazil’s main stock exchange where dozens of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products are listed along with equities, bonds, and other financial products.
