Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots as part of its future smart home ecosystem, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

Kuo noted that while the industry debates humanoid vs. non-humanoid designs, Apple is focusing on how users interact with robots rather than their appearance. This suggests that sensing hardware and software will be the core technologies driving its robotics strategy. A full-fledged Apple-branded robot is still a long way off, with mass production unlikely before 2028.

However, Apple has been more open about its robotics research recently, including a paper describing a robot reminiscent of the iconic Pixar lamp. The company is also said to be developing a smart home tabletop robot featuring an iPad-like display and a robotic arm, hinting at Apple's vision for AI-powered home automation.
