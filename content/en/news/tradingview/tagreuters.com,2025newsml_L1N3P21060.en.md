Northwest European gasoline refining profit margins rose by about 27 cents on Tuesday to $10.89 a barrel amid a potential ban on Russian gasoline exports and higher demand outlook in India.

* A total of 3,000 metric tons of E5 gasoline traded, as TotalEnergies sold barges to BP and Mabanaft.
* Another 5,000 tons of E10 gasoline traded which Shell and Sahara sold to BP, Mabanaft and Varo.
* In the Platts window, Trafigura offered a gasoline cargo in the Mediterranean, while Bayegan sought cargoes.
* Indian gasoline demand is expected to rise 6%-8% in fiscal year 2026, underpinned by rising vehicle sales, even as growth in Asian consumption lags growth in supply due to new refinery expansions in the region, industry executives and analysts said on Tuesday.
* Rosneft-owned oil refinery in the southern Russian city of Saratov has suspended fuel production for safety reasons after Ukrainian drone attacks on Tuesday, industry sources said, expecting the plant to resume operations in a day or two.
* Russia's government will examine a proposal to ban gasoline exports, the RIA state news agency said on Tuesday, citing Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.
