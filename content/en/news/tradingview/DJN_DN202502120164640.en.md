Temple & Webster's bull at Citi is largely unconcerned by the Australian furniture retailer's softer revenue growth at the start of the June half. Analyst Siraj Ahmed tells investors in a note that second-half sales are already accelerating from that softer start, when relative growth was hit by the comparative strength of the prior-year period. On-year revenue growth is at 19% in February and getting to the expected 23% growth over the whole of the fiscal half is unlikely to happen linearly, he adds. Citi has a last-published buy rating and A$13.50 target price on the stock, which is up 11% at A$15.79. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
