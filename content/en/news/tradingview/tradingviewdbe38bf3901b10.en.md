Biogen, a leading biotechnology company, has released its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, along with its financial guidance for 2025. The company continues to focus on long-term sustainable growth, driven by its commercial portfolio and late-stage pipeline.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Biogen reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year growth. The GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 7% to $1.83, while the non-GAAP diluted EPS saw a significant rise of 17% to $3.44. However, for the full year 2024, total revenue slightly declined by 2% to $9.7 billion. Despite this, the GAAP diluted EPS surged by 40% to $11.18, and the non-GAAP diluted EPS grew by 12% to $16.47.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Biogen's commercial portfolio showed continued progress, with notable performance from new product launches. LEQEMBI, a key product, achieved global in-market sales of approximately $87 million in the fourth quarter, with $50 million from the U.S. market. SKYCLARYS also demonstrated strong patient growth, with global revenue of approximately $102 million in the fourth quarter.

Revenue from multiple sclerosis (MS) products declined year-over-year, but this was offset by the growth in revenue from new product launches. The company's rare disease segment, including SPINRAZA and QALSODY, also contributed positively to the overall revenue.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Biogen made significant strides in its late-stage pipeline, with several key development programs advancing. The FDA approved LEQEMBI intravenous maintenance dosing, and the subcutaneous maintenance dosing BLA filing was accepted with a PDUFA date of August 31,Â 2025. Additionally, the company initiated a second Phase 3 study for Dapirolizumab pegol in systemic lupus erythematosus and received orphan drug designation for Felzartamab in the E.U.

Biogen's Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million net of reinvestment by the end of 2025. The company has already achieved $400 million in net savings since the program's initiation in 2023.

**Management's Perspective**

Christopher A. Viehbacher, President and CEO of Biogen, emphasized the importance of 2024 in the company's journey towards long-term sustainable growth. He highlighted the continued revenue growth from ongoing product launches and the achievement of key development milestones in the late-stage pipeline. Viehbacher also noted the company's financial discipline, which has enabled a restructuring of operating expenses and a reallocation of resources towards potential future growth drivers.

**Future Outlook**

For the full year 2025, Biogen expects non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $15.25 and $16.25. The company anticipates a mid-single digit percentage decline in total revenue compared to 2024, primarily due to expected declines in MS product revenue, partially offset by increases from new product launches. Biogen also expects its operating margin percentage to remain relatively flat in 2025.
