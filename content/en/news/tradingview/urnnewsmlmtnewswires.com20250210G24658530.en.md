German science and technology company Merck KGaA is said to be in advanced negotiations to buy US drugmaker Springworks Therapeutics.

Reuters reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter, that a potential deal could be completed in the coming weeks. The sources did not disclose details of the transaction and noted that a potential rival buyer may still emerge.

In an emailed response to MT Newswires, Merck said it does not comment on market rumors and that it continually evaluates opportunities that will support its business and market position. Springworks, meanwhile, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
