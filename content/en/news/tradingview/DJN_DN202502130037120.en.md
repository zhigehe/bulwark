The U.K. isn't facing a stagflation crisis, says Joe Nellis, economic adviser at consultancy MHA. The economy unexpectedly grew in the fourth quarter, although only by 0.1%, figures show Thursday, boosted by a strong showing in December. There remain reasons to worry, Nellis says, pointing to shaky business confidence and diminishing fiscal space for the Treasury to meet its spending plans. But fears over 'stagflation'--a combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth--are overblown, Nellis tells clients in a note. "This comparison is overly pessimistic," he says. "Our current economic malaise - and it is a malaise - is a world away from the stagflation of the 1970s."(joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)
