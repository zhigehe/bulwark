Alliance Aviation Services expects the enterprise agreements to be finalized in fiscal 2025 to impact labor and staff costs by 7.5% to 8% as it continues to negotiate agreements with various employee groups across its operations, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

Agreements with Brisbane engineers and South Australia pilots were reached in December 2024, with final approval pending from the Fair Work Commission, the filing said.

In response to recent industrial relations legislation impacting aviation and resource sectors, the company said it is focused on minimizing further effects.

Shares of the company fell 9% in recent Thursday trade and earlier hit their lowest since May 2020.
