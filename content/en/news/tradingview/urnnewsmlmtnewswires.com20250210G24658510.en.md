(Updates to include a statement from Omers)

Deutsche Glasfaser is said to have enlisted Goldman Sachs Group to help raise over 1 billion euros by selling a minority stake, as the German fiber-optic company seeks new investors to finance the launch of its fiber network.

People with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News that the company's owners, Swedish private equity company EQT and Omers, which own Deutsche Glasfaser on a 51/49 basis, are targeting a valuation of more than 10 billion euros, according to a Monday report.

Infrastructure funds and investment firms are among potential investors that are being approached, although discussions are still in the early stages, the sources said. The size or timing of the fundraising is also yet to be decided.

Omers declined, while Deutsche Glasfaser and EQT did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' requests for comment.
