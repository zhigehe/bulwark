Konecranes Oyj

Konecranes has received an A rating in the annual climate program of the CDP, an improvement from A- for the last two years and reflection of the steady progress made in its ambition to lead the material handling industry in cutting emissions, managing and mitigating climate risks and developing a low-carbon offering.

The CDP’s annual program is a globally recognized benchmark that ranks the efforts of investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impact. Companies receiving a Leadership ranking (A or A-) must show their environmental impact and detail the actions taken – and to be taken – to reduce it in line with the 1.5-degree trajectory laid out in the Paris Agreement.

“We are pleased that our ambitious efforts continue to be recognized by the CDP, this time with an upgrade to the CDP A List. Industry benchmarking data offers valuable insights as we assess our climate action performance, and our rating confirms that our work remains very much on track. As a next step we will start looking further into the future by developing our long-term science-based net-zero targets in addition to our current near-term science-based target to halve emissions by 2030,” said Anniina Virta-Toikka, VP, Sustainability, Konecranes.

A strong focus on customers and commitment to business growth and continuous improvement make Konecranes a material handling industry leader. This is underpinned by investments in digitalization and technology, plus our work to make material flows more efficient with solutions that decarbonize the economy and advance circularity and safety.
