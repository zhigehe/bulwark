Golar LNG said Thursday it has agreed to sell its 2003-built steam turbine liquefied natural gas carrier, Golar Arctic, for $24 million.

The deal for the unencumbered vessel is expected to close with ownership transfer to the new unnamed owner by Q1.

The sale of the Golar Arctic, the company's last LNG carrier, marks its complete exit from the legacy shipping business, Golar LNG said.

The company said its other vessel, Fuji LNG, delivered its last cargo in January 2025 and is now preparing for conversion into a Mark II Floating Liquefied Natural Gas, or MKII FLNG at the CIMC shipyard in China.
