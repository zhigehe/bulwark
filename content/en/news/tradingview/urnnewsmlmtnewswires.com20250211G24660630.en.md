Kinetiko Energy said that its second natural gas production test well in South Africa, 271-KV06PT, reached a terminal depth of 631 meters, confirming its sustained gas presence, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

The well has been successfully flared. Further testing is being conducted to determine whether the amount of gas produced from the well is continuing to increase, the filing said.

The first production test well, 271-23PT, which was initially assessed as affected by a geological anomaly, also demonstrated increasing gas presence.

It began a drilling optimization study to evaluate whether the current drilling procedures may have created a temporary gas block in the well bore, which may stop initial gas flow, per the filing.

It will continue the production test well program after the study.
