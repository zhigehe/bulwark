Landis+Gyr Group disclosed a plan to exit its electric vehicle charging business in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, according to a Tuesday release.

The Swiss smart metering and infrastructure company cited significant changes in the regulatory and market conditions, as well as the competition for its decision.

The wind-down of the business is expected to result in impairment and restructuring charges in the $35 million to $45 million range for fiscal 2024. The decision also prompted a review of the company's goodwill position in the EMEA region, which is expected to result in a non-cash one-off impairment of $100 million.
