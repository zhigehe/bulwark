Australian gold miner St Barbara said on Wednesday it was planning to separate its Atlantic Gold Operations in Nova Scotia, Canada via a sale or vend-in of its assets to another party, or a demerger into a separate Canada-listed firm.

The Atlantic Gold Operations include the miner's 15-Mile,

Beaver Dam and Cochrane Hill projects, along with its Touquoy processing plant.

After the divestment, the miner will focus on its Simberi Gold operations and the expansion of its Simberi Sulphide Project in Papua New Guinea, it said.

"The decision to separate Atlantic from St Barbara is underpinned by the... potential of the Atlantic projects under a Canadian listed company with a local leadership team... to benefit from being closer to regulators," CEO Andrew Strelein said.

Proceeds from the divestment could be distributed among shareholders or used for the Simberi Sulphide expansion, the Perth-based miner said.

The company expects to complete the divestment by the first half of fiscal 2026.
