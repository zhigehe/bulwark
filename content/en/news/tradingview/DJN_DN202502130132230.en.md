2024 was a banner year for U.S. ethanol exports, with 1.91 billion gallons shipped out of the U.S., according to data from the Renewable Fuels Association. This is expected to continue in 2025, says agricultural lender CoBank in a note, but there are risk factors that could derail the trend. The firm says buyers like Canada, Colombia, and the European Union will decide if ethanol is in for another big export year, although Trump tariff announcements could complicate things. "Shifting political sentiment abroad could result in lower ethanol inclusion rates and imports from domestic producers," says the firm, adding that changing regulations in these countries may also change their demand for ethanol.
