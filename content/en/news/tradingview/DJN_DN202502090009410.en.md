Logistics software developer WiseTech Global should be a net beneficiary of the complexity that tariffs could add to global trade, RBC analyst Garry Sherriff says. He thinks that tariffs could spur demand for the Australian company's CargoWise platform, particularly its customs and compliance modules. Sherriff tells clients in a note that medium-term structural tailwinds remain in place but anticipates near-term negative sentiment from continued leadership uncertainty and local media coverage of personal allegations against founder Richard White. RBC has a last-published sector-perform rating and A$125.00 target price on the stock, which is down 3.5% at A$125.40. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
