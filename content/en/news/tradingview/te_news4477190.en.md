China's 10-year government bond yield edged higher to around 1.64%, as investors assessed the effects of escalating global trade tensions.

The White House signaled that US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be announced as early as Thursday, building on the existing 10% levy on Chinese goods and 25% duties on steel and aluminum.

However, Trump revealed in a recent interview that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, highlighting their "very good personal relationship," which could help ease or delay ongoing tariffs.

Meanwhile, optimism grew over a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia after phone talks between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskiy.

In China, authorities are considering a 50 billion yuan aid package for China Vanke, one of the country’s largest developers, to support the struggling property sector.

While the plan has boosted investor confidence in property stocks, concerns over long-term debt sustainability remain.
