Wheat futures fell to $5.82 per bushel, retreating from a 3-1/2 month high of $5.92, amid renewed concerns over potential trade disputes, which could weaken demand for US farm products.

President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries fueled market anxiety, as traders worried about possible retaliation affecting crop sales.

While US tariffs on China did not include agricultural products, uncertainty surrounding trade policies pressured grain markets.

Additionally, traders monitored cold weather in Russia, the world’s largest wheat exporter, due to potential crop damage.

Moscow’s wheat export quota suggested that shipments could fall significantly next year, adding further uncertainty to global wheat supply.

The US Department of Agriculture is expected to provide an updated global supply and demand report soon, which could impact future price movements.
