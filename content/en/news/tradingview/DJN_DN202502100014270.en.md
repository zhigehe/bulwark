The Japanese yen may extend its uptrend against Singapore dollar, says Quek Ser Leang of UOB's Global Economics & Markets Research in a report. Last week, the JPY/SGD pair's price movements transformed into a strong rally, which broke decisively above the top of the weekly Ichimoku cloud, the markets strategist notes. The weekly moving average convergence divergence has turned positive, signaling further upside potential. The currency pair also broke clearly above the daily declining trendline resistance connecting the September and December 2024 highs, the strategist says. The nearest meaningful resistance level is the high from last December, the strategist adds. According to FactSet, JPY/SGD is 0.5% lower at 0.0089; it touched 0.0091 last December.
