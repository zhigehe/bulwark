ANZ Research upgraded its 2025 GDP growth forecast for Australia to 2.4% from 2.2% on the back of rising household consumption, which will be further supported by lower interest rates, according to a Tuesday report.

Dwelling investment is also projected to increase as building costs begin to stabilize earlier than expected. Business investment is likely to grow moderately over the near term, with firms expected to find support from low gearing levels, profit growth, and a low unemployment rate against a backdrop of rising trade uncertainties, per the report.

The unemployment rate is forecast to peak at a quarterly average of 4.2% in the second quarter before gradually falling to 3.9% at the end of 2026, ANZ Research said.

Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation is expected to re-enter the Reserve Bank's target band a little earlier. A 2.7% print is forecast for the June and December quarters. The measure is projected to ease further to 2.5% by 2026.

As such, ANZ Research expects the Reserve Bank to be "cautious" in its easing cycle, with analysts penciling in two 25-basis-point cuts in 2025.
