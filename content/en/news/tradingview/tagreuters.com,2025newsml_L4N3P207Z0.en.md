India's benchmark indexes opened lower on Tuesday after four sessions of losses, as global uncertainties and dim domestic earnings dampened sentiment.

The Nifty 50 fell 0.31% to 23,307.75 as of 9:30 a.m. IST, while the BSE Sensex shed 0.27% to 77,102.62.

Twelve of the 13 major sectors declined. The broader, more domestically-focussed smallcaps and midcaps lost 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively.

Eicher Motors lost 5% after missing third-quarter profit and margin estimates, hurt by high costs and lower sales of high-margin motorcycles. Eicher Motors dragged the auto index 1% lower.

Other Asian markets were also subdued, with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) losing 0.3% in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats.

Following up on his warnings, Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 25% "without exceptions or exemptions", escalating the risks of a trade war.

The U.S. President also said he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries in the next two days.
