The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed 1% to over 25,700 on Monday, driven by gains in commodity producers.

Key mining stocks, including Agnico Eagle, Wheaton Precious, Barrick Gold, and Franco-Nevada, rose between 1.7% and 3.3%, supported by higher bullion prices as safe-haven demand grew following President Trump’s announcement of new global steel and aluminum tariffs and plans for reciprocal tariffs by midweek, escalating trade war fears.

Energy producers Canadian Natural, Suncor, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus also outperformed, rising between 1.4% and 2.2% amid higher oil prices.

Meanwhile, Shopify jumped over 4% ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report due tomorrow.
