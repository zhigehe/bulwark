Thomson Reuters said Monday it has introduced a $150 million corporate venture capital fund, its second following a $100 million fund launched in 2021.

The company said the fund will continue to be called Thomson Reuters Ventures and will invest in early-stage technology companies in areas such as legal tech, tax and accounting, fintech, compliance, and media.

The new fund will primarily target series A investments but will also consider opportunities at earlier or later stages, the company said.

Shares were edging 0.6% higher in recent Monday premarket activity.
