Conditions for completion of the Private Placement

The completion of the Private Placement by delivery of Offer Shares toinvestorsis subject to (i) all corporate resolutions required to implement the PrivatePlacement being validly made, including the EGM resolving to issue the OfferShares and the Underwriting Shares or authorising the Company's board ofdirectors (the "Board") to do so, (ii) the SUWA remaining in full force andeffect, (iii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining in full force and effect,and (iv) the agreements for the Totalbetong Acquisitions remaining in fullforceand effect (jointly, the "Conditions"). The applicants acknowledge that thePrivate Placement will be cancelled if the Conditions are not fulfilled, andthat the completion of the Totalbetong Acquisitions is not a Condition forcompletion of the Private Placement.

Shareholders representing in aggregate ~60.5% of the shares and votes inEndúr,have undertaken to vote in favour of the resolutions at the EGM, including theissuance of the Offer Shares and the Underwriting Shares.

Potential subsequent offering and equal treatment considerations

The Private Placement represents a deviation from the shareholders'preferentialrights to subscribe for the Offer Shares. The Private Placement has beenconsidered by the Board in light of the equal treatment obligations under theNorwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, the Norwegian SecuritiesTrading Act, and the rules and guidelines on equal treatment under Oslo RuleBook II for companies listed on Euronext Oslo Børs. The Board is of theopinionthat the Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements andguidelines. The issuance of the Offer Shares is carried out as a privateplacement to inter alia partly fund the cash settlement of the considerationforthe Totalbetong Acquisitions. By structuring the equity raise as a privateplacement (with a potential Subsequent Offering, as defined below), theCompanyis able to efficiently raise capital for the abovementioned purpose at amarket-based offer price within the timeline for the Totalbetong Acquisitions.The Board notes that the Offer Price represents a 4.6% premium to the 30tradingdays volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares on EuronextOslo Børs to and including 7 February 2025, and a 1.4% discount to theCompany'sclosing share price on 7 February 2025 (the last trading day prior to theannouncement of the Totalbetong Acquisitions and the contemplated PrivatePlacement). In addition, the Company received pre-commitments and theunderwriting commitment from Kverva reducing transaction risk. On the basis ofthe above, and taking into account the potential Subsequent Offering (seebelow), the Board is of the opinion that the waiver of the preferential rightsinherent in the Private Placement is in the common interest of the Company andits shareholders.

To mitigate the dilution of existing shareholders, the Board intends to carryout a subsequent offering of up to 555,555 new shares in the Company (equal toNOK ~40 million) at the Offer Price (the "Subsequent Offering"). Any suchSubsequent Offering, if applicable and subject to applicable securities laws,will be directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of 10February2025 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter), who (i) were notincluded in the wall-crossing phase of the Private Placement, (ii) were notallocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement, and (iii) are not resident inajurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or would (in jurisdictionsother than Norway) require any prospectus, filing, registration or similaraction.

The Subsequent Offering is subject to (i) completion of the Private Placement(including approval by the EGM), (ii) necessary corporate approvals includingthe Board resolving to issue shares in the Subsequent Offering based on anauthorisation to be granted by the EGM, (iii) approval and publication of aprospectus, and (iv) the prevailing market price of the Company's sharestogether with the corresponding trading volume following the PrivatePlacement.The Board may decide that the Subsequent Offering shall not be carried out ifthe Company's shares trade at or below the subscription price in theSubsequentOffering (i.e. the Offer Price) at sufficient volumes.
