SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today announced that it has named National Seating & Mobility (“NSM”), a leading provider of complex rehabilitation technology (“CRT”), mobility and accessibility solutions, as the Company’s exclusive Ekso Indego® Personal device distributor within the CRT industry in the United States.

Ekso Indego Personal is a wearable lower extremity powered exoskeleton that enables certain individuals living with spinal cord injuries (“SCIs”) with the ability to stand and walk independently. It is the only known portable exoskeleton device to offer a modular quick connect design, which was engineered to allow users to put on and take off the device without assistance. Ekso Indego Personal is the lightest known commercial exoskeleton available offering ease of handling, transportation, and storage. Also offering an advanced gait mode, individuals with a SCI using the device have been shown to reach faster walking speeds, granting them a new level of independence in the community.

“We are excited to expand the distribution of the Ekso Indego Personal device through this strategic commercial partnership with NSM,” commented Scott Davis, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “Both companies see a world where people have widespread access to innovative technologies that allow them to rethink their current physical limitation. We are looking forward to working with NSM to make that a reality. And as a fast-growing, well-established company in the CRT space, NSM’s proven expertise and robust infrastructure are well aligned with our growth strategy.”

“NSM is committed to investing in resources and partnerships that enable us to bring the most advanced mobility and accessibility solutions to those we serve,” said Crispin Teufel, CEO of NSM. “We are proud to partner with Ekso Bionics to expand access to the life-changing Ekso Indego device to those who rely on CRT equipment and can benefit from the mobility and therapy this innovative technology provides.”

“We will apply both our expertise in providing one-of-a-kind mobility technologies for individuals with various conditions, and our experience with insurance submissions through our vast panel of insurance partners, to help bring Ekso Indego Personal to more people who could benefit from standing and walking in addition to wheeled mobility,” added Mr. Teufel.
