Micro-X raised AU$3.3 million through a placement and an institutional entitlement offer and launched a retail offer targeting a further AU$2.7 million, according to a Monday filing with the Australian bourse.

The AU$3.3 million raised capital is on top of the strategic placement of AU$2.4 million to Billion Prima at AU$0.09 per share, bringing the total secured capital from the Malaysian developer and manufacturer to AU$5.7 million.

Meanwhile, the retail component of the 1-for-10 pro-rata accelerated entitlement offer will open on Feb. 13 at a price of AU$0.07 per new share, which is more than 10% lower than the closing price on Jan. 30.

Proceeds will fund the company's medical imaging push, as well as its mobile X-ray and CT products.

The health technology company's shares were down nearly 9% in recent trade.
