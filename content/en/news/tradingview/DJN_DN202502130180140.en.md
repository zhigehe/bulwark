Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index is flat at 1592.55. External headwinds may weigh on the local bourse with foreign funds returning to net selling, Apex Securities says in a note. While bargain hunting may emerge, a lack of fresh domestic catalysts could limit gains, the brokerage reckons. Investors are awaiting Malaysia's 4Q 2024 GDP data later in the day, it says. Gold-related stocks may benefit from rising prices, while the tech sector could track Nasdaq's positive momentum, it adds. Among the gainers, Press Metal Aluminium adds 1.2% and Sunway Bhd. is up 1.1%. Meanwhile, Mr. D.I.Y. Group is down 0.6% and CelcomDigi is 1.0% lower. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
