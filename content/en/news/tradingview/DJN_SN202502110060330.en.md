Bond yields rose on Tuesday as investors awaited key testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

What's happening

* The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was 4.29%, up 0.2 basis points. Yields move in the opposite direction to prices.
* The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 4.53%, up 2.8 basis points.
* The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was 4.74%, up 2.1 basis points.

What's driving markets

Powell will be testifying for the first of two days on Capitol Hill, as other Fed officials deliver speeches.

President Donald Trump late Tuesday signed executive orders imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as Canada and the European Union vowed retaliation. The tariffs won't be implemented for a month, allowing time for negotiations.

There's also an auction of $58 billion in 3-year notes, as the consumer price index gets released on Wednesday.
