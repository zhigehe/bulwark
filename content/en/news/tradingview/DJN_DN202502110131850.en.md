South Korea's benchmark Kospi edges 0.1% lower to 2537.43 after earlier swinging between mild gains and losses, as investors assess various developments. There have been U.S. President Trump's tariff actions and U.S. trading partners' dismay and pledges of retaliation to the latest tariffs, Phillip Securities Research team says in a commentary. Also, Fed Chair Powell reiterated that the central bank was in no hurry to adjust monetary policy, leaving a cloudy outlook for further rate cuts, the team adds. Among the worst performers on the Kospi, Krafton slides 11%, and Hyundai Autoever slips 3.7%. Meanwhile, Hanwha Systems climbs 14% and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries gains 11%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
