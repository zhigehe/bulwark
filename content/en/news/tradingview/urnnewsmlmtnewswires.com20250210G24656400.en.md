Gaztransport & Technigaz , d/b/a GTT, flagged potential redundancies and suspended the construction of a gigafactory in Vendôme, France, amid a strategic review for its Elogen subsidiary.

The technology and engineering company said in a Monday release that the initial conclusions from the strategic review announced in January 2025 indicate a need to reposition Elogen's long-term focus on research and development after it did not receive any significant green hydrogen orders in 2024. Elogen logged an EBITDA of negative 33 million euros for 2024, the company added.

A reorganization and workforce adjustment project for the subsidiary will be launched to potentially eliminate 110 positions. GTT will also consider future options for the Vendôme site after suspending the gigafactory project.
