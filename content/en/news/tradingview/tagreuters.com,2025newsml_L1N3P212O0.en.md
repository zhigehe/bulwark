Spot basis bids for corn were steady to higher in the U.S. Midwest on Tuesday as futures fell and the U.S. Department of Agriculture left U.S. ending stocks unchanged for corn and beans in its monthly supply and demand report.

\* Basis bids for corn were up at a processor and river terminal in Iowa and at an ethanol plant in Illinois.

\* Basis bids for soybeans fell at an elevator in Ohio, but rose at a river terminal in Iowa.

\* Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean futures fell on Tuesday after the USDA left its U.S. corn and soybean ending stocks unchanged from January, going against trade expectations that the agency would cut ending stocks for both.

\* U.S. President Donald Trump ordered sweeping 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum into the U.S., sparking fears of retaliatory tariffs against U.S. agricultural exports.

\* CBOT March corn (CH25) futures were down 4 cents to $4.87-1/2 per bushel near mid-day. CBOT March soybeans (SH25) fell 4-1/4 cent at $10.45-1/4 a bushel.
