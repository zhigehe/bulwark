**(11:18 GMT)** \*Fiber Penetration Is Lagging in Germany, ING Says  
**(11:19 GMT)** \*Only 49% of Households Had Access to Fiber in Germany by End of 2024, ING Says  
**(11:19 GMT)** Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom to Expand Offering in Germany, ING Says — Market Talk

Fiber penetration is lagging in Germany, with only 49% of households having access by the end of 2024, ING analyst Jan Slijkerman says. "Vodafone's cable TV offering did benefit from a favorable position in the market for multidwelling units. However, Vodafone has lost its favorable position in the TV market due to a regulatory change and has lost many TV subscribers," he says. German law now prevents landlords from bundling TV services with rental agreements. The Dutch bank expects Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom to expand and upgrade their broadband networks and retain customers through offering favorable bundled products, including attractive media packages. Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom shares are up 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. (najat.kantouar@wsj.com)
