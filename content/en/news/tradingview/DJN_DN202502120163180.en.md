Quarterly Results

Choice Properties reported a net income of $791.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a net loss of $445.7 million in the same prior year period. The increase of $1,237.6 million compared to the prior year period was primarily due to changes in certain non-cash adjustments to fair value including:

* a $1,207.1 million favourable change in the adjustment to fair value of the Trust's Exchangeable Units due to the decrease in the Trust's unit price; and
* a $58.3 million favourable change in the adjustment to fair value of investment properties; partially offset by
* a $62.8 million unfavourable change in the adjustment to fair value of the investment in real estate securities of Allied, driven by the decrease in Allied's unit price in the quarter.

Annual Results

Choice Properties reported a net income of $784.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a net income of $796.7 million in the prior year. The decrease of $12.3 million compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in certain non-cash adjustments to fair value including:

* a $83.1 million unfavourable change in the adjustment to fair value of the Trust's Exchangeable Units due to the change in the Trust's unit price; and
* a $21.4 million unfavourable change in the adjustment to fair value of investment properties; partially offset by
* a $28.2 million favourable change in the adjustment to fair value of the investment in real estate securities of Allied, driven by change in Allied's unit price year over year.

The changes described above were partially offset by a $36.4 million increase in net operating income and a reversal of a $38.6 million transaction related provision during the second quarter of 2024 that was determined to be no longer required.

Quarterly Results

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, Same-Asset NOI, Cash Basis(2) increased by $6.7 million, compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased revenue from higher rental rates on renewals, new leasing, contractual rent steps, and higher recoveries in the industrial and retail portfolios.

FFO(2) increased by $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net operating income, lower general and administrative expense due to lower salaries, benefits and employee costs, and higher lease surrender revenue. The increase was partially offset by lower investment income as a result of Allied's special distribution in the prior year period, income from the sale of residential inventory in the prior year period, higher interest expense, and lower interest income.

Annual Results

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Same-Asset NOI, Cash Basis(2) increased by $29.4 million, compared to the prior year primarily due to increased revenue from higher rental rates on renewals, new leasing, contractual rent steps, and higher recoveries in the industrial and retail portfolios.

FFO(2) increased by $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense net of higher interest income, lower investment income as a result of Allied's special distribution in the prior year, higher general and administrative expense, lower lease surrender revenue, and lower income from the sale of residential inventory.

2025 Outlook

We are focused on capital preservation, delivering stable and growing cash flows and net asset value appreciation. Our high-quality portfolio is primarily leased to necessity-based tenants and logistics providers, who are less sensitive to economic volatility and therefore provide stability to our overall portfolio. We will continue to advance our development program, with a focus on commercial developments, which provides us with the best opportunity to add high-quality real estate to our portfolio at a reasonable cost and drive net asset value appreciation over time.

We are confident that our business model, stable tenant base, strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to financial management will continue to benefit us. In 2025, Choice Properties is targeting:

* Stable occupancy across the portfolio, resulting in approximately 2%-3% year-over-year growth in Same-Asset NOI, Cash Basis;
* Annual FFO per unit diluted in a range of $1.05 to $1.06, reflecting approximately 2%-3% year-over-year growth; and
* Strong leverage metrics, targeting Adjusted Debt to EBITDAFV below 7.5x.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Additional Financial Information

In addition to using performance measures determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP"), Choice Properties also measures its performance using certain non-GAAP measures, and provides these measures in this news release so that investors may do the same. Such measures and related per-unit amounts are not defined by IFRS and therefore should not be construed as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS. Furthermore, the supplemental measures used by management may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate investment trusts or enterprises. The non-GAAP measures included in this news release are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure below. Choice Properties believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring the financial performance and financial condition of the Trust for the reasons outlined below.

                                        results that reflect a property's   
                                        operations before consideration of how   
                                        it is financed or the costs of   
                                        operating the entity in which it is   
                                        held. Management believes NOI, Cash   
                                        Basis is a useful measure in   
                                        understanding period-over-period   
                                        changes in income from operations due

Funds from Operations ("FFO")           Calculated in accordance with the Real   
                                        Property Association of Canada's   
                                        ("REALpac") Funds From Operations   
                                        (FFO) & Adjusted Funds From Operations

                                        2022. Management considers FFO to be a   
                                        useful measure of operating   
                                        performance as it adjusts for items   
                                        included in net income (or loss) that   
                                        do not arise from operating activities   
                                        or do not necessarily provide an   
                                        accurate depiction of the Trust's past   
                                        or recurring performance, such as   
                                        adjustments to fair value of   
                                        Exchangeable Units, investment   
                                        properties, investment in real estate   
                                        securities, and unit-based   
                                        compensation. From time to time, the   
                                        Trust may enter into transactions that   
                                        materially impact the calculation and   
                                        are eliminated from the calculation   
                                        for management's review purposes.   
                                        Management uses and believes that FFO   
                                        is a useful measure of the Trust's   
                                        performance that, when compared period   
                                        over period, reflects the impact on   
                                        operations of trends in occupancy   
                                        levels, rental rates, operating costs   
                                        and realty taxes, acquisition

Adjusted Funds from Operations          Calculated in accordance with   
("AFFO")                                REALpac's Funds From Operations (FFO)   
                                        & Adjusted Funds From Operations   
                                        (AFFO) for IFRS issued in January   
                                        2022. Management considers AFFO to be   
                                        a useful measure of operating   
                                        performance as it further adjusts FFO   
                                        for capital expenditures that sustain   
                                        income producing properties and   
                                        eliminates the impact of straight-line   
                                        rent. AFFO is impacted by the   
                                        seasonality inherent in the timing of   
                                        executing property capital projects.   
                                        In calculating AFFO, FFO is adjusted   
                                        by excluding straight-line rent, as   
                                        well as costs incurred relating to   
                                        internal leasing activities and   
                                        property capital projects. Working   
                                        capital changes, viewed as short-term   
                                        cash requirements or surpluses are   
                                        deemed financing activities pursuant   
                                        to the methodology and are not   
                                        considered when calculating AFFO.   
                                        Capital expenditures which are   
                                        excluded and not deducted in the   
                                        calculation of AFFO comprise those   
                                        which generate a new investment   
                                        stream, such as constructing a new   
                                        retail pad during property expansion   
                                        or intensification, development   
                                        activities or acquisition activities.   
                                        Accordingly, AFFO differs from FFO in   
                                        that AFFO excludes from its definition   
                                        certain non-cash revenues and expenses   
                                        recognized under GAAP, such as   
                                        straight-line rent, but also includes   
                                        capital and leasing costs incurred   
                                        during the period which are   
                                        capitalized for GAAP purposes. From   
                                        time to time, the Trust may enter into   
                                        transactions that materially impact   
                                        the calculation and are eliminated   
                                        from the calculation for management's   
                                        review purposes.

AFFO Payout Ratio                       AFFO payout ratio is a supplementary   
                                        measure used by Management to assess   
                                        the sustainability of the Trust's   
                                        distribution payments. The ratio is   
                                        calculated using cash distributions   
                                        declared divided by AFFO.

                                        Management believes EBITDAFV is useful   
                                        in assessing the Trust's ability to   
                                        service its debt, finance capital   
                                        expenditures and provide distributions

                                        measured on a proportionate share   
                                        basis(2) , and does not include the   
                                        Exchangeable Units which are included   
                                        as part of unit equity on account of   
                                        the Exchangeable Units being   
                                        economically equivalent and receiving

                                        such as debt placement costs and

Net Asset Value ("NAV")                 NAV is an alternative measurement of   
                                        equity. It is calculated by summing   
                                        Unitholder's Equity and the fair value   
                                        of the Trust's Exchangeable Units.   
                                        Under IFRS Exchangeable Units are   
                                        considered debt. The Exchangeable   
                                        Units are not required to be repaid   
                                        and the holder of these units has the   
                                        right to convert them into Units,   
                                        therefore Management considers the   
                                        Exchangeable Units to be equivalent to   
                                        equity. NAV is a useful measure as it   
                                        reflects Management's view of the   
                                        intrinsic value of the Trust. NAV per   
                                        unit allows Management to determine if   
                                        the Trust is trading at a discount or   
                                        premium to its intrinsic value.   
--------------------------------------  --------------------------------------   
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAFV, and          Calculated as Total Adjusted Debt   
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAFV, net of       divided by EBITDAFV. This ratio is   
cash                                    used to assess the financial leverage   
                                        of Choice Properties, measure its   
                                        ability to meet financial obligations,   
                                        and provide a snapshot of its balance   
                                        sheet strength. Management also   
                                        presents this ratio with Total   
                                        Adjusted Debt calculated net of cash   
                                        and cash equivalents at the   
                                        measurement date.
