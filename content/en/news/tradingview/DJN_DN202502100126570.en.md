Chinese automakers' small exposure to the U.S. and Mexico mean they should face limited direct impact from proposed U.S. tariffs on China and Mexico, S&P Global Ratings analysts say in a report. However, what may be more meaningful are the indirect effects. If the U.S. follows through on raising tariffs on Chinese imports to as high as 60%, the Chinese economy would be hit hard, hurting automakers and suppliers, S&P says. "The unpredictability of U.S. tariff actions also weakens Chinese firms' ability to plan investments," the rating firm says. The potential 25% tariff on Mexico may drive Chinese carmakers to reconsider plans to build plants there, S&P adds, noting that the "tariff issue is much more about their ability to expand overseas, and not about returns on existing assets."
