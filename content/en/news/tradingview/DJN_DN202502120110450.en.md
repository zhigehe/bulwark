The Food and Drug Administration expanded its approval of one of Pfizer's drugs, Adcetris, allowing it to be used as a treatment for certain types of lymphoma.

The drug can be used in combination with other medicines in order to treat relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, following two prior lines of therapy, the pharmaceutical company said Wednesday.

"Each year, more than 3,500 patients in the U.S. with this aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma experience treatment failure or relapse after two prior lines of therapy," Chief Oncology Officer Roger Dansey said.

The approval is based on efficacy and safety data from a study that showed the treatment regimen reduced the risk of death by 37%. The company called the reduction a "statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival" compared with placebo.

More than 55,000 patients have been treated with Adcetris in the U.S. since it was first approved in the country in 2011. Over 140,000 patients have been treated with the treatment globally, according to Pfizer.
