\*\* Shares in Sinch jump more than 15% after the Swedish cloud services provider reported a better than expected adjusted core profit for Q4

\*\* J.P.Morgan says the Q4 adjusted EBITDA of SEK 1.00 billion exceeded consensus by 6.8%

\*\* Sinch booked a SEK 700 million one-time non-income based tax provision, which led to a Q4 net loss and may result in a cash outflow, JPM notes

\*\* This one-off is excluded from the adjusted figure

\*\* "Sinch believes it can offset this tax impact going forward by passing on the impact to clients," the broker adds

\*\* If the gains hold, the shares will see their best day since September 2024
