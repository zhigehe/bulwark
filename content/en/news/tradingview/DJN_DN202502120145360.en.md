Live cattle futures on the CME continue to back off of their recent record-high close, with the most-active contract closing down 0.2% to $1.961 a pound. Cattle has finished lower for much of February. While that in part can be attributed to the tariff uproar that's shocked commodities across the board, for cattle the downturn is more of a seasonal norm, says Dennis Smith of Archer Financial. "I suspect live cattle will struggle for another couple of weeks, or until the springtime beef demand begins to surface," Smith says. "February is a slow demand time of year for beef, by March demand starts improving." Lean hog futures closed trading up 1.5% to 94.325 cents a pound. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
