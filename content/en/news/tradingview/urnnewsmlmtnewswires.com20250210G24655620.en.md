Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group said a new indication for the inebilizumab injection to treat immunoglobulin G4-related disease has been included in the Priority Review and Approval Procedure by the National Medical Products Administration of China.

The pharmaceutical company had entered into an agreement with Viela Bio to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the drug in China's mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao, a Monday Hong Kong bourse filing said.

Viela Bio has since been acquired by Horizon Therapeutics, which was bought by Amgen in 2023.
