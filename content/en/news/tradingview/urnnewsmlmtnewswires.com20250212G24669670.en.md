Renault is reportedly working with Geely on the potential sale of the Chinese automaker's vehicles in Brazil this year through its local retail network.

Reuters reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter, that plans also include Geely's acquisition of a minority stake in Renault Brazil and using the European carmaker's plant in Curitiba. The new partnership is expected to be disclosed later in February, the sources added.

Renault and Geely did not immediately respond to requests for comment from MT Newswires.
