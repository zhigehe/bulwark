Smoltek Nanotech's (SMOL.ST) Smoltek Hydrogen entered a strategic collaboration deal with Heraeus Precious Metals for cost-effective green hydrogen production.

The Swedish nanotechnology company said Tuesday it will supply its nanostructure technology, while the German precious metals company will provide its advanced catalyst formulations for the project, which hopes to reduce the amount of iridium needed in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers.
