~Revised FY2024 revenue guidance is $26.3M instead of previous guidance of $24M

~Company expects to provide Q1 ‘25 guidance in the next two weeks~

MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — ConnectM Technology Solutions, Inc. ("ConnectM" or the "Company"), a technology company focused on the electrification economy, today announced a significant upward revision to its previously announced Q4 2024 preliminary revenue guidance of $7 million. The Company now anticipates Q4 2024 revenue of approximately $9 million, a 102% increase compared to $4.5 million revenue in Q4 2023.

The revised Q4 ’24 guidance elevates ConnectM’s full-year 2024 revenue projection to $26.3 million, reflecting 33% year-over-year growth compared to full-year 2023. This performance underscores the Company’s accelerating momentum in delivering innovative technology solutions and capturing market share across its core verticals.

ConnectM attributes this exceptional growth to increased demand for its proprietary technology platforms, expanded customer acquisitions, and operational efficiencies. The Company’s ability to exceed previous forecasts highlights the success of its strategic focus on customer-centric solutions.
