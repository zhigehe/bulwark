Shares in John Wood Group plummeted 30% in early trading on Friday after the British engineering firm said its free cash flow would be negative this year, instead of positive as previously expected.

Wood said its free cash flow could be as much as negative $200 million, compared with its previous forecast of "significant" free cash flow this year.

The company is hoping that proceeds from some disposals will help support its balance sheet and maintain debt, and that it expects to return to positive free cash flow next year.

The FTSE-250 (.FTMC) company also said it was taking steps to "significantly strengthen" its financial culture and controls after an independent review, launched last November, provisionally found material weaknesses.

"The company does not expect that the findings of the review will have a material impact on the Group's cash position or its ability to generate cash in the future," it said in a trading update.

The stock was last down 29.4% as of 0856 GMT.
