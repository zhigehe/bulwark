Fred Thiel, the CEO of Marathon Digital, a Bitcoin mining giant, is extremely bullish on Bitcoin and predicts it can reach $200K in 2025. BTC is currently trading around the $97,000 mark, which means it can double from current prices as per Fred.

The CEO credits a pro-crypto regulatory environment post the appointment of Trump as a major driving force behind Bitcoin.

As debanking gradually ends, an increasing number of banks will be able to serve crypto startups. This would encourage more businesses to put BTC on their balance sheets.

As demand increases, so does the price. Now, unlike gold and silver, you can’t just extract BTC out of thin air. The supply is only limited to 21M coins. If businesses start holding Bitcoin, the prices are bound to increase. Furthermore, there are talks of various US states leaning towards building a Bitcoin reserve. If the idea does go through, another 1% of the supply would be needed, which will push the prices more.

‘So I think there is still a big belief that Bitcoin will continue to go up in price. There’s still a lot of demand for the asset by not just retail but also institutional investors.’ – Fred Thiel.

**Donald Trump Thirsty for a Tariff War**

While Bitcoin is nicely set up for an upward move in the long run, the journey won’t be smooth, thanks to the upcoming tariff war kindled by Donald Trump.

After the tariffs imposed on Mexico and China last week, Trump said more tariffs will be imposed next week, where ‘everyone’ will be impacted.

Although Trump didn’t specify which sectors will be targeted, the automobile industry definitely seems to be one.

Trump isn’t a big fan of VAT imposed by the EU on American exports. A tit-for-tat move is expected. Steel, oil, and pharmaceuticals are some other industries that may be on the President’s radar. $BTC fell to around $91,000 during the last tariff announcement, and we may see another fall come next week.

Short-term $BTC traders might see some volatility in the coming few weeks. However, the long-term view still stays positive as several analysts have predicted an upward move for Bitcoin towards the $200K mark.

When the tariffs are in full swing, investors should look to bank on yet-to-be-listed coins that aren’t impacted by market volatility, i.e., crypto presales.

If you’re on the lookout for the next crypto to explode, there’s hardly any better than **Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)**.

**What Is $WEPE?**

**Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)** is a meme coin inspired by the famous frog meme (the same as $PEPE and $PEPU), looking to take forward the frog legacy but with a focus on small investors.

$WEPE aims to put the power of crypto trading in the hands of retail participants instead of a select few whales.

For a long time now, the crypto markets have been dictated by whales with exclusive access to classified information and news. However, Wall Street Pepe will change all that. All **$WEPE** token holders will get access to exclusive alpha calls and market information, which was earlier reserved for whales.

This community of token holders, known as the $WEPE army, can access meme coin strategies and market updates, which will help them stay a step ahead of the institutional players.

$WEPE’s community initiative has started well, too. It has amassed 45K followers on X and an active Telegram group.

**Last Chance to Buy $WEPE**

$WEPE’s idea has resonated well with the crypto community. The presale has been a massive hit, raising more than $70M.

Seeing as it’s still going strong, Wall Street Pepe is now the biggest new meme coin presale after $PEPU, which raised $73M. $PEPU, which was also driven by the frog meme, made a massive 800% return for its investors. If $WEPE manages to achieve even half of that, it will go way past the 100x mark, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now.

The $WEPE presale is in its last stretch. Although 7 days still remain, the tokens are much more likely to be sold out before that.

Available at a current price of $0.0003665, this is easily the lowest you’ll ever see **Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)** at.

Buying $WEPE is pretty simple, too. Just head over to the **official $WEPE presale website** and link your crypto wallet (like Best Wallet).

Then, ensure you have enough ETH, BNB, or USDT to purchase the number of tokens you want. Also, keep some extra ETH for gas fees. Next, punch in the number of tokens you want to buy and approve the transaction from your wallet.

**Final Words**

It’s important to remember that with a tariff war looming large, the markets are expected to be pretty volatile.

Therefore, you must do your own research before investing your hard-earned money in crypto. Also, this article isn’t financial advice.
