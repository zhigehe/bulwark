With the market being so uncertain, investors tend to shift towards these defensive names to protect their capital. Defensive stocks provide stability during market downturns, making them a crucial addition to any portfolio before a potential crash. These stocks belong to sectors that generate steady revenue regardless of economic conditions, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

Amid this backdrop, investors could consider buying three solid defensive stocks, Walmart Inc. , UnitedHealth Group Incorporated , and Johnson & Johnson , which are well-positioned to capitalize on the uncertain market conditions.

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the real GDP grew at a 2.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was from 3.1% in the third quarter but nonetheless represented an encouraging end to a year.

Yet, there’s a lot going around the U.S. economy at the moment. The news of the Trump administration’s plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners was not taken kindly by the stock market. There is also some indication that inflation might again be on a spike.

Companies in food, beverages, and household products, along with pharmaceutical companies, health insurers, and the utility service sector, see consistent demand, even in recessions. Companies in these sectors tend to experience less severe losses during market corrections, offering a cushion against volatility. Therefore, for investors, focusing on defensive stocks can provide downside protection while maintaining portfolio stability.

Considering these conducive trends, let’s examine the above-mentioned stocks in detail.
