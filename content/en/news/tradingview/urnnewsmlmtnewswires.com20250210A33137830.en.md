S&P 500 companies' latest quarterly earnings and revenue growth rates have so far surpassed expectations, with the bottom-line results up by a double-digit percentage from a year earlier, Oppenheimer Asset Management said Monday.

Some 62% of companies in the benchmark equity index had reported results through Friday, with earnings jumping nearly 13% year over year on 5.4% revenue growth. Before the reporting season's start, Bloomberg put analysts' projected bottom-line growth at 7.3%, according to Oppenheimer.

Among sectors, consumer discretionary earnings are up roughly 37%, the best performer, followed by a 28% gain at communication services. The health care, financials, and technology sectors also logged double-digit percentage gains. The energy and materials sectors have posted double-digit percentage earnings declines, while industrials' results are off 6.4%, according to the report.

For revenue, financials and health care have seen 11% growth each. Quarterly sales in the utilities sector are down 11% from a year earlier, with energy, industrials, and materials also seeing decreases, Oppenheimer said.

Data released last week showed that the US economy added fewer jobs than projected in January, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly moved down. Two surveys by the Institute for Supply Management pointed to expansions in the US manufacturing and services sectors.

"Ultimately all that matters to the markets is revenue and earnings growth and a level of sustainable economic growth at a pace that does not reach untoward levels of inflation nor raises unemployment to a level that induces economic recession," Oppenheimer Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus said in a Monday note to clients.

"From our perspective, on the radar screen, enough good things are happening to offset the negatives and the 'what if?' worry that never goes away," Stoltzfus said.

Some 78 companies are expected to report results this week, including Moderna , Palo Alto Networks , Applied Materials , Cisco , and Coca-Cola .

"We continue to favor equities for potential total return with fixed income as a complimentary asset class for current income and portfolio diversification," Stoltzfus wrote.
