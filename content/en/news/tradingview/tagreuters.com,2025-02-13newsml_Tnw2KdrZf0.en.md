(TheNewswire)




Vancouver, British Columbia, February13, 2025 – TheNewswire -Arizona Gold & Silver Inc. (OTCQB: AZASF) is pleasedto report continuous gold mineralization atpotentially bulk mineable grades from core drilling on thePhiladelphia Project in northwestern Arizona.

Two drill holes, PC24-141 and PC24-142, were completedapproximately 100 metres (“m”) north of previous drill holePC24-140 and two new holes GB-1 and GB-2.  PC24-140 was previouslyreported.  Both new holes intersected wide intercepts asfollows:

* PC24-142(starting at surface):62.18m at 1.27gpt gold and 4.06 gpt Ag
* PC24-141(starting at surface):40.39m at 1.0 gpt and 2.76 gptAg.

Both drill holes tested the Rising Fawn target,situated on patented mining claims within the main gold trend on thePhiladelphia Project.

Approximately 100m   south of these holes, a prominentoutcrop of the hanging wall high vein was channel sampled. It returnedhigh grade assays, 9.94 gptgold and 79.4 gpt silver over 1.83m.  This ledto drilling core holes GB-1 and GB-2 some 5m from the outcrop.

The new drill holes returned high grades - 2.07m at 17.45 gpt gold and 46.2 gpt silver,and 2.05m at 16.55 gpt gold and 42.7 gpt silver respectively.The next phase of drilling will focus ontargeting the down-dip extension of these high-grade intercepts.

All Drill Results (starting atsurface):

Hole ID        From(m)             To(m)          Thickness(m)   Gold gpt        Ag gpt

PC24-142        Surface              62.18               62.18                    1.27             4.06

PC24-141        Surface             40.39               40.39               1.0                2.76

GB-1                Surface               2.07                 2.07                17.65                46.2

GB-2                Surface               2.05                 2.05                16.55                42.7

The potentially bulk mineablegrades in PC24-142 and PC24-4 start at surface and compare favorablyto previously reportedPC24-140 (starting fromsurface 55.8m at 1.27gpt gold and 2.5 gpt silver).

Results from three additional holes sent to ALS labsare pending.  In addition, three holes have been submitted to SkylineLabs in Tucson and are in preparation.

Mr. Greg Hahn, VP Explorationcommented, “Our goal at Philadelphia is to developa bulktonnage gold resource forlarge scale heap leach development.  A potential grade of +0.5 gptgold would be consistent with mining operations in this district.These results indicate we are firmly on track to achieve a successfuloutcome.  Of course, a lot more drilling and engineering is ahead of us todetermine the project economics. Drilling is continuing."

Exploration Going Forward

Current drilling is testing down dip of the Rising Fawnmineralized intercepts reported herein. Drilling of the Red Hillstarget awaits assay results to guide the siting of ongoing drilling inthat area.

QA/QC Program

All assaying was conducted by ALS Global, anindependent analytical laboratory. Core was trucked to the ALS samplepreparation facility in Tucson, Arizona, where the samples areinventoried, dried, crushed and pulverized.  Pulverized splits aresent to the ALS analytical facility in Vancouver, British Columbia foranalyses. All material handling is done under a strict chain ofcustody protocol.  Gold is determined by fire assay with an AAfinish, and silver is determined by ICP-MS methods within a 31-elementsuite.

The Company maintains its own program of insertingStandard Reference material in the form of standards and blanks to thesampling stream, prior to being shipped to ALS's preparation facilityin Tucson, Arizona, in addition to the independent QA/QC protocols ofALS Global.
