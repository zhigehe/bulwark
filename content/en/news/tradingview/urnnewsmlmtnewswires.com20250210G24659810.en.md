Comvita flagged more accounting irregularities in its financial report for the fiscal year 2024, resulting in a further overstatement of net profit after tax of NZ$2 million, according to a Monday filing with the New Zealand bourse.

Combined with previously identified errors, the company's overstatement of post-tax earnings totaled NZ$1 million in the fiscal year 2023 and NZ$3 million in the fiscal year 2024, the filing said.

The independent review is now complete, per the filing.

Comvita reaffirmed its guidance, with a projected fiscal half-year loss after tax of NZ$6.5 million to NZ$7.5 million.

The health products maker's shares rose 3% in recent trade.
