The New York Fed's consumer survey's inflation-expectations gauge holds steady at a modest level. Consumers in the survey see inflation of 3% over the next one and three years, unchanged from the previous reading. That is good news as another major consumer survey, run by the University of Michigan, has showed a pronounced uptick in inflation expectations around the start of the second Trump administration. In the NY Fed survey, there was a slight increase of 0.3 percentage point in consumers' five-year inflation expectations--which also now stand at 3%. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)
