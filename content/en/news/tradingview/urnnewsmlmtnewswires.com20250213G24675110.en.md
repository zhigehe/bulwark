Unilever shares shed 7% in London late Thursday morning as it reported a year-over-year drop in 2024 profits and unveiled plans to float its ice cream business on three stock exchanges.

For the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, the UK-headquartered consumer goods giant's net profit fell 10.8% to 6.37 billion euros, weighed down by higher restructuring costs as part of its productivity program, and impairments and other one-off items, according to a Thursday release.

On the other hand, turnover rose over the period to 60.76 billion euros from 59.60 billion euros. The group also booked an 4.2% increase in underlying sales, with volumes up 2.9%, bolstered by strong performances from Dove, Vaseline and its other power brands. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets noted that the company reported a "solid set of results" for full-year 2024, consistent with company compiled consensus.

The board declared a fourth-quarter 2024 dividend of 0.4528 euro per share, up 6.1% from a year ago. The group also launched a new share buyback program of up to 1.5 billion euros, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, Unilever said its planned separation of its ice cream division remains on track to complete by 2025-end. The group intends to list the demerged business in Amsterdam, London and New York. The unit, which includes brands such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry's, will operate independently with its own management and financial structure, with Jean-Francois van Boxmeer appointed as its chair designate.

Despite a challenging environment, Unilever projects an underlying sales growth of 3% to 5% in 2025. However, it anticipates a slow start to the year amid subdued market growth in the near term and rising commodity costs.

"We are taking decisive actions in Indonesia, where long-standing challenges required a reset of the business, and China, where we are transforming our go-to-market approach during a market slowdown. We expect to see the benefits of these actions from the second half of 2025," said Chief Executive Officer Hein Schumacher.

RBC added that "The outlook emphasises a slow start to 2025, with organic sales growth for the year within the 3-5% mid-term range (company compiled consensus 4.3%) and modest EBIT margin improvement (consensus +30bps)," RBC said. "While we think the outlook is in line with consensus for 2025, we would not be surprised to see Q1/Q2 consensus coming down."
