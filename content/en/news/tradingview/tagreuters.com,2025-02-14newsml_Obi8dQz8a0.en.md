TOMRA, the global technology leader in sensor-based solutions for optimalresource productivity, announces its financial results for the fourth quarter2024.

Tove Andersen, President and CEO of TOMRA Systems ASA comments:

"I'm proud to present a record strong quarter for TOMRA - a quarter in whichintense activity ahead of Austria's deposit return system (DRS) launch havegenerated results that exceeded our expectations in Collection, and where ourRecycling division has managed to deliver a record quarter thanks to theteam'sdedication and thorough preparations. We are also pleased to see that all thehard work to turn around Food is yielding tangible results, with solidrevenuesand orders in the quarter, and profitability reaching our year-end target.

Yet the greatest news in the quarter have really been the historical progressmade by policymakers on the circular agenda. The EU's adoption of thePackagingand Packing Waste Regulation (PPWR) will shape circularity for decades,introducing the first-ever legally binding recycled content requirements forpackaging, DRS in all EU countries, and many additional promising obligationsfor the industry to boost recycling rates. With DRS regulation now in place inseveral countries including Spain and the UK, the coming years look veryencouraging for increased circularity. TOMRA is well positioned and standsreadyto support the industry in realizing these ambitions."
