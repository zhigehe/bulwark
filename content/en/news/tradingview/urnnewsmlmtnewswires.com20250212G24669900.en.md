Insurance Australia Group reported Thursday that its cash earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.26, from AU$0.17 per diluted share a year earlier.

Revenue from ordinary activities for the six months ended Dec. 31, 2024, was AU$9.04 billion, up 4% from AU$8.69 billion in the same period a year earlier.

Gross written premiums for the six months ended Dec. 31, 2024, was AU$8.43 billion, up from AU$7.95 billion in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expected gross written premiums of AU$8.6 billion.

The insurance firm expects fiscal 2025 insurance profit of AU$1.4 billion to AU$1.6 billion and gross written premiums growth of mid-to-high single digits but is expected to be towards the lower end of this range. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect net gross written premiums of AU$17.59 and EPS of AU$0.432 per diluted share.

The board declared an interim dividend of AU$0.12 per share, up from the AU$0.10 in the previous reported period, payable on March 7 to shareholders on record as of Feb. 19.
