Switzerland’s producer and import prices fell 0.3% year-on-year in January 2025, easing from a 0.9% decline in the previous month.

This marked the 21st consecutive period of falling prices but the mildest drop since the trend began in May 2023.

Producer prices were unchanged after slipping 0.1% in December, while import costs declined 0.8%, moderating from a 2.6% fall.

On a monthly basis, producer and import prices edged up 0.1% after stagnating in the prior period, driven by higher costs for petroleum products, watches, and medical and dental instruments.

Meanwhile, electricity prices declined.
