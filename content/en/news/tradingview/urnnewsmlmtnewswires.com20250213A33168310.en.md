Natural gas prices rose 4.3% early on Thursday ahead of fresh storage data as forecasts see continuing cold for most states, boosting heating demand.

Gas for March delivery was last seen up US$0.15 to US$3.72 per million British thermal units.

The rise comes as cold weather continues to boost demand, with the National Weather Service's six to 10 day outlook seeing colder than seasonal temperatures for all states east of the Rocky Mountains but Florida, with Midwest temperatures much colder than average.

The Energy Information Administration will release fresh storage data, with a smaller than average draw on stocks expected.

"For today's EIA weekly storage report, survey averages suggest a draw of -91-96 Bcf versus the 5-year average of -144 Bcf. It was warmer than normal over most of the US besides the far northern US, while wind energy generation was stronger week over week," NatGasWeather noted.
