\*\* Shares in Barclays , which rose nearly 106% last year, fall ~5% despite strong full-year results and outlook

\*\* Stock at 292.8p; among top pct losers on London's blue-chip index CURRENCYCOM:UK100

\*\* BARC expects ROTE of about 11% in 2025, slightly above analyst expectations of 10.8%

\*\* Posts PBT for the year to December 31 of 8.1 billion pounds ($10.13 billion) vs 8.07 billion pounds average of analysts' forecasts, according to a company-complied consensus

\*\* "Early price action for Barclays looks a little harsh after the group set a decent benchmark for the banking sector, closing the year with an impressive final quarter," Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says

\*\* Given the high expectations for some positive surprises leading into the numbers, some profit taking was perhaps inevitable at the opening of trade, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor

\*\* As of last close, stock up ~9% YTD

($1 = 0.7994 pounds)
