Russian consumer prices rose by 0.23% in the week to February 10, bringing price growth to 1.53% since the start of the year, compared with 1.55% in the same period of last year, data showed on Wednesday.

Russia's central bank will hold its rate-setting meeting on February 14, with analysts expecting the regulator to keep its key benchmark rate, currently at the highest level since the early 2000s, on hold at 21%.

The central bank expects inflation to slow to 4.5%-5.0% this year as a result of tight monetary policy, from 9.5% in 2024, but the weekly data shows that prices are growing at a rate above the central bank's forecast.
