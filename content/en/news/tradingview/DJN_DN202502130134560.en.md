By Chris Wack

The Public Energy Authority of Kentucky plans to sell $1.2 billion of gas-supply revenue-refunding bonds, with proceeds slated for refunding certain outstanding bonds and buying additional natural gas.

The 2025 Series A bonds are special, limited obligations of the authority, according to a document posted Wednesday on MuniOS.

The bonds will bear interest semiannually on each Feb. 1 and Aug. 1, beginning Aug. 1, 2025. The bonds mature June 1, 2055. Interest rates and yields haven't been set yet.

The bonds are backed by revenue from payments received under gas-supply contracts and certain gas projects, and will be use in part to pay for gas-supply revenue bonds, 2018 Series C.

The Public Energy Authority of Kentucky is a natural-gas-acquisition authority formed in 2008, with the purpose to develop, acquire, finance and promote secure, reliable and economic supplies of natural gas.

Moody's has assigned a municipal bond rating of Aa1 to the bonds. Morgan Stanley is the lead underwriter.
