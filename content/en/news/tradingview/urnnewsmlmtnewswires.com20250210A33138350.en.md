Springworks Therapeutics is in advanced talks on its potential acquisition by Germany-based Merck KGaA, but key conditions have yet to be met, Merck said Monday.

Merck confirmed a Reuters report about the discussions, but the company said they have not reached any legally binding agreement and there can be no certainty regarding the outcome.

A deal could be signed in the coming weeks if the talks are successful, the news agency reported earlier Monday, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.

Springworks declined to comment when contacted by MT Newswires.

Springworks shares were up more than 31% in recent trading.
