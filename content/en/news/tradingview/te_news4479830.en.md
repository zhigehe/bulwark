Chinese banks extended a record level of CNY 5130 billion in new yuan loans in January 2025, above CNY 990 billion in December and easily beating forecasts of CNY 800 billion.

The reading is also higher than the previous record CNY 4920 billion reached in January 2024.

At the beginning of the year, Chinese lenders tend to front-load loans to secure high-quality customers and expand their market share.

Meanwhile, money supply rose 7% year-on-year, below 7.3% in the previous month and forecasts of 7.2%.

Total social financing which is a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy as it includes off-balance sheet forms of financing such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales, rose to CNY 7060B billion, also a record level, compared to CNY 2860 billion in December and forecasts of CNY 6400 billion.
