Profit-taking pushed Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures lower on Friday after the market hit an October high earlier in the session, analysts said.

* Traders sought to reduce risk amid uncertainty over the potential for reciprocal U.S. tariffs to trigger retaliation that hurts demand for U.S. crops, they said.
* U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week.
* Global wheat imports are likely to drop this year as slowing economic growth among top buyers, a stronger greenback and higher local cereal output curb grain buying, putting pressure on prices.
* Canadian stocks of wheat were up at the end of December, compared to a year earlier, Statistics Canada said.
* Traders monitored cold weather that threatens to harm crops in [Russia](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia/), the world's biggest wheat importer.
* An export quota set by Moscow implied that its wheat shipments will fall sharply next year, analysts said.
* CBOT March soft red winter wheat (WH25) closed down 5 cents at $5.82-3/4 a bushel.
* K.C. March hard red winter wheat (KWH25) ended down 3-1/4 cents at $6.04-1/4 per bushel, and Minneapolis March spring wheat (MWEH25) was down 1/4 cent at $6.28-1/4 a bushel at the close of trading.
