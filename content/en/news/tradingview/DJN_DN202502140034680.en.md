Robinsons Retail Holdings' same-store sales growth is poised to accelerate in 2025, SB Equities' Lance Gabriel Soledad says in a research report. During its 4Q earnings call, the multi-format retailer stated that it's targeting SSSG of 2%-4% in 2025, compared to 2024's blended SSSG of 1.5%, the analyst notes. The Philippine company also aims for a gross profit margin increase of 20-30 basis points, along with net store additions of 130-170 this year. Moreover, the prospects of slowing inflation in the Philippines may drive a progressive rebound in the company's discretionary formats. The brokerage raises its target price to PHP57.50 from PHP50.22, partly reflecting the rollover of its earnings estimates, while maintaining an unchanged "add" rating. Shares are up 0.1% at PHP36.00.
