Maywood Acquisition (MAYA) said late Wednesday that it priced its initial public offering of 7.5 million units at $10 per unit.

The company said the units, consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one right, which grants the holder one-fifth of one Class A ordinary share upon the completion of the company's initial business combination, will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and begin trading Thursday under the 'MAYAU' ticker.

Once the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares and rights are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols 'MAYA' and 'MAYAR,' respectively, it added.

The company said it has also granted underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.1 million units to cover over-allotments.
