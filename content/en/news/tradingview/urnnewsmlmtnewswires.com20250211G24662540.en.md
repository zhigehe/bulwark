Belluscura conditionally raised gross proceeds of 675,000 pounds sterling through an oversubscribed WRAP retail offer.

The UK-based medical device developer will issue 33,750,000 shares at 0.02 pound each, with trading expected to begin on March 4, according to a Tuesday release.

The gross proceeds add to the 4 million pounds the company raised via a share placing last week, generating total net proceeds of 4.3 million pounds to buy product inventory, bolster the balance sheet and use for general working capital purposes.
