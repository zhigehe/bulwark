China is stepping in to help real estate developer China Vanke plug a funding shortfall of about 50 billion yuan in 2024, Bloomberg news reported Wednesday.

The plan includes 20 billion yuan in special bonds to buy Vanke's unsold properties, plus access to fresh loans and bond sales to cover its $4.9 billion in maturing debt, according to the report.

While investor confidence in China Vanke has improved, challenges persist, Bloomberg wrote. The company carries 982 billion yuan in liabilities, and Moody's further downgraded its rating to Caa1 from B3.

Shares of China Vanke slumped 2% in recent trade.
