Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the January CPI data fit with an overall picture that the Fed is "close but not there on inflation."

"Today's report says the same thing," he added. Last year, inflation was running at a 2.6% rate, above the Fed's 2% target, he added.

"We want to keep policy restrictive for now," Powell added. He has said the current level of the benchmark rate is restrictive, or holding down demand in order to cool inflation.
