Artius II Features a 1,000,000 Distributable Class A Ordinary Share Structure (“Tontine Structure”) with Sponsor Reducing Founder Shares by an Equal Amount

Each Unit Includes One Class A Ordinary Share, One Right to Receive 1/10th of a Class A Ordinary Share and One Contingent Right to Receive a Pro Rata Share of 1,000,000 Distributable Class A Ordinary Shares Under Tontine Structure

NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Artius II Acquisition Inc. (“Artius II” or the “Company”) announced today that it priced its initial public offering of 20,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit. The units will be listed on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) and trade under the ticker symbol “AACBU” beginning February 13, 2025. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one tenth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one contingent right to receive a pro rata share of 1,000,000 (or 1,150,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) distributable Class A ordinary shares at the closing of an initial business combination based on the number of Class A ordinary shares not redeemed prior to an initial business combination (“tontine structure”), and our sponsor will concurrently reduce founder shares by an equal amount. Once the Class A ordinary shares and rights comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and rights are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “AACB” and “AACBR,” respectively.

Santander is acting as sole book-running manager. The Company has granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.
