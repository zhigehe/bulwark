Key points:

* Eurostoxx -0.1%
* Germany DAX -0.4%
* France CAC 40 +0.1%
* UK FTSE -0.2%
* Spain IBEX -0.3%
* Italy FTSE MIB flat

This comes after the stronger gains yesterday, which helped to keep the positive momentum going for European indices since the turn of the year. We're now poised for seven straight weeks of gains, even with a bit of a breather seen on Valentine's Day. Elsewhere, US futures are marginally higher by 0.1% but it is still early in the day. We have the US retail sales data coming up later alongside more Trump headlines surely before the weekend.
