The UK’s 10-year gilt yield climbed to a two-week high of 4.556% following stronger-than-expected GDP data.

The economy grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter, defying economists' predictions of a contraction.

December’s monthly GDP reading was particularly notable, coming in at 0.4%—well above the expected 0.1% and the highest since March.

In response, markets scaled back expectations for rate cuts in 2025.

Meanwhile, in the US, traders pushed back expectations for the next Federal Reserve rate cut to December.

Persistent inflation and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious stance suggest no urgency to ease policy.
