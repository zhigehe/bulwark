Indian government bond yields are expected to trade largely unchanged in early on Friday as investors await a fresh supply of debt through the weekly auction later in the day, with the focus on further liquidity infusion announcements.

The benchmark 10-year yield (IN067934G=CC) is likely to move between 6.70% and 6.73% until the debt auction, a trader with a private bank said, compared with its previous close of 6.7103%.

New Delhi is set to raise 390 billion rupees ($4.50 billion) through a sale of bonds, including 220 billion rupees of the benchmark security.

"Looking at yesterday's cutoff for open market operation (OMO), things do not inspire much confidence for the bulls so today's cutoff, especially for the benchmark paper, would be crucial in judging investor appetite for the near term," the trader said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bought bonds worth 400 billion rupees on Thursday, with nearly 50% consisting of debt with a duration of more than 10 years.

However, the cutoff yields at which the offers were accepted were higher than market estimates, which weakened sentiment as it indicated that banks were desperate to clear their stock, traders said.

The central bank will conduct a 49-day repo for 750 billion rupees later in the day, followed by its last scheduled OMO purchase of bonds worth 200 billion rupees on February 20.

The RBI has bought bonds worth 988.35 billion rupees through auctions and secondary purchases, infused 500 billion rupees through a 56-day repo and around 440 billion rupees via a dollar/rupee swap in the last one month.

As the mega liquidity infusion package nears its end, investors will focus on the next set of infusion measures by the central bank as liquidity is set to tighten further into the financial year-end in March.
