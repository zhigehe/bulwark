An investment fund managed by Macquarie Group's European asset management arm is acquiring London-listed waste management company Renewi for 707 million pounds sterling via a scheme of arrangement, according to a joint statement on Thursday.

Under the terms of the proposed deal, Renewi shareholders will receive 8.70 pounds sterling for every share held. This is a 57% premium to Renewi's closing price on Nov. 27,Â 2024.

Renewi directors plan to back the scheme unanimously, per the statement.

The offer is being made via Earth Bidco, a new company indirectly controlled by Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 7 SCSp and BCI UK IRR Limited, a subsidiary of British Columbia Investment Management Corporation.
