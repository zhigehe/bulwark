Maurel & Prom signed a definitive agreement to acquire a 40% operating working interest in the Sinu-9 gas license in Colombia from NG Energy International.

The French oil and gas company paid a $20 million deposit of the $150 million purchase price, according to a Monday release. The remaining $130 million will be paid when the deal closes, subject to regulatory approval from the Colombian National Hydrocarbons Agency and other customary closing conditions.

The company also has the option to buy an additional 5% of Sinu-9 from NG Energy International within 12 months of the closing for $18.8 million.
