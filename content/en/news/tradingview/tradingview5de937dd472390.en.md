Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc., the parent company of Farmers and Merchants Bank, has released its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company reported a net income of $4.28 million, or $1.37 per share, a significant decrease from the $6.42 million, or $2.08 per share, reported for the same period in 2023. The decline in net income was primarily attributed to higher interest expenses due to Federal Reserve rate increases over the past several years.

**Financial Highlights**

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported:

* Net income of $4.28 million, down from $6.42 million in 2023.
* Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37, compared to $2.08 in 2023.
* Net interest income decreased by $579,928 due to a decline in the net interest margin to 2.68% from 2.97% in 2023.
* Return on average equity was 7.83%, down from 13.08% in 2023.
* Return on average assets was 0.53%, compared to 0.86% in 2023.
* Loan growth of $60 million, representing an 11.4% increase.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

During 2024, Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. saw several key business developments:

* Net interest income was impacted by higher interest expenses, driven by Federal Reserve rate changes.
* The company entered into several interest rate swaps structured as fair value hedges to offset higher interest expenses.
* Noninterest income increased by $160,947, primarily due to gains on insurance proceeds and bank-owned life insurance income.
* Noninterest expenses rose by $1.79 million, largely due to increased costs associated with a core system conversion, higher occupancy and equipment costs, and increased salaries and benefits.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Key strategic initiatives and corporate developments included:

* The completion of a core system conversion in October 2024, which is expected to provide significant efficiency gains and an enhanced customer experience.
* The repayment of $54 million in Federal Reserve Bank borrowings ahead of the maturity date.
* Maintaining a strong liquidity position with access to approximately $332 million of liquidity at year-end.

**Management's Perspective**

Gary A. Harris, President and CEO, commented, "We are pleased that our loan portfolio grew $60 million, or 11.4%, during 2024, demonstrating that our investment in additional loan production staff and facilities is paying off. Our asset quality remains high and our liquidity position remains strong. The new core system will position the bank for future growth, provide for significant efficiency gains, and an enhanced customer experience moving forward."

**Future Outlook**

The company anticipates that the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024 will improve the net interest margin in 2025. Additional rate cuts are not expected until the second half of 2025.
