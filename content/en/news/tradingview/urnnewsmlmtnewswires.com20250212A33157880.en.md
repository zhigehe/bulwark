Boeing has scaled back the number of jobs it plans to cut from the moon rocket program with NASA's Space Launch System following talks with the US space agency, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.

The company planned on eliminating around 400 positions due to changes in NASA's Artemis project and cost estimates, but has now lowered that number by half to fewer than 200 teammates, the report said, citing an email from the Boeing executive overseeing the SLS program.

The change could potentially point to greater funding certainty over the SLS project, which has faced delays, cost overruns, and technical challenges.

Boeing did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
