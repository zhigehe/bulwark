The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. edged up by one this week to 480, and was down by 19 from the same time last year, oil services company Baker Hughes reports. Rigs drilling for natural gas rose by two to 100, compared with 121 a year ago. The EIA estimates that U.S. oil production will average 13.5 million barrels a day this year versus 13.2 million b/d in 2024, with growth slowing to less than 1% in 2026. While oil companies appreciate that the Trump administration is friendly to the industry with deregulation and faster permitting, "that's only going to do so much," says Kenny Zhu of Global X. "If the market fundamentals aren't there, the prices and projections for demand are not where they need to be, I think that will ultimately be the driving factor." (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)
