Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index closed 0.2% higher at 3882.58, after fluctuating between mild gains and losses, as investors digested the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data released overnight. The reading has led to markets pricing in only one Fed rate cut this year in December, the Commerzbank Research team writes in a note. Seatrium jumped 11% after announcing that it signed a preliminary agreement with British oil major BP for a second deepwater floating production unit project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. REITs were mixed, with CapitaLand Investment and CapitaLand Ascendas REIT up 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively, while CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and Mapletree Industrial Trust each closed lower by 1.0%.
