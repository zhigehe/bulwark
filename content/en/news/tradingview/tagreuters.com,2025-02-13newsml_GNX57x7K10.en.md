BAKERSFIELD, Calif., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — ATC Managers, LLC, a direct private lender specializing in flexible real estate financing, is pleased to announce the successful closing of a $51 million loan for the acquisition and refinance of a multifamily portfolio spanning Los Angeles, Miami, Dallas, Phoenix and Atlanta.

The portfolio includes a strategic mix of properties in five cities:

Dallas: 200 units of Class C Garden-Style Apartments, valued at $18 million, priced at $90K per unit with a 7.8% cap rate. The property focuses on increasing operational efficiencies and rent growth in affordable housing areas.

Los Angeles: 100 units of Class B Workforce Housing, valued at $22 million, priced at $220K per unit with a 5.3% cap rate. Located in rapidly appreciating neighborhoods like Inglewood and North Hollywood, this property presents both stabilized and value-add opportunities.

Miami: 150 units of Value-Add Mid-Rise properties, valued at $11 million, priced at $73K per unit with a 6.0% cap rate. Situated in high-demand areas such as Little Havana and Wynwood, these properties offer strong potential for renovations and upgrades.

Phoenix: 120 units of Class B Garden-Style Apartments, valued at $8 million, priced at $67K per unit with a 6.2% cap rate. Located in areas with strong population growth and a demand for workforce housing, this property presents an opportunity for both operational improvements and rent increases.

Atlanta: 90 units of Class C Workforce Housing, valued at $6 million, priced at $66K per unit with a 7.3% cap rate. This property, located in a rapidly growing suburban area, offers significant value-add potential with renovations and rent growth opportunities.

The loan is structured with a fixed interest rate of 8.5% over a 5-year term, providing the borrower with the flexibility to execute their investment strategy, focusing on renovations, operational enhancements, and holding for long-term appreciation. This customized financing solution offers a more efficient, streamlined path to maximizing returns, without the restrictions typically associated with traditional bank financing.
