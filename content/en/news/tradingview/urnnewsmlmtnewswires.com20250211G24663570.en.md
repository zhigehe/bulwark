Easy Smart Group expects HK$2 million in profit for the six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, lower than HK$24.7 million recorded for the same period last year, a Tuesday bourse filing said.

The construction engineering company attributed the expected decrease in fiscal first-half profit to an increase in the cost of services, a decrease in profit margins from the new tender projects of the group, and certain orders remaining to be finalized.
