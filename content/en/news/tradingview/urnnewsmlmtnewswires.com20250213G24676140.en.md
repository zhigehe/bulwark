Sivers Semiconductors signed a memorandum of understanding with an undisclosed optical infrastructure company to ensure the availability of its laser array products.

The partnership includes the development of large-scale artificial intelligence workloads that will support the high-volume production of the Swedish technology company's laser arrays, according to a Thursday release.

The collaboration is part of a $4.3 million program to focus on production qualifications, high-volume manufacturing preparedness and the development of pre-production units for system testing and field trials.
