The South Korean government moved to block ministries handling sensitive information from using China's generative AI, DeepSeek, due to concerns over excessive data collection and potential information leaks to China, Pulse News reported Friday.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy issued security guidelines prohibiting inputting confidential data into the AI tool, with similar restrictions enforced by the defense and foreign affairs ministries, the report said.

Private companies are also implementing bans on DeepSeek, following security measures already adopted by countries such as the US and Japan, it said.
