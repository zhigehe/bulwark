Ascent Bridge will begin quarterly financial reporting from the fourth quarter of its 2026 financial year, covering the period from Jan. 1 to March 31, 2026, according to a Wednesday filing on the Singapore Exchange.

The move follows a disclaimer of opinion issued by Ernst & Young on the company's audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.

Under SGX rules, firms receiving such audit qualifications must transition to quarterly reporting within a one-year grace period.
