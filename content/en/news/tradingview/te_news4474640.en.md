Copper futures fell to below the $4.6 per pound on Tuesday, retreating sharply from the eight-month high of $4.7 touched on the previous session after US President Trump refrained from placing tariffs on imports of copper, as previously threatened.

The US President placed tariffs in base and ferrous metals through steel and aluminum but did not include copper orders in the executive order, increasing selling competition for domestic producers and pressuring prices.

Still, futures remained 15% higher since the start of the year amid evidence of traction in demand.

Data from the ISM showed that US manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded for the first time in over two years, raising concerns that the slump in the sector has passed.

Additionally, expectations of aggressive fiscal stimulus by the Chinese government sustained positions of higher base metal consumption this year.
