The fast fashion retailer seems set on a $50 bln listing by mid-year. With the US applying new tariffs and trade tensions heating up, the normal banker advice would be to wait. If Shein’s motivation is to gain recognition, a cut-price valuation is the wrong way to get it.

CONTEXT NEWS

Online fast fashion retailer Shein is set to cut its valuation in a potential London listing to around $50 billion, Reuters reported on February 7 citing three people with knowledge of the matter.

If the IPO were valued at $50 billion it would mark a near-quarter decline versus the company’s 2023 fundraising value.

Shein had been aiming to go public in London in the first half of 2025, assuming it secured approval from regulators in the UK as well as in China, Reuters reported in January.
