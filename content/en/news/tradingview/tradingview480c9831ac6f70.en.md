**Business and Operational Highlights**

In the fourth quarter, Curtiss-Wright experienced a 6% increase in total Aerospace & Defense (A&D) market sales and a 3% increase in total Commercial market sales. The defense markets saw solid growth, driven by increased submarine revenues in naval defense and higher OEM sales in the commercial aerospace market. The commercial markets saw growth in the power & process market, driven by higher sales of commercial nuclear products.

For the full year, new orders totaled $3.7 billion, up 20%, reflecting strong demand in the A&D markets. The backlog at the end of the year was $3.4 billion, up 20% from December 31, 2023.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

**Management's Perspective**

Lynn M. Bamford, Chair and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, commented, "Curtiss-Wright concluded the year with a strong fourth quarter financial performance that reflected better-than-expected sales growth, record quarterly adjusted diluted EPS, strong free cash flow, and robust order activity. We achieved numerous financial records in 2024 while maintaining our commitment to invest in innovative technologies, capacity expansion, talent, and systems to support our future growth."

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, Curtiss-Wright anticipates total sales growth of 7% to 8%, driven by strong organic growth in the A&D and Commercial Nuclear markets, and contributions from the recently completed acquisition of Ultra Energy. The company expects to deliver operating margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points, double-digit EPS growth, and strong free cash flow generation.
