Venus Metals started field work involving mapping, rock chip sampling, and preparation for reverse circulation and diamond drilling program scheduled for March to April at its Sandstone Gold Project in West Australia, according to a Thursday Australian bourse filing.

The drilling will take place at the Bellchambers resource area. The company said a considerable opportunity exists to define additional gold mineralization between Bellchambers and Range View, a prospect 1 kilometer away from Bellchambers.

The Range View has previously yielded high-grade drilling results, including 11 meters at 4.7 grams per tonne (g/t) grade of gold from a depth of 12 meters including 1 meter at 38.9 g/t gold from 20 meters.

Company shares were down 2% in recent Thursday trade.
