JPMorgan Chase has begun notifying employees affected by planned layoffs this year, a company spokesperson confirmed to MT Newswires Wednesday.

The spokesperson said a "very small number employees" are affected, adding that "this is part of our regular management of the business."

The news was reported earlier by Reuters. The news outlet said less than 1,000 job cuts were to be implemented this month, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The bank is also hiring in a number of areas, with about 14,000 positions still open after adding more than 7,000 jobs last year, the spokesperson told MT Newswires.
