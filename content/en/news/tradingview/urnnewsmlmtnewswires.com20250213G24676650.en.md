Tivan advanced the Sandover project in the Northern Territory, with the development of an exploration and approvals program targeting start drilling and a scoping study, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The program focuses on resource definition and project facilitation, with the company aiming to start drilling in the fourth quarter after the drill campaign at the Speewah project in Western Australia, the filing said.

The drill campaign and test work will serve as the foundation for a scoping study, scheduled for the second quarter of 2026, according to the filing.

Shares fell nearly 3% in morning trade Friday.
