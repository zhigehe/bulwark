U.S. pipeline operator Energy Transfer expects to reach a final investment decision on its Lake Charles liquefied natural gas export project by the fourth quarter of 2025, company executives said on a post-earnings call.

Energy Transfer in December said it had entered a 20-year LNG sale and purchase agreement with oil and gas major Chevron , subject to giving the project the green light.

President Donald Trump issued an order last month for the U.S. to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects, effectively reversing a pause put in place in early 2024 by former President Joe Biden.

The lifting of the export pause is expected to push companies developing LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast to move full speed ahead with their plans.
