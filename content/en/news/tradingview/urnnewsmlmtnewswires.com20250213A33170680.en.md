Trade Desk shares were down almost 33% in recent Thursday trading after analysts lowered their respective price targets following the release of the company's Q4 results.

Wedbush cut its price target by $25 to $120, BofA lowered its price target to $130 from $155, Oppenheimer reduced its target to $115 from $135 and RBC decreased it to $120 from $140.

The company reported late Wednesday Q4 revenue and Q1 revenue guidance that fell short of market expectations.
