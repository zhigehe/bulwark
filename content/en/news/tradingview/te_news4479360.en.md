India's equities fell by 311 points, or 0.4%, to 75,832, touching their nearly three-week low in early deals on Friday, after being flat in the previous session.

Almost all sectors traded in the red, led by pharmaceuticals.

Global trade uncertainty, ongoing foreign fund outflows, and disappointing Q3 earnings results continued to pressure sentiment, partly offset by easing domestic inflation.

Traders are awaiting wholesale price data for January, with the market expecting it to accelerate to a seven-month high of 2.5%.

However, a rally on Wall Street Thursday and hopes of easing the trade war following the Modi-Trump talks capped the falls.

The Nifty 50 dropped 0.5% below 23,000, with the bottom performers being Adani Ports (-2.4%), UltraTech Cement (-2.0%), and Sun Pharmaceuticals (-1.9%).

For the week, the index is heading for a 2.5% slump, the first weekly decline in three weeks, amid concerns over a potential global trade war.
