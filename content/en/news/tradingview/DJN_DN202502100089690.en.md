The estimated funding level of pension plans sponsored by S&P 1500 companies increased 1 percentage point in January to 110% as a result of an increase in equity markets and discount rates, according to consulting firm Mercer LLC. As of the end of January, the plans' estimated aggregate surplus increased by $23 billion, to $158 billion, compared with a $135 billion surplus at the end of December, Mercer said. "Markets will be closely watching for the economic impact of the recently announced tariffs and other potential executive actions," said Mercer partner Matt McDaniel. "The Fed continues to take a 'wait and see' approach with interest rates leaving plan sponsors a lot of uncertainty to process to start the new year." (jennifer.williams@wsj.com; @jenkayw)
