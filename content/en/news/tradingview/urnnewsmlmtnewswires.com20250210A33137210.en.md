UnitedHealth Group unit UMR agreed to pay at least $20.3 million to settle a lawsuit from the US Department of Labor alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

The allegations were related to UMR's processing of emergency room claims under the "True ER Policy" and urinary drug screening claims under the "UDS Protocol," according to a memorandum filed Feb. 7 by the acting secretary of labor in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.

UnitedHealth did not immediately reply to a request for comment from MT Newswires.
