Australian business conditions fell in January, while confidence improved, further closing the gap between the two measures, according to a monthly survey by National Australia Bank published Tuesday.

Business conditions fell 3 points to positive 3 index points on the back of weaker trading and profitability. Mining, retail, finance, business, property, and recreation and personal all declined, while transport and utilities, wholesale, manufacturing, and construction grew.

Business confidence improved by 6 points to positive 4 index points, only slightly below the long-run average of positive 6 index points.

"It is unclear whether this pick-up in confidence will be sustained, though the gap between conditions and confidence has been closing for some time," said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.

Elsewhere, capacity utilization fell to 82%, marking its lowest reading in three years. Purchase cost growth eased to 1.1% from 1.4% in quarterly equivalent terms, per the report.
