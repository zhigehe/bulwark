The dollar index maintained its recent rally, holding above 108.3 on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions." Trump also revealed plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs on other countries in the coming days.

This move raised concerns about a global trade war that could fuel inflation, potentially limiting the Federal Reserve's ability to cut interest rates further.

Traders were also preparing for Fed Chair Jerome Powellâ€™s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, hoping for more clarity on the future path of interest rates.

Additionally, the latest consumer inflation report is due on Wednesday, followed by producer inflation data on Thursday.

While the dollar held firm across most currencies, it struggled against the Australian dollar, which found support from stronger commodity prices.
