Key points:

* KOSPI rises, foreigners net sellers
* Korean won strengthens against dollar
* South Korea benchmark bond yield falls

Round-up of South Korean financial markets:

\*\* South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday and were set to post their best weekly gain in three months, as worries about U.S. tariffs eased.

\*\* The benchmark KOSPI was up 15.68 points, or 0.61%, at 2,598.85, as of 0303 GMT.

\*\* For the week, the KOSPI was up 3.1%, set for its biggest weekly gain since mid-November.

\*\* U.S. President Donald Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, with potential targets including South Korea, China, Japan and the European Union.

\*\* South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok said on Friday the government would thoroughly review non-tariff barriers and other vulnerabilities to respond to the plans.

\*\* "Trump said he would impose the measures after reviewing them by April 1, and the market took it positively," said Han Ji-young, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities.

\*\* "Meanwhile, we should be able to draw a picture of several countries going to the table one by one to negotiate," Han said.

\*\* Among index heavyweights, chipmaker Samsung Electronics rose 1.25% and peer SK Hynix gained 0.48%, but battery maker LG Energy Solution slid 0.56%.

\*\* Hyundai Motor shed 0.48%, but sister automaker Kia Corp gained 0.53%.

\*\* Of the total 938 traded issues, 507 shares advanced, while 372 declined.

\*\* Foreigners were net sellers of shares worth 278.9 billion won ($193.13 million).

\*\* The won was quoted at 1,444.1 per dollar on the onshore settlement platform , 0.17% higher than its previous close at 1,446.6.

\*\* The most liquid three-year Korean treasury bond yield (KR3YT=RR) fell by 0.9 basis points to 2.622%, while the benchmark 10-year yield fell by 5.2 basis points to 2.852%.
