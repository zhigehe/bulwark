Community Collaboration Delivers Essential Hygiene Products to Duluth Families in Need

**DULUTH, MN / ACCESS Newswire / February 12,Â 2025 /** Sofidel USA is proud to announce a successful partnership with two local organizations, CHUM (Churches United in Ministry) and Goodwill, to support those in need in the Duluth community. This collaborative effort has enabled the donation of essential hygiene products to local families and individuals in need.

The journey began when Sofidel's Circleville mill shipped eight pallets of Sofidel toilet tissue, hard wound towels, and kitchen towels to the Duluth Mill. Recognizing the importance of these products for residents, Sofidel reached out to CHUM, offering the donation. CHUM expressed immense gratitude for the generous gesture but quickly realized that coordinating the logistics for such a large donation would be a challenge.

In response, CHUM turned to Goodwill for assistance. Goodwill, always committed to helping those in need, stepped in to offer storage space for the products and provided transportation services from Sofidel's Circleville mill to their warehouse. Once stored, Goodwill will ensure that the products are distributed to a variety of CHUM programs, including St. Francis Apartments, the Drop-In Center, and the emergency shelter program for families and individuals.

"We are incredibly grateful to Sofidel, CHUM, and Goodwill for their collaboration in helping us provide essential hygiene products to those who need them most," said Tim Solomon, a key member of the loading team at Sofidel. "It was a true team effort, and we are honored to have played a part in supporting our local community."

This partnership highlights the power of community collaboration and the positive impact that can be made when local organizations come together to address the needs of those facing hardship. Sofidel is committed to continuing its support of local initiatives and is proud to work alongside organizations like CHUM and Goodwill to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need.
