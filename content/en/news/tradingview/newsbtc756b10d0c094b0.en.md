A newly released video analysis by crypto commentator asif.eth (@asifeth) makes the case that Dogecoin is currently trading at what he calls a heavily undervalued level. He offered an explanation of why he believes the coin’s ongoing correction may have just concluded—a process he interpreted through an Elliott Wave lens and, more specifically, an ABC corrective pattern.

**Has Dogecoin Finished Its ABC Correction?**

In his discussion, the analyst described how Dogecoin had exhibited a pronounced rise, after which he saw “the first A correction and after that we got a B higher high, higher low… and after that we got a C type correction.”

He suggested that this final “C wave” might have drawn the token back into a crucial support region, remarking that “this could be ABC and the current correction is playing out with an RSI at oversold territory,” a condition he views as a strong buy signal. Although he acknowledged the possibility of miscounting the waves, he maintained that the structure points to a broad corrective phase that could now be nearing completion.

The key price region he identified spans from around $0.24 down to $0.18, an area he repeatedly called a “very, very good” place to accumulate Dogecoin. He referred to it as a “huge supply turn to huge demand zone,” noting that the token had previously flipped this same range between support and resistance several times.

While he has confidence in the bullish significance of that zone, he outlined $0.16 as a strict cutoff below which he would exit a Dogecoin position, stating, “If in any case… you break below $0.16, you have to sell that token,” because a drop beneath that level could invalidate the entire bullish setup. His point was that continuing to hold an altcoin below such a critical support might expose traders to deeper losses if negative sentiment suddenly accelerates.

He also backed up his argument by pointing to the so-called Fib golden pocket, measured from what he described as Dogecoin’s last major low in August 2024 to the subsequent price high. By overlapping that Fibonacci retracement with the same $0.24–$0.18 demand region, he found consistent evidence that the market views this band as pivotal for Dogecoin’s long-term structure. He described it as “exactly aligning with our top supply zone,” explaining that confluence like this—in combination with an oversold RSI reading—boosts the likelihood of a price rebound.

Although the analyst mentioned that Dogecoin’s “hype” factor has waned, he interpreted that lack of mainstream speculation as a positive sign, claiming “no one is selling Dogecoin like hyper aggressively,” which could foster stability in the near term. The sentiment, in his view, might shift sharply once traders realize that the coin has bottomed in its ABC correction, especially if broader market conditions turn more favorable.

He concluded by reiterating the importance of watching these levels closely. He sees the $0.24–$0.18 corridor as a prime accumulation zone, views $0.16 as a clear stop-loss level in case the market breaks down, and believes Dogecoin’s price action around these thresholds will confirm whether the ABC correction is truly complete.

Recalling his own words, “Dogecoin is looking very, very good and very, very discounted in this whole market,” he urged potential buyers to consider the coin’s risk-to-reward ratio at a time when other traders, anticipating the end of the so-called meme coin era, appear to be overlooking it.

At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.
