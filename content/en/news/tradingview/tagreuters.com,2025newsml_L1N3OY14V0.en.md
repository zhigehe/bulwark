Basis bids for hard red winter wheat were mostly steady in the U.S. Plains on Friday as farmers waited for higher prices before selling and trading remained quiet, dealers said.

\* The basis declined at a grain co-op in Goodland, Texas.

\* Profit-taking pushed Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures lower on Friday after the market hit an October high earlier in the session, analysts said.

\* Traders are monitoring the potential for retaliation against U.S. tariffs that would hurt demand for U.S. crops, they said.

\* Global wheat imports are likely to drop this year as slowing economic growth among top buyers, a stronger greenback and higher local cereal output curb grain buying, putting pressure on prices.

\* Protein premiums for HRW wheat shipped by rail to or through Kansas City decreased by 3 cents for wheat with 13% protein content. Premiums for other grades were unchanged.

\* K.C. March hard red winter wheat (KWH25) ended down 3-1/4 cents at $6.04-1/4 per bushel.
