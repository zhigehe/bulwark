Australian shares were set to open largely unchanged on Thursday with potential gains by local miners to offset likely losses in local oil firms, while investors braced themselves for another day of key corporate earnings, and assessed the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation print.

The local share price index futures (YAPcm1) rose 0.2%, a 39.3-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.6% to a record close of 8,535.3 points on Wednesday.

New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index inched 0.2% lower in early trade.
