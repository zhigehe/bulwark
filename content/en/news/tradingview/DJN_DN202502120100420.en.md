Oil prices fall in evening trade after U.S. crude oil inventories rose for a third straight week and CPI figures showed inflation heated up last month. Brent crude is down 1.3% to $75.98 a barrel, while WTI falls 1.5% to $72.24 a barrel. Oil stocks rose by 4.1 million barrels last week, well above expectations of a 2.4-million-barrel increase, signaling weaker demand in the world's top crude consumer. Also, the latest U.S. data showed inflation picked up speed in January, extending a recent pattern of price increases that upholds the Fed's more cautious stance on interest-rate cuts. Higher rates typically boost the U.S. dollar and make commodities like oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. Meanwhile, concerns over escalating trade tensions continue to cast a shadow on global growth and the oil-demand outlook, putting pressure on prices. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)
