\*\* Shares in AF Gruppen rise nearly 3% after the contractor and industrial group reported consensus-beating Q4 results and proposed an H1 dividend

\*\* It posted Q4 EBIT increasing to NOK 607 million ($55 million) from NOK 302 million a year ago, which Kepler Cheuvreux says is 28% ahead of consensus

\*\* The company proposed a dividend of NOK 5.00 per share for H1 2025

\*\* "Overall, we view AF Gruppen's Q4 results as stronger compared with expectations," Albin Sandberg, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, says

\*\* Sandberg adds that the dividend for H1 2025 was "reassuring", and that Civil Engineering units weaker performance was more than offset by other divisions
