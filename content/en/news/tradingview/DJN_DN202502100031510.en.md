Porsche's recently issued 2025 outlook implies a significant reset of near-term expectations, with margin guidance of 10%-12% versus consensus at 14.4%, Berenberg analyst Romain Gourvil writes. Although strategic readjustments at the luxury car maker were largely anticipated, related investments seem higher than expected, he adds. "This may add pressure to near-term multiples until Porsche can demonstrate it can sustainably deliver margins of 17%-plus, which is likely now to be heavily discounted by investors." Berenberg lowers its operating profit estimates by around 20% for 2025-26, downgrades its rating to hold from buy and lowers its price target to 62 euros from 75 euros. Shares trade 1.5% higher at 56.38 euros. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
