The Wendy’s Company has released its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 29, 2024. The report highlights significant growth in systemwide sales, revenue, and adjusted earnings per share, alongside strategic updates to its capital allocation policy.

**Financial Highlights**

Wendy’s reported a 5.4% increase in systemwide sales for the fourth quarter, reaching $3.7 billion, and a 3.1% increase for the full year, totaling $14.5 billion. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $574.3 million, a 6.4% increase, while full-year revenues were $2.2 billion, up by 2.0%. Net income for the fourth quarter was $47.5 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of $137.5 million, marking an 8.6% increase. For the full year, net income was $194.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $543.6 million, a 1.4% increase. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter and full year were $0.23 and $0.95, respectively, with adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter at $0.25, a 19.0% increase, and $1.00 for the full year, a 3.1% increase.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Wendy’s achieved its 14th consecutive year of same-restaurant sales growth, with a 4.3% increase in the fourth quarter and a 1.5% increase for the full year. The company also reported a higher U.S. company-operated restaurant margin, driven by a higher average check, customer count growth, and labor efficiencies. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefits.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

The company updated its capital allocation policy, targeting a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of adjusted earnings and planning to repurchase up to $200 million of its shares in 2025. Wendy’s declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on March 17, 2025. The company repurchased 0.9 million shares for $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and an additional 0.5 million shares for $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Kirk Tanner, President and CEO, expressed pride in the company’s performance, highlighting the 14th consecutive year of global same-restaurant sales growth. Tanner emphasized the company’s strong position to accelerate growth and the strategic roadmap for Wendy’s future, aiming to maximize long-term shareholder value through the new capital allocation policy.

**Future Outlook**

For 2025, Wendy’s projects global systemwide sales growth of 2.0% to 3.0%, adjusted earnings per share between $0.98 and $1.02, adjusted EBITDA of $550 to $560 million, capital expenditures of $100 to $110 million, and free cash flow of $275 to $285 million.
