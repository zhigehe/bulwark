Japan’s 10-year government bond yield rose above 1.35% on Friday, hovering near a 15-year high, as investors took some relief from US President Donald Trump’s decision to delay reciprocal tariffs.

Meanwhile, Japan has reportedly engaged with the Trump administration, with authorities pledging to respond appropriately while assessing the levies' details and impact once announced.

On the monetary policy front, the outlook for the Bank of Japan remains hawkish.

Wholesale inflation hit a seven-month high of 4.2% in January, reinforcing rate hike expectations.

This comes after BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda warned in parliament that persistently high food prices could shape inflation expectations.

The data precede next week’s CPI report, where core inflation is expected to accelerate to a 17-month high.

In the US, hotter-than-expected PPI inflation further strengthened market speculations, with traders now pricing in just one Fed rate cut this year.
