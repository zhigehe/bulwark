Azenta, Inc., a leading provider of life sciences solutions, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter, highlighting significant financial and operational achievements. The company, which specializes in Multiomics and Sample Management Solutions, has shown notable growth and efficiency improvements, setting a positive outlook for future performance.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Revenue**: $147.5 million, increased by 4% compared to the prior year period, driven by growth in both Multiomics and Sample Management Solutions segments.

**Gross Profit**: $68.7 million, representing a gross margin of 47%, up from 44% in the prior year period, due to higher revenues and margin expansion, particularly in Sample Management Solutions.

**Operating Loss**: $(11.4) million, improved from $(16.2) million in the prior year period, reflecting operational efficiencies and a favorable sales mix.

**Net Loss**: $(13.3) million, improved from $(15.7) million in the prior year period, primarily due to decreased loss from discontinued operations.

**Basic Net Loss Per Share**: $(0.29), compared to $(0.28) in the prior year period, reflecting the impact of lower interest income and higher income tax expense.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments**

The Sample Management Solutions segment reported revenue of $81.2 million, driven by growth in Sample Repository Services and Core Products, including Automated Stores, Cryogenic Systems, and Consumables. The Multiomics segment generated $66.3 million in revenue, with increases in Next Generation Sequencing and Gene Synthesis services, partially offset by a decline in Sanger sequencing.

**Geographical Performance**

The United States remains the largest market, contributing $93.5 million in revenue. China and the United Kingdom also showed strong performance, with revenues of $14.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The rest of Europe contributed $24.3 million, while the Asia Pacific/Other regions accounted for $7.0 million.

**Operational Efficiency**

The company achieved operational efficiencies, particularly in the Sample Management Solutions segment, which contributed to margin expansion. This was driven by improved sales mix and the impact of non-recurring items from the previous year.

**Future Outlook**

The company plans to focus on driving revenue growth and profitability in its core Sample Management Solutions and Multiomics segments following the planned sale of the B Medical Systems business. This strategic move is expected to simplify the company's portfolio and enhance its focus on core operations.
