(The Insurer) - The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index has shown that cyber insurance rate decreases accelerated sequentially overall to 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, with declines continuing to be seen in every region.

The 7 percent global drop in Q4 2024 compared with the 6 percent rate decreases that Marsh had reported for each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024, which had followed a 3 percent drop in Q4 2023.

In the US, cyber rates decreased 5 percent, which compared with a 4 percent reduction in Q4.

“There was abundant capacity for both primary and excess cyber insurance programs, with additional new capacity anticipated in 2025,” Marsh said on the state of play in the US.

The broker added that insureds with strong cybersecurity practices typically used premium savings to purchase higher limits, reduce retentions, and shorten waiting periods. About 20 percent of Marsh’s US clients opted for higher limits in 2024.

In addition, claims volume increased in 2024, with over 2,000 claims in the US related to privacy breaches, supply chain issues, and ransomware. However, while average ransom demands increased, the number of companies paying ransoms declined year over year.

“Cyber risk continues to evolve; themes include the importance of strong cybersecurity controls, resilience against ransomware threats, awareness of aggregation exposure and third-party risks, the impact of generative AI, and emerging privacy regulations,” Marsh said.

UK decreases slow, European decreases accelerate

UK cyber rates decreased 6 percent in Q4 compared with 8 percent in Q3, with Marsh noting that the inflow of capacity into the market continued from both incumbent and new insurers.

“Since the second half of 2022, the cyber insurance market has seen increased competition from new and existing carriers, resulting in generally reduced rates and more extensive coverage,” the broker said of the UK.

Clients with annual revenues greater than £250mn typically experienced greater rate decreases.

European cyber rates decreased 14 percent in Q4, an acceleration from 11 percent in Q3.

“Many clients received discounts; clients with over €250mn in revenue experienced larger rate reductions compared to those with lower revenues,” Marsh said. “Clients with revenues up to €500mn experienced significantly more competition due to increased capacity.”

The broker also said that capacity per layer increased, with more insurer consortiums offering larger primary quota shares and individual insurers providing higher primary limits.

“Premium reductions typically were reinvested into higher limits or reduced retentions,” Marsh said. “Coverage restrictions were lifted in some cases due to improved underlying risk quality and insurers' increased flexibility to broaden coverage.”

In addition, underwriters were generally showing greater flexibility, focusing on key controls and offering capacity for improved risks. But they remained wary of potential catastrophic and systemic cyber losses, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape.

LatAm and Asia decreases accelerate

Latin America and Caribbean cyber rates declined 7 percent in Q4 compared with 5 percent in Q3.

“Clients typically increased limits, saw greater insurer flexibility, and were able to purchase broader coverage,” Marsh said. “Reinsurers showed a greater appetite for risks in the region, providing broader coverage than most local insurers.”

The broker also highlighted a significant increase in notifications for ransomware, extortion, and large data breaches in the second half of 2024.

“Supply chain attacks increased, particularly affecting industries reliant on interconnected ecosystems, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation,” it said.

In addition, Marsh said that stricter data privacy enforcement is emerging in Latin America, particularly in Chile and Brazil, aligning with EU General Data Protection Regulation standards.

Asia cyber rates decreased 11 percent in Q4 compared with 7 percent in Q3, with Marsh stating that increased competition from new and existing insurers continued to drive a decline in rates.

“High-severity, low-frequency ransomware claims contributed to ongoing portfolio volatility,” it added of Asia.

Pacific cyber rates decreased 8 percent in Q4 compared with 11 percent in Q3.

“Clients increasingly looked to reinvest premium savings into higher limits, supported by limit modeling analytics,” Marsh said.

It added: “Insurers enhanced their offerings and expanded risk management services, with an emphasis on LTAs and broad coverage.”

In addition, changes to privacy legislation and compliance in Australia introduced new requirements, such as mandatory ransomware payment reporting.

Canadian cyber rates decreased 3 percent in Q4, compared with 1 percent in Q3, as new capacity continued to enter the market.

“A 5 percent reduction on primary layers was typical when there were no significant changes to client exposure or the program,” Marsh said. “Many clients obtained enhanced coverage and reduced retentions without a corresponding premium increase.”

It added: “Reductions in excess layer premiums were key to overall program savings, with 3 percent to 10 percent reductions common when primary layers renewed flat.”

India, Middle East, and Africa cyber rates decreased 18 percent compared with 16 percent in Q3.

The Middle East experienced declines of over 37 percent, India remained stable, and South Africa saw increases of 15 percent to 20 percent.

“Incumbent insurers sought to retain clients and new capacity, particularly in excess and primary layers, entered the market,” Marsh said. “In the Middle East, increased capacity from new entrants and competitive pricing was evident; insurers in India and Africa have been more cautious, but a shift in approach was beginning to emerge.”
