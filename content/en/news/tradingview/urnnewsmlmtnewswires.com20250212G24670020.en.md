THK Co. set a goal to achieve over 10% return on equity ahead of its initial fiscal year 2026 target, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The plan includes restructuring its automotive and transportation business, optimizing costs in industrial machinery, and focusing on profitability and capital efficiency.

THK aims for 40 billion yen in operating income, supporting a net profit of 30 billion yen.

The firm will reduce cash holdings, tolerate higher debt, and maintain an 8% dividend on equity with flexible share buybacks. It also plans M&A-driven growth and governance reforms.
