North America represented 62.1% of the roughly $1.5 trillion held in private-debt funds at the end of 2023, Fitch Ratings says in a report, citing data from research-provider Preqin. Private-debt assets in the Asia-Pacific region expanded at an annual average of 18.8% during the 2018-2023 period, compared to 14.3% in North America and 12.1% in Europe, according to Fitch. "Dry powder (defined as capital committed but not yet called) in private debt has a similar global distribution. North America ended 2024 with $233.1 billion of private debt dry powder, while Europe had $114.5 billion," the credit-rating specialist adds, again citing Preqin's data.
