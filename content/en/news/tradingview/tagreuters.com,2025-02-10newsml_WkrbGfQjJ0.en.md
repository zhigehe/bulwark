Summa Defence Oy

Summa Defence Ltd

Press release, free for publication on 10.2.2025 at 10:30

Summa Defence Oy is establishing a joint venture with Ukrainian AI company Griselda, with Summa Defence holding the majority stake. The joint venture strengthens Summa Defence's technological capabilities in utilizing data and AI for creating real-time situational awareness.

Drones play a key role in data production. Griselda complements Summa Defence's drone system capabilities in creating situational awareness.

The collaboration aims to strengthen the defense capabilities of Europe and partner countries by developing and implementing advanced technologies that enable real-time, AI-assisted data processing at all stages, from collection and analysis to decision-making. This provides significant advantage on the battlefield, for example in Ukraine.

"Knowledge of the enemy plays a crucial role in warfare. Griselda is involved in creating this knowledge in the Ukraine war, and its unique AI tools and algorithms provide real-time situational awareness and accelerate decision-making on the battlefield. Together with Summa Defence, these tools will be made available to NATO countries and to complement Summa's ecosystem," states **Jussi Holopainen**, CEO of Summa Defence Oy.

Summa Defence brings together defense and security industry companies to create a new strong growth company in the sector. The company's acquisition strategy focuses on companies that have already proven their technologies' applicability both in defense industry and civilian markets. Companies must have the passion and capability to grow internationally, especially in NATO member countries. The owners' commitment to continue developing and growing the business is also crucial. The companies maintain their own identities while leveraging group synergies and participating in larger international projects.
