An unexpected rate hold by the Philippines central bank is likely a pause rather than a halt to rate cuts, Capital Economics says. The central bank reiterated that it is still in an easing cycle, and that the decision to stand pat was due to uncertainties regarding U.S. trade policy, says senior Asia economist Gareth Leather. U.S. trade policy will remain uncertain for a while, and BSP clearly needs time before it decides on a response, he adds. "Our assumption is that the Philippines will be hit by a 10% universal tariff, but that the impact will be relatively small." If inflation stays under control, then further rate cuts are likely over the coming months, he says. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
