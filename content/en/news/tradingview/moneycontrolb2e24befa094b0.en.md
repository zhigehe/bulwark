A fresh tariff scare by US President Donald Trump roiled Indian equities, with the benchmark indices ending lower for a fourth day on February 10, dragging Nifty 50 near 23,300. President Trump had earlier said that he would impose additional tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.

Broader indices underperformed the benchmarks, with Nifty Midcap and Smallcap lower by 2 percent each.

Trent, Power Grid Corp, Tata Steel, Titan Company, ONGC were among the top losers on the Nifty, while gainers were Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia Industries, Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies, Tata Consumer Products.
