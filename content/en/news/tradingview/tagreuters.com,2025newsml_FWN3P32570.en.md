Douglas reported on Thursday a 1.5% rise in its first quarter adjusted core profit, below expectations, as it lacked a boost from one-off effects related to the IPO and strategic projects of the previous year, the German perfume and cosmetics retailer said.

Its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 1.5% to 353.5 million euros ($368.88 million in the first three months of its fiscal year 2024/25 ending Sept. 30, below the average of 371.1 million in a Vara poll.
