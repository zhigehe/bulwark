Fox Corp said on Monday it has purchased Red Seat Ventures, the digital media company whose clients include former Fox News stars Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson, in a bid to tap younger audiences and the growing podcast market.

Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal represents an investment in a new area of media, the so-called creator economy, in which individual personalities such as Carlson, Kelly, Shawn Ryan and Candace Owens use platforms like podcasts to reach young audiences.

Red Seat Ventures will operate independently within Fox's Tubi Media Group, which operates a free video streaming service.
