Australia’s 10-year government bond yield fell slightly to 4.42% as investors assessed the latest domestic economic data.

Consumer confidence rose slightly in February but remained subdued amid concerns over household finances and the rising cost of living.

Meanwhile, business sentiment improved in January, hitting its highest level since October, despite struggles with sales and profitability.

These data came ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s interest rate decision next week, where it is widely expected to deliver its first rate cut in four years.

Traders are currently pricing in a 95% chance of a 25bps reduction, amid signs of easing underlying inflation.

On the global front, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. steel and aluminum imports, which go into effect on March 4.

However, following a telephone conversation with Australia’s Prime Minister, Trump agreed to consider exempting Australia from these measures.
