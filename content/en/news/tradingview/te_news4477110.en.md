The Japanese yen weakened past 154 per dollar, hitting its lowest level in over a week, as hotter-than-expected US consumer inflation data led traders to scale back expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Markets are now pricing in only one quarter-point Fed rate cut this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating before Congress that the central bank is not in a hurry to ease policy.

Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda provided no clear guidance on the future path of interest rates.

In a parliamentary session, when asked about the exit from Japanâ€™s large-scale stimulus program, Ueda reiterated that the BOJ would continue its current monetary policy to achieve a sustainable 2% inflation rate.

However, BOJ board member Naoki Tamura raised the possibility of a rate hike, suggesting last week that the central bank may need to raise its policy rate to at least 1% in the latter half of fiscal 2025.
