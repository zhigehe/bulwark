The Japanese yen weakened past 153 per dollar on Wednesday, reaching a one-week low after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda provided no clear guidance on the future trajectory of interest rates.

In a parliamentary session, when asked about the exit from Japan’s massive stimulus program, Ueda reiterated that the central bank would maintain its monetary policy with the goal of achieving a sustainable 2% inflation rate.

In contrast, BOJ board member Naoki Tamura suggested last week that the central bank may need to raise the policy rate to at least 1% in the latter half of fiscal 2025.

Externally, the yen faced additional pressure from US President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs, which could drive up inflation and limit the Federal Reserve's ability to further reduce interest rates.
