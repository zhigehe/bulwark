The British pound rose to $1.25 after preliminary data showed the UK economy grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024, defying expectations of a 0.1% contraction and outperforming the Bank of England’s forecasts.

The economy is now slightly larger than before Labour took office in July, offering the government some relief.

However, challenges persist, with the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility set to release an updated economic and fiscal outlook on March 26th, amid reports that it has lowered its growth projections.

Last week, the Bank of England cut interest rates by 25bps to 4.5%, its third rate cut since beginning its easing cycle in August 2024, and downgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7%.
