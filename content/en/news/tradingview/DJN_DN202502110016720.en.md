TUI's first-quarter profit growth is encouraging, but weaker EBIT at the company's markets and airline segment could cause some nervousness, Barclays analysts say in a research note. The German travel operator's markets and airlines unit posted a 38% wider EBIT loss in the first quarter. At the same time, TUI's bookings and average selling prices normalised for both the winter and summer. Barclays says it expects TUI is on track to deliver on its fiscal-year guidance, but with no change to guidance and with nearly 70% of its summer program yet to be sold, consensus estimates are unlikely to materially change. Shares trade 6.7% lower to 7.97 euros.(pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)
