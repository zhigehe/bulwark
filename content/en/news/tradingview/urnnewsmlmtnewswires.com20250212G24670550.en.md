Kajima profit attributable to owners of the parent declined 2.7% to 74.5 billion yen in the nine months ended Dec. 31, from 76.6 billion yen a year ago as higher costs more than offset slightly better revenue.

The construction firm's basic earnings per share (EPS) fell to 158.94 yen from 167.76 yen a year ago, according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing on Wednesday.

Revenue increased 1.6% to 2.026 trillion yen from 1.995 trillion a year earlier.

In a separate filing, the company said it raised its earnings forecast in light of current business performance.

It forecasted attributable profit at 120 billion yen or 254.17 yen per share (from 116 billion yen or 245.70 yen per share previously) and revenues of 2.870 trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31.

It expects to pay a year-end dividend of 59.00 yen per share, bringing the total to 90.00 per share for the fiscal year.
