Most brokerages still expect a slower pace of interest-rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2025, following tepid jobs data on Friday and ongoing uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in January after two months of strong gains, but an unemployment rate of 4% will likely allow the Fed to hold off cutting rates at least until June.

On the other hand, President Trump's tariff policy is expected to drive up inflation and increase pressure on the U.S. central bank as it looks to control persistently high prices.

The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range in its January policy meeting and Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate.

Here are the forecasts from brokerages after Friday's non-farm payrolls (NFP) data:
