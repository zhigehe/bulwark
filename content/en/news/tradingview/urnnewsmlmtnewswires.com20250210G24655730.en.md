Vitec Software Group (VIT-B.ST) secured a multicurrency revolving credit facility of 3 billion kronor and established a medium-term note program of 5 billion kronor.

The Dutch software company said the new facility from Nordea and SEB replaces its existing revolver and acquisition loan credit, according to a Monday release. It has a term of five years, including extension options.

Meanwhile, the new debt program will be used so the company can trade notes on Nasdaq Stockholm and other markets. Vitec said it will help diversify its sources of financing.

The company noted that the new revolver and debt program will allow it to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future.
