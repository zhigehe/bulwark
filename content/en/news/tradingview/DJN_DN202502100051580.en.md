The cost of insuring euro credit against default using credit default swaps edges lower as markets settle after the French budget passed through parliament last week and the Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Falls are limited, however, as tariff risks loom, with U.S. President Trump announcing plans for 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Sunday. Markets could be underestimating the threat of a trade war, asset management company, Edmond de Rothschild, says in a note. The iTraxx Europe Crossover index which tracks euro junk bond credit default swaps falls 2 basis points to 290bps, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show. The iTraxx Europe Senior Financials which tracks euro investment-grade financial bonds, declines 1bp to 59bps. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
