By Nina Kienle

Legrand's net profit and revenue for 2024 rose, beating market expectations, on strong growth in its data center business.

The French electrical and digital building infrastructure manufacturer on Thursday posted net profit for the full year of 1.17 billion euros ($1.21 billion), up from 1.15 billion euros the prior year, on sales that rose 2.8% to 8.65 billion euros.

Net profit came in above analysts' forecast of 1.12 billion euros, according to consensus estimates provided by Visible Alpha.

Revenue exceeded analysts' expected 8.54 billion euros, according to company compiled estimates, but came in-line with Legrand's expected low single digit sales growth.

Operating profit rose to 1.64 billion euros from 1.59 billion euros, with an adjusted operating margin after acquisitions of 20.5%. The figure exceeded Legrand's expected range of 20.0% to 20.4%.

The company said it would propose a dividend of 2.20 euros per share, a 5% raise compared to the prior year.

For 2025, Legrand is targeting sales growth of between 6% and 10%, and an adjusted operating margin holding stable overall compared with 2024.
