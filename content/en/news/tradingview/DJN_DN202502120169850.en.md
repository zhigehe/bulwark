Hong Leong Bank's 1H FY2025 net profit may rise by mid-to-high single digits on year, driven by strong income growth and cost discipline, though contributions from its associate, Bank of Chengdu, may soften amid China's policy rate cuts, RHB IB analysts say. Nabil Thoo and David Chong say the lender is likely to see robust income growth in 2Q FY2025, with net interest income holding steady. Loan growth may exceed 6%-7% guidance as sequentially weaker ringgit could lead to forex gains, they add. The analysts expect non-interest income for 2Q could also be strong, particularly from treasury and markets income amid a conducive trading environment. RHB maintains a buy rating on Hong Leong Bank and keeps target price at MYR26.60. Shares are 0.5% lower at MYR20.54. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
