The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it has approved SpringWorks Therapeutics' drug to treat a type of rare genetic disorder, which causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body.

The drug, branded as Gomekli, was approved for adults and children 2 years of age and older suffering from neurofibromatosis type 1, with symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas in which the tumor cannot be surgically removed.

The approval was based on a mid-stage trial, where the drug showed 20% or more reduction in tumor volume in 52% of pediatric patients and 41% of adult patients.

Shares of the company gained 2% in extended trading. SpringWorks did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment seeking details on pricing.

Earlier this week, Merck KGaA , the German healthcare and technology group, said it was in advanced talks to acquire SpringWorks.
