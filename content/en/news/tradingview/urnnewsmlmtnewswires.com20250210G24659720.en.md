Hot Chili said drilling results at its La Verde copper-gold porphyry discovery in Chile near its Costa Fuego copper hub showed mineralized intersections extending over 300 meters vertically, beginning at shallow depths, according to a Tuesday Australian bourse filing.

The results showed multiple significant drill intersections, including 320 meters at 0.3% copper and 0.1 grams per tonne grade of gold from 34 meters to end-of-hole, the filing said.

The mining firm completed 19 reverse circulation drill holes at the discovery.

It is currently planning a diamond drilling program to test for potentially deeper, higher-grade zones intersected at depth.

Hot Chili's shares jumped 9% in recent trading on Tuesday.
