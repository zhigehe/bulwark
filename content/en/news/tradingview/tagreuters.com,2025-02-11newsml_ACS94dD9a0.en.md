NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 / Scotts Miracle-Gro

***By Kenny Dieglio***

Math is everywhere, and when Doodles and Digits is involved, math is fun, too. This year, Doodles and Digits and The Scotts Miracle-Gro Foundation announced a partnership to underwrite the television debut of "How It's Math" on Public Television.

**Foundation Partner**

Director of ESG and Social Impact **Katherine Dickens** shared why this is such a great fit for our company: "When Caroline from Doodles & Digits approached us, she shared a compelling picture of the dire state of education for elementary age children post-Covid. Caroline has a local link to Scotts as someone living in Columbus with awareness of the company. She presented a need that was really meaningful."

**Continued Connection**

It turns out that not only was the Foundation a wonderful fit for Doodles and Digits, but ScottsMiracle-Gro's R&D department was a winning equation for a program segment. As we mentioned, math is everywhere, and that includes throughout a lawn and garden company. From product development to field tests, math is at the forefront of innovation at ScottsMiracle-Gro.

Caroline Farkas, founder of Doodles and Digits, loved the connection between education, math and gardening: "First and foremost, we seek organizations that are passionate about education and making a positive impact on young learners. It's important that the organization values creativity, innovation, and real-world learning," says Caroline. "We consider how the organization's work intersects with the themes we explore on our show, such as science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM)."

If you're ready to learn "How It's Math" both at ScottsMiracle-Gro and in a variety of other real world examples, check it out on PBS.
