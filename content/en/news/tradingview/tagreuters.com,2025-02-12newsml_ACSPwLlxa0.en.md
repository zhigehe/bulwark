Relocation to More Efficient Space Supports Growth While Reducing Overhead by Over $200,000 Annually

**ANN ARBOR, MI /** **ACCESS Newswire** **/ February 12, 2025 /** Zomedica Corp. (NYSE American:ZOM) ("Zomedica" or the "Company"), a veterinary health company offering point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic products for equine and companion animals, today announced that that Company has relocated its corporate headquarters to a new facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

"Our new headquarters marks an exciting milestone for Zomedica. This move not only provides us with a modernized workspace to accommodate our growing team but also allows us to operate more efficiently by significantly reducing our lease expenses," said Larry Heaton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. "Our priority is to make strategic decisions that drive the long-term success of our company. This new space is not only more functional and appealing but also significantly more cost-effective, allowing us to optimize resources while continuing to invest in innovation and growth."

Zomedica's lease for its prior Ann Arbor headquarters, located on Phoenix Drive, expired on January 31, 2025. Under the new lease, Zomedica reduced square footage by approximately 19%, and reduced base annual rent by approximately 50%, representing more than $200,000 in annual cost savings for Zomedica.

"This move is another way we are working diligently to hit profitability," said Scott Jordan, Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer of Zomedica. "By significantly lowering our lease expenses, we are freeing up capital that can be reinvested into the business, accelerating our path to financial sustainability and long-term success."
