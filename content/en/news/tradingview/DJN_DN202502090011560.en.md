Kendrick Lamar spent months trading diss tracks with rival rapper Drake. So ahead of the Super Bowl, fans wondered: Would he play his biggest hit from the feud, the Grammy-winning song "Not Like Us," on the field at halftime?

Samuel L. Jackson introduced Lamar dressed as Uncle Sam in front of a giant Tic-Tac-Toe board. The rapper opened his set with "GNX" and "Squabble Up," perched on a Buick GNX as dancers dressed in red, white and blue hopped out.

"The revolution about to be televised," Lamar said.
