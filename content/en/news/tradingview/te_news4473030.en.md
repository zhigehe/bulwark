The CAC 40 edged higher to trade around 7,984 on Monday, rebounding from a 0.4% loss in the previous session as investors looked to shake off concerns over escalating trade tensions.

President Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, with additional tariffs expected to be unveiled on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz emphasized that the EU is prepared to respond "within an hour" if the US imposes tariffs on European goods.

On the corporate side, Edenred led the index with a 1.4% gain, followed by Schneider Electric, with shares rising 1.2%, and Cap Gemini and Vivendi, both up by 1% each.

Conversely, ArcelorMittal was the biggest laggard, with shares dropping 2.1% after Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs.
