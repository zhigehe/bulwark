Shares of technology companies rose as a protectionist vow boosted Intel's shares.

Intel surged by more than 6% after Vice President J.D. Vance vowed that artificial-intelligence chips would be made in the U.S. About 90% of the world's most advanced chips — including the main processors inside mobile phones, AI graphics processing units, and personal computers — are made in Taiwan by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, though the company is building a small Arizona plant. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor initially slipped before recovering late in the session.

Shopify's profit doubled in the fourth quarter after revenue rose by nearly a third, boosted by strong sales during the holidays and deeper integration with more online merchants. Separately, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China's largest chip maker, reported lower profit during the traditional off-peak season but said it expects continued revenue growth in the current quarter.

Tesla shares tumbled by more than 6% as traders digested reports that Chief Executive Elon Musk was diving into yet another daring venture, offering to buy out artificial-intelligence firm OpenAI. With Musk's attention already divided between the electric-car maker, rocket company SpaceX and government duties, investors are wary that Tesla oversight will grow lax.
