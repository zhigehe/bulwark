Shares of energy companies rose as one prominent Wall Street firm increased its exposure to the sector.

Activist Elliott Investment Management disclosed a stake in Phillips 66 valued at more than $2.5 billion and said it's pushing the oil refiner to consider operational changes to boost its stagnant stock. Elliott has become more active in the energy sector of late, recently divulging a stake in British oil major BP. In response to pressure from Elliott, BP said it would reset its strategy with a new direction.

Oil futures rose amid anxiety about a potential trade war, and tensions between Israel and Hamas over their cease-fire and hostage-release agreement. Israel said hostilities would recommence on Saturday if hostages were not released. Hamas had vowed to postpone the releases due to delays on humanitarian aid.
