NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / February 10, 2025 / It's official - 2024 was the hottest year on record. With global temperatures at 1.28 degrees Celsius above NASA's 20th-century baseline (1951-1980) - topping the recording set in 2023 - the need to invest in resource conversation is more critical than ever.

As a leading science and technology company, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is continuing its accelerated emissions reduction. The company's Group-wide and Life Science Sustainability Strategy highlights this goal and is making significant progress toward achieving a 50% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2020.

The EDISON program serves as one of the four key levers to achieve this goal by providing funding to sites across the globe to implement high-impact energy and water reduction projects. After a record year of progress in 2023, the program delivered another exceptional year in 2024, completing **42** projects globally. As a result, the Life Science business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which operates as MilliporeSigma in the United States and Canada, is projected to avoid more than **24,000** MWh (megawatt hours) of energy use, conserve over **124,000** cubic meters of water, and prevent nearly **4,000** tons of CO2 emissions through an investment of €9.3 million.

**2024 EDISON highlights:**

Cooling Tower Conservation in Carlsbad, California, USA

A dual softener system was installed at the cooling towers in the company's Carlsbad, California, USA facility to provide a continuous source of water for the cooling towers. This €40,000 investment reduces water demand for both the makeup to the cooling towers and the discharge or blowdown to sanitary sewer.

"The Carlsbad Viral Vector Manufacturing site successfully completed an EDISON project to enhance water conservation in its condenser water system," said Michael Naughton, Head of EHS Carlsbad. "By using a water softener to increase cooling tower cycles from 3 to 10, the site reduced system blowdown from an average of 9,000 gallons per day in October 2023 to just 90 gallons per day in October 2024-achieving a 96% water retention rate. This milestone underscores our commitment to water sustainability and advancing corporate sustainability goals."

Lab Variable Air Volume (VAV) System in Miamisburg, Ohio, USA

One of the standout EDISON projects in 2024 focused on optimizing energy efficiency in Miamisburg, Ohio, USA with seven chemical production labs, four constant-volume air handlers, and 41 fume hoods. Through a €488,000 investment, this lab Variable Air Volume (VAV) control system interfaces all seven lab spaces, ensuring safe airflow while adjusting air handlers during low-demand periods to create a variable air volume system.

"The project included installing new airflow sensors, automatic sash closures, and variable frequency drive (VFD) controls to create a variable air volume system," said John Shay, Manager, Engineering & Maintenance. "With these upgrades, the facility is expected to save 808 MWh of electricity and 35,000 Therms of natural gas annually."

**Heat Pump Installation in Irvine, United Kingdom**

A heat pump was installed at the company's Irvine, United Kingdom site to help reduce the site's natural gas usage. In alignment with the company's decarbonization strategy, the €460,000 investment is expected to save 1,900 MWh of energy each year by transitioning to electric heat sources.

"The Irvine site received EDISON funding in 2024 to install a heat pump, allowing two low-temperature hot water boilers to be used only as backups," said Anthony McLaren, Senior Process Engineer. "This project is expected to reduce Natural Gas consumption by 1,900 MWh annually, avoiding 360 tons of CO₂ emissions, as the site's electricity comes from 100% renewable sources. This initiative is a key step in reducing our carbon footprint as we work toward Net Zero."

**Driving Progress into 2025**

For 2025, EDISON has put forth its largest investment yet, totaling €11.7 million to fund another 50 projects. This will cover **30 different locations globally**. Projections indicate that these projects will avoid an additional 5,300 tons of CO2 emissions, deliver more than 30,500 MWh of energy savings, and save 37,000 cubic meters of water.
