There could be some tactical trading opportunity before China's "two sessions" meeting in March as DeepSeek and Lunar New Year's consumption data boosted sentiment, Daiwa analysts write in a note. Onshore investors have been celebrating DeepSeek's rise as another China tech breakthrough in circumventing the U.S. tech restrictions, they say. Such "national pride" could make the Chinese stock market less vulnerable to U.S.-China confrontation and help sustain the sentiment recovery longer, Daiwa says. Meanwhile, Chinese consumption has seen some improvement during the Lunar New Year break, the analysts add. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
