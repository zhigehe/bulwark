The dollar falls to a two-month low against a basket of currencies after President Trump announced plans for reciprocal tariffs to be assessed on a country-by-country basis as opposed to blanket tariffs. Such a process should "inevitably take some time" with investigations expected to complete by April 1 and remedies implemented immediately after, Deutsche Bank analysts say in a note. "In the meantime, questions whether this tariff threat will be used as a negotiating tool are likely to linger." The limited tariff news and lower yields after Thursday's U.S. producer prices data dented the dollar, they say. The DXY dollar index falls to a low of 106.962. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
