99 Speed Mart Retail could continue expanding its market share by displacing independent mini-market players in Malaysia, say Citi analysts in a note. The mini-market chain's footprint is at 12% and it is likely to open distribution centers along the east of Malaysia, they write. "Based on [99 Speed Mart Retail's] plan to increase its store count by 250 outlets annually, it would take the company up to end-2027 before cannibalization begins," the analysts say. Citi initiates coverage of the stock with a buy/high risk rating and a target price of MYR2.90. Shares are 0.4% lower at MYR2.25. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
