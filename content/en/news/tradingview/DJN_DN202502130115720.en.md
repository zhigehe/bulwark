The euro's current strength might not last as optimism for a deal to end the Ukraine war looks overdone, Monex Europe analysts say in a note. The prospect of Russian gas supplies resuming seems unlikely as that would leave the rest of Europe hostage to further Russian aggression, they say. The potential gain from Russia as an export market is also probably overstated. Furthermore, a deal could prove detrimental to Europe's security in the longer term. "We continue to see downside risks to the euro in the short to medium term, despite the initial bias to take the single currency higher." The euro rises 0.5% to an 8-day high of $1.0442, FactSet data show. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)
