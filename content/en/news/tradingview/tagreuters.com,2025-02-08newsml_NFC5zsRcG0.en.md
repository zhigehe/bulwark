New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - February 8, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. ("Integral Ad Science" or the "Company") and reminds investors of the **March 31, 2025 deadline** to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that IAS was experiencing a new material trend of increased competitive pricing pressures and that, as a result, IAS had been forced to cut prices to compensate for weakening demand and slowing revenue growth; (2) that IAS's pricing function was no longer "favorable" and IAS could not sustain its pricing and drive price increases; (3) that pricing had become a key differentiator between IAS and its competitor necessary to close major renewals and new deals; and (4) as a result, the IAS's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On February 27, 2024, after the market closed, IAS reported fourth quarter results for 2023 and announced lackluster revenue guidance below analysts' estimates. On an earnings call that same day, the Company admitted that these disappointing revenue numbers resulted from pricing cuts issued to customers across the Company's measurement and optimization businesses. Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Lisa Utzschneider ("Utzschneider") stated, "[w]e are seeing more competitive pricing in measurement on a select group of large contract renewals in exchange for increased volume commitments and multi-year exclusive agreements."

In response to this news, on February 28, 2024, the Company's stock price declined $7.09 (or approximately 41%) to $10.01 per share from the previous day's close of $17.10 per share

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Integral Ad Science's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.
