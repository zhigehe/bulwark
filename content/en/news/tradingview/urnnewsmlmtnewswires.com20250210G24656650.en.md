Royal Philips is collaborating with the World Bank and Ukraine's health ministry to establish an advanced nationwide acute stroke treatment network in the Eastern European country.

Under the joint initiative, the Dutch health technology company is delivering advanced image-guided therapy systems optimized for acute stroke treatment to key regions across the nation. It will deploy 25 of its Azurion interventional suites and provide clinical training for the network, according to a Monday release.

Philips is working with its partner AFS Medizintechnik to roll out the systems, with 19 already installed.
