**LONDON, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —** VivoPower International PLC ("VivoPower" or the "Company") announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tembo e-LV B.V. (“Tembo”), has entered into a definitive supply agreement with the pre-eminent safari operator and fellow Certified B Corporation, Asilia Africa (“Asilia”), to deploy Tembo’s ruggedized electric utility vehicles across Asilia’s safari operations in East Africa, marking a transformative step toward decarbonizing the tourism sector in Africa.

Under the first phase of the agreement, Tembo will supply its next generation EUV25 EPower conversion kits, with the first delivery scheduled from the end of February 2025. Assembly will be completed locally in Kenya.

Established in 2004, Asilia Africa has become a renowned leader in immersive safari experiences across East Africa. It is committed to delivering exceptional safaris while safeguarding the region’s ecosystems and wildlife. Asilia owns 16 bespoke camps and lodges across Kenya and Tanzania, employing nearly 1,000 people. It operates 165 Landcruisers as part of its vehicle fleet. Asilia is a member of the Nawiri Group, a B Corp Certified organization dedicated to sustainable, community-driven impact in East Africa.

The definitive supply agreement between VivoPower and Asilia underscores a shared commitment to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and innovation—core tenets of the B Corporation certification held by both companies.

The partnership aligns with VivoPower’s mission to deliver sustainable energy and transportation solutions that enhance operational resilience and cost savings while reducing carbon footprints. It also builds upon Asilia’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 while preserving the pristine ecosystems central to its business. Tembo’s purpose-built electric utility vehicles (EUVs) will replace diesel-powered fleets in Asilia’s remote safari camps, eliminating emissions, noise pollution, and operational reliance on fossil fuels in ecologically sensitive regions.

Matthew Nestor, VivoPower’s Global Head of Partnerships and Sales, said: “We are delighted to have been selected by Asilia as their fleet electrification partner. This partnership exemplifies how aligned values drive meaningful progress in sustainability. Asilia’s leadership in eco-conscious tourism and Tembo’s ruggedized EV technology combined, can prove that electrification will be effective even in the most challenging environments—protecting wildlife, supporting local communities, and offering guests a cleaner, quieter safari experience.”

Gerard Beaton, Head of Operations, Asilia Africa, said:

“Asilia Africa is committed to pioneering sustainable tourism solutions that protect and preserve the incredible ecosystems we call home. We are very pleased to be partnering with a fellow B Corporation in VivoPower and Tembo as we accelerate our plans of reducing our environmental footprint while enhancing the safari experience for our guests. By integrating Tembo’s electric utility vehicles into our fleet, we can not only lower our carbon emissions but also contribute to the long-term sustainability of Africa’s wilderness. This collaboration reflects our dedication to responsible tourism, innovation, and community-driven impact, ensuring that future generations can continue to experience the magic of East Africa’s landscapes and wildlife.”
