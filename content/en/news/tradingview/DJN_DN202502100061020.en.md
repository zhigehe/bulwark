Grain futures on the CBOT are mixed pre-market, with tomorrow's WASDE report spurring positioning among traders. Friday's CFTC Commitments of Traders report showed mostly cuts to short positions among fund traders--thereby increasing the size of net long positions in grains. This is most evident in corn, with the net long through February 4 being now over 364,000 contracts. Profit-taking may be on tap today ahead of the WASDE says Tomm Pfitzenmaier of Summit Commodity Brokerage in a note, "although few in the trade are expecting a bearish surprise," he says. Most-active corn is unchanged pre-market, while soybeans are down 0.2% and wheat is up 0.2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
