Santos said that the first production from its Halyard-2 infill well, part of its Western Australia gas project, has started six weeks ahead of schedule, according to a Thursday filing with the Australian bourse.

The well is now producing 65 million standard cubic feet per day of gas, which will be supplied to the Varanus Island gas facility, the filing said.

The project is expected to convert about 9 million barrels of oil equivalent of sales gas and condensate into proven and probable reserves, supporting lower production costs through 2025, the filing added.
