LINCOLN, NE / ACCESS Newswire / February 13,Â 2025 / The Arbor Day Foundation launched a new campaign aimed at transforming individual environmental commitments into collective impact. Through the initiative, people can pledge specific eco-friendly actions to improve the planet - big or small - and the Foundation will plant a tree in a forest in need to mark each commitment.

"Hope for our planet is bold. It's time we put that hope in motion. This campaign is an opportunity for people around the world to come together in the name of a healthier future for our world," said Dan Lambe, chief executive of the Arbor Day Foundation. "We all have a role to play in this effort, because together, small acts can add up to global good."

Here's how it works: Once participants log their commitment at arborday.org/planet-pledge, the Foundation will plant a tree in a recovering forest in their honor and provide participants tips on how to help the habit stick.

When considering an eco-friendly habit to adopt, there is no commitment too small. Here are 10 easy ways to make a Planet Pledge.

**1. Carry a reusable water bottle or coffee cup.** Opting for reusable containers over single use plastic can help reduce waste and pollution.

2. Bike, use public transportation, or carpool regularly. Choosing to bike instead of drive, even just once a day, can reduce an individual's carbon emission by 67%. On average, carpooling or using public transit can reduce an individual's carbon footprint by half.

**3. Wash clothes in cold water.** About 90% of the energy used by a washing machine goes toward heating the water. Switching to a cold-water wash could significantly lower energy use and help save homeowners money.

4. Mend clothing instead of discarding or donating. Repairing worn out clothing can help keep garments out of landfills, where 92 million tons of clothing waste ends up.

**5. Bring reusable bags shopping.** Using reusable bags can help cut down on litter both on land and in the ocean.

**6. Take shorter showers to conserve water.** Limiting your time in the shower can reduce your personal water use by about 45 gallons a week.

**7. Volunteer at a community garden.** Community gardens can help increase local access to fresh food and create urban green spaces that support local diversity.

8. Set up recurring donations to environmental causes. Just a few dollars can make a big impact in communities and ecosystems in need of support.

**9. Compost food scraps and/or yard waste.** Composting food scraps can reduce food waste, enrich the soil, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

**10. Plant a tree.** Trees play a critical role in creating healthier and more connected communities. They can clean the air, mitigate extreme heat, and reduce the impact of flooding.
