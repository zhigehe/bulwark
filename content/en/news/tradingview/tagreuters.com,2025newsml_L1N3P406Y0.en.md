Nestle posted a slightly better-than-expected annual sales growth on Thursday, as the world's biggest packaged food company raised prices for its coffees, chocolates and pet food.

Nestle maintained its organic sales outlook for 2025 and forecast stronger annual growth from its 2024 levels.

Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency movements and acquisitions, rose 2.2% in the full year ended December 31, the maker of Maggi stock cubes and Nescafe coffee said.

Analysts, on average, expected organic sales growth of 2.1%.

Sales decreased by 1.8% to 91.35 billion francs ($100.27 billion).

($1 = 0.9110 Swiss francs)
