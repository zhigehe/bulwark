VERU INC., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines for the management of cancer and other serious diseases, has released its Form 10-Q report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and key business developments during the period.

**Financial Highlights**

**Net Revenues:** VERU INC. reported net revenues of $4.5 million, a significant increase from $2.1 million in the prior year period. This growth was primarily driven by sales of the FC2 Female Condom, which are now classified under discontinued operations.

**Gross Profit:** The company's gross profit improved to $1.6 million, up from $1.2 million in the prior year period, indicating enhanced profitability from discontinued operations.

**Operating Loss from Continuing Operations:** VERU INC. recorded an operating loss from continuing operations of $(10.2) million, an increase from $(7.4) million in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher research and development expenses.

**Net Loss:** The net loss for the period was $(8.9) million, compared to $(8.3) million in the prior year period. The increase in net loss was largely attributable to losses from discontinued operations.

**Net Loss from Continuing Operations Per Basic and Diluted Common Shares Outstanding:** The net loss from continuing operations per basic and diluted common share was $(0.01), compared to $(0.08) in the prior year period. This reflects a decrease in loss per share due to a higher number of shares outstanding.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments:** During the three months ended December 31,Â 2024, and 2023, most of VERU INC.'s net revenues were derived from sales of the FC2 Female Condom, which are now classified within discontinued operations following the sale of the FC2 business.

**New Product Launches:** The company is developing enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor modulator, for use in sarcopenic obese or overweight older patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists. The Phase 2b QUALITY clinical trial for enobosarm has shown positive topline results, indicating its potential to preserve lean mass and improve body composition.

**New Production Initiatives:** VERU INC. is working on a novel, patentable, modified release formulation for enobosarm, which is expected to be available for a Phase 1 bioavailability clinical trial during the first half of 2025. This formulation is anticipated to be used in Phase 3 obesity clinical studies and for commercialization.

**Future Outlook:** Following the positive results from the Phase 2b QUALITY clinical trial, the company plans to move forward with an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for enobosarm. The proposed Phase 3 clinical trial will focus on older patients who are obese or overweight and eligible for GLP-1 RA treatment, with a primary objective of assessing the effect of enobosarm on physical function.

**Atherosclerosis Inflammation Program:** VERU INC. is developing sabizabulin, an oral microtubule disruptor, as a broad anti-inflammatory agent to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This program is based on the understanding that inflammation plays a significant role in the progression of coronary artery disease.
