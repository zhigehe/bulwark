Capita said its contract to provide marine engineering training to the U.K. Royal Navy has been expanded, bringing its total value to 1.3 billion pounds ($1.61 billion).

The outsourcing and professional services company said Tuesday that the expansion would allow it to provide a range of services including training design and media, training delivery, training support, quality assurance, and equipment management, at HMS Sultan and Survival School, from May 1.

The additional scope is valued at 97 million pounds ($120 million), London-listed Capita added.

The contract had originally been awarded to Capita in 2021.
