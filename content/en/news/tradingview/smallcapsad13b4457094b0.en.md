Lithium Universe has entered into a strategic partnership with La Corporation de l’École Polytechnique de Montréal (Polytechnique Montréal) aimed at advancing lithium processing technologies and strengthening the local supply chain for critical battery materials in Canada. The partnership will offer numerous educational opportunities to local students including internships, fellowships, co-ops and joint academic projects, with a view to supporting diversity, encouraging entrepreneurship and incubating start-ups within the sector. It will also facilitate student placements and co-developed research projects, enhancing the educational landscape and promoting practical experience in the lithium industry. Sustainable practices Lithium Universe chair Iggy Tan said the partnership would aim to drive sustainable practices within the industry while supporting the commercialisation of new technologies. “It is a privilege for us to partner with this prestigious university as we ignite innovation and cultivate a thriving lithium battery industry in Canada,” he said. “Together, we are committed to educational excellence and sustainable industry growth, shaping a future where Canadian expertise leads the global stage.” Leading school Polytechnique Montréal is one of Canada’s leading engineering schools, known for its research and innovation in applied sciences and technology. The school is affiliated with the Université de Montréal and serves as a hub for multidisciplinary research and development. Polytechnique’s commitment to addressing global challenges, including sustainability and energy transition, aligns with Lithium Universe’s mission to support the advancement of critical materials for clean energy. ‘Innovative partnership’ Polytechnique director Augustin Brais welcomed the opportunity to work with Lithium Universe. “We are enthusiastic about this new, synergetic and innovative partnership that will enhance our educational and research mission towards a greener and more sustainable societal electrical energy future,” he said. The initial five-year collaboration will seek to develop and strengthen Canada’s capabilities in lithium processing tailored for the battery industry and conduct research to innovate lithium technologies. Aluminosilicate deal Lithium Universe secured a deal earlier this week with sustainable building firm Lafarge Canada for the exclusive supply of an aluminosilicate secondary product from its Bécancour lithium refinery. Aluminosilicate can improve cement strength and durability by absorbing the calcium hydroxide produced during hydration, filling gaps and reducing heat generation. It also helps resist cracking in large-volume concrete by mitigating temperature-induced stress. The company expects the non-binding memorandum of understanding with Lafarge to enhance North America’s battery materials supply chain and promote sustainable innovation in Canada’s cement industry.
