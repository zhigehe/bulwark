The People’s Bank of China would adjust its monetary policy at the appropriate time to support the economy, amid rising external headwinds.

The plan came amid external changes and domestic challenges such as insufficient domestic demand and potential risks.

The central bank, in its fourth-quarter monetary policy implementation report, said that it would make comprehensive use of its monetary policy toolkit, including interest rates and the bank reserve requirement ratio, and adjust the intensity and pace of policy measures based on domestic and international economic and financial conditions, as Reuters reported.

The PBOC added that it would keep liquidity ample, promote a reasonable rebound in prices, and stabilize the yuan exchange rate at a reasonable level.
