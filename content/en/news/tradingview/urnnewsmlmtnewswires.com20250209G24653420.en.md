WiseTech Global near-term sentiment remained negative, amid further allegations of misconduct against founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Richard White, and the absence of a permanent CEO, according to a Monday report by The Australian, citing RBC capital markets.

Additionally, WiseTech's fiscal first-half earnings outlook remains "skewed to the downside," following a revenue guidance downgrade, the report said.

In November, the company cut its full-year revenue guidance between AU$1.2 billion to AU$1.3 billion from its previous guidance of AU$1.3 billion to AU$1.35 billion, citing delays to its customer transport optimization.

Despite ongoing challenges, RBC analyst Garry Sherriff sees medium-term growth for WiseTech, driven by increased demand for its CargoWise platform due to tariff-related customs and compliance needs.

"Medium-term structural tailwinds remain solid," Sherriff said.

RBC maintained a neutral rating for WiseTech Global and a price target of AU$125.

Shares of the company fell 7% in recent Monday trade.
