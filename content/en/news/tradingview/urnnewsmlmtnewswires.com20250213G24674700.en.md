The growth of agricultural product prices helped accelerate producer prices in Japan to a level higher than forecasted by analysts.

The producer price index or PPI grew 4.2% on a year-on-year basis, the Bank of Japan said in a Thursday release.

The current figures, which rose to its fastest in 19 months, were higher than the market estimate of 4%, Bloomberg News reported on the same day.

As per month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.3%.

The growth can be attributed to agricultural products, which jumped 36.2% from the prior year, the highest among other commodities, the BOJ said. The products include meat products, such as beef, chicken, pork, as well as forestry and fishery products.

The increase in product prices may strengthen views that the central bank could introduce higher and faster interest rate hikes, Bloomberg said. In a survey conducted by the media outlet, 45% of respondents believed that the next rate hike would be announced in July.
