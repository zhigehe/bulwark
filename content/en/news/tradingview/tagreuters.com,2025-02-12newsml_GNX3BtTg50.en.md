CORSICANA, Texas, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Birchtech Corp. (OTCQB: BCHT) ("Birchtech" or the "Company"), a leader in specialty activated carbon technologies for sustainable air and water treatment, today announced the engagement of international investor relations specialists MZ Group (MZ) to lead a strategic investor relations and financial communications program across all key markets.

MZ Group will work closely with Birchtech management to develop and implement a comprehensive capital markets strategy designed to increase the Company’s visibility throughout the investment community. The initiative will highlight how Birchtech is supporting a cleaner future for customers and their communities through its two operating divisions, ME₂C Environmental and WE₂C Environmental. ME₂C Environmental maintains a solid revenue stream and expects to build significant additional revenue momentum with its pioneering and patented mercury emissions reduction SEA® Sorbent Technology, monetizing widespread adoption through a successful IP enforcement strategy. WE₂C Environmental is focused on revolutionizing water purification with advanced activated carbon solutions with a specialization on PFAS ("forever chemicals") removal, ensuring compliance with new EPA regulations.

MZ has developed a distinguished reputation as a premier resource for institutional investors, brokers, analysts, and private investors. Lucas A. Zimmerman, Managing Director at MZ North America, and Ian Scargill, Senior Vice President, will advise Birchtech regarding corporate and financial communications, including the coordination of roadshows and investment conferences across key cities and building brand awareness with financial and social media outlets.

To further support formal communications across Birchtech Corp.’s multiple divisions, Stacey Hyatt has been promoted to Corporate Communications Manager. Ms. Hyatt has worked closely with the executive team since 2017 and will continue to support corporate strategies while managing the company’s marketing and communications.

Zimmerman commented: “ME₂C’s sorbent technologies have successfully captured mercury emissions for coal-fired utilities for more than a decade, ensuring compliance with a lower cost, less product, and lower environmental footprint than alternative technologies. Coal-fired power is a stable 21% of the U.S. power output, and over 36% of the global power mix, and is projected to remain a significant fuel source through 2050. After the U.S. coal-fired industry adopted ME₂C’s technology outside of patents, multiple lawsuits and settlements cleared the way for monetization of the Company’s IP with licensing agreements. Variations of ME₂C’s SEA® technologies are believed to be in use at nearly 40% of U.S. coal-fired power plants.”

Scargill added: “Birchtech is now focused on leveraging its experience and expertise in air emissions control to do the same for water treatment. WE2C is developing a comprehensive solution – combining world-class laboratory and consulting services with reactivation of granular activated carbon (“GAC”) – to effectively and affordably filter ‘forever chemicals’ and other contaminants from the nation's drinking water, supporting federal and state mandates imposed on potable water utilities. New PFAS/PFOS regulations are expected to impose significant financial burdens on U.S. water utilities, amounting to over $1.5 billion in expected annual compliance costs. WE2C adds a compelling incremental opportunity to Birchtech for our network of institutional investors and family offices worldwide.”

Richard MacPherson, Chief Executive Officer of Birchtech, added: “Our ME₂C core business line continues to drive robust revenues with gross margins in the mid-30% range, with significant upside potential from our successful post-trial outreach program, converting adopters of our technology to licensees or product supply customers. For WE2C, we are developing a superior activated carbon technology with expected completion by end of 2025, and have launched new R&D “design centers” geared toward enhancing research capabilities, optimizing water treatment processes, and supporting the continued development of activated carbon technologies.

“Under MZ’s guidance and support, we seek to gain a diversified base of long-term institutional shareholders as we intend to pursue a listing onto a major U.S. exchange. Having built a close relationship with MZ over the years, we look forward to working with Greg, Lucas, Ian and the entire MZ team as we strive to deliver sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders,” concluded MacPherson.
