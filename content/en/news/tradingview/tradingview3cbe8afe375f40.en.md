**Challenges and Risks**

Corning faces several significant risks that could impact its business operations and financial performance:

* **Inflationary Pressures and Supply Chain Disruptions**: Rising costs of commodities, raw materials, and logistics, along with supply chain disruptions, could negatively impact profitability. The company’s ability to pass on these costs to customers is uncertain and could affect demand.
* **Health Crisis Events**: Epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, have disrupted operations and supply chains, with potential for future impacts.
* **Concentration of Customer Base**: A small number of customers account for a large percentage of sales, posing risks if any key customer reduces orders or becomes insolvent.
* **Intellectual Property Risks**: Challenges in enforcing intellectual property rights and potential infringement claims could lead to loss of market share and increased costs.
* **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Dependency on IT systems exposes the company to risks of cyber-attacks, which could lead to operational disruptions and financial losses.
* **Environmental Regulations**: Compliance with stringent environmental laws could result in significant costs and operational restrictions.
* **Global Economic Conditions**: Economic uncertainties, including inflation and rising interest rates, could adversely affect consumer demand and the company’s financial results.
* **Foreign Currency Exposure**: Significant sales and operations in non-U.S. dollar currencies expose Corning to exchange rate fluctuations, impacting financial performance.
