* Japanese rubber futures fell for a third straight session on Tuesday amid mounting trade war tensions and improving weather in top producer Thailand, which eased supply concerns.
* The Osaka Exchange (OSE) rubber contract for July delivery , ended morning trade dropped 4.7 yen, or 1.27%, at 364 yen ($2.40) per kg.
* The rubber contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) for May delivery rose 185 yuan, or 1.07%, to 17,510 yuan ($2,396.14) per metric ton.
* The most active February butadiene rubber contract on the SHFE (SHBRv1) gained 150 yuan, or 1.03%, to 14,715 yuan ($2,013.66) per metric ton.
* U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on other countries over the next two days.
* Trump signed two proclamations to end all exclusions on steel and aluminium tariffs, while raising duties on both to 25%.
* These escalations in trade war tensions follow the sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports into the U.S. that kicked in last week, prompting retaliatory duties from Beijing.
* Meanwhile, China has pledged to boost residents' income to support spending and "vigorously" improve consumption, according to a cabinet meeting hosted by Premier Li Qiang, the national television broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday.
* From February 12-16, the northeast monsoon prevailing over the Gulf and the South will weaken, Thailand's meteorological agency said.
* Northeastern Thailand has gradually stopped harvesting and the reduction in supply will support prices, Chinese commodities data provider Longzhong Information said.
* Downstream tyre companies have returned to the market, though downstream demand recovery is slow, Longzhong added.
* The front-month rubber contract on the Singapore Exchange's SICOM platform for March delivery last traded at 197.6 U.S. cents per kg, up 0.3%.
