Metal stocks led losses in Indian shares on Monday after President Donald Trump said he would impose new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., in addition to further reciprocal tariffs.

The Nifty 50 was down 0.75% at 23,385.75 as of 10:14 a.m. IST, while the BSE Sensex shed 0.75% to 77,285.48.

Twelve of the 13 major sectors declined. The more domestically focussed smallcaps and midcaps fell about 1% each.

The metals index declined 3% after the U.S. president said on Sunday that he would impose 25% duties on steel and aluminium imports, on top of existing metals levies, along with reciprocal tariffs on all countries to match their tariffs.

Tata Steel and JSW Steel fell about 4% each, topping the list of Nifty 50 laggards.

Private lender HDFC Bank and oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries , the two heaviest stocks on the Nifty 50, lost about 1 and 1.5%, respectively.

The risk of fresh U.S. tariffs also fuelled losses in the rupee, which dropped to a lifetime low on Monday.

"Investors are worried about the uncertainty induced by frequent shifts in policy of the U.S. government regarding tariffs," said Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities.

Lacklustre third-quarter earnings and uninspiring management commentary have also weighed on investor sentiment, Chouhan said.

Among individual stocks, state-run explorer Oil India fell 4% after reporting third-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates as lower selling prices weighed.

Shipping Corporation of India lost 5.5% after posting a lower December-quarter profit.

Water treatment plant maker VA Tech Wabag rose 5.3% after winning an order worth $364 million and posting a higher quarterly profit.

($1 = 87.9010 Indian rupees)
