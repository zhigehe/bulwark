China's consumer price inflation is likely to stay low for longer as holiday boosts fade, Barclays economists say. Headline CPI rose in January, likely in part due to the timing of the Lunar New Year, when goods and services prices tend to rise, Ying Zhang and others say. What's more, at 0.5% the print is still well below the average level of 3% when LNY also fell in late January, they add. Core CPI also remained subdued by historical standards. The economists see 2025 CPI inflation at 0.4% given tariff hikes, structural headwinds and the absence of developed markets-like demand-side stimulus. A U.S.-China trade war would, on balance, have a deflationary effect, they expect, as pressure on exports would exacerbate China's overcapacity issues. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)
