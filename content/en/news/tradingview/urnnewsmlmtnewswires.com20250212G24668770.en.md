S&P Global Ratings has given a B+ long-term foreign currency issue rating to Mongolia's planned US dollar senior unsecured note issuance, according to a Tuesday release.

The notes serve as the sovereign's obligations and rank equally with its other debt obligations, the rating agency said.

Mongolia will channel the proceeds from the note issuance for a tender offer on its US dollar bonds due 2026 and 2028, S&P said.
