PSG Equity's $6 billion PSG VI fund is 28% larger than its predecessor, which gathered $4.7 billion, including the firm's general partner commitment. "Buyout Firm PSG Equity Collects $8 Billion for Tech Deals," at 7 a.m. ET, incorrectly excluded the general partner commitment, saying the new fund is 33% larger than its predecessor and the earlier fund had gathered $4.5 billion. Also, PSG uses artificial intelligence to identify and build a database listing more than 6 million companies. The article incorrectly said the database lists tech companies.
