The UK’s 10-year gilt yield fell slightly below 4.7%, as investors worry about global growth after US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat, this time targeting all steel and aluminum imports.

Trump announced that he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US, escalating his trade policy.

Just a week earlier, he announced tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, but suspended them for its neighboring countries the following day.

On the monetary policy front, strong labor data gave the Federal Reserve more leeway to delay rate cuts.

In the UK, the Bank of England cut interest rates to 4.5% and slashed its growth forecast for the year to 0.75%.

At the same time, the BoE raised its inflation forecast to 3.7% from 2.8%, signaling the difficulty of cutting rates amid persistent inflation.

Despite having already reduced rates three times since August, traders still expect about 60bps of additional easing this year.
