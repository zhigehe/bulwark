The U.K. Debt Management Office is likely to launch the new March 2035 gilt via syndication on Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note. The bond is likely to attract strong demand given its favorable valuation, RBC says. "Tuesday's transaction also marks the peak in gilt supply concentration for the quarter and hence the supply schedule will start to be supportive of gilt crossmarket outperformance into the end of March," the analysts say.
