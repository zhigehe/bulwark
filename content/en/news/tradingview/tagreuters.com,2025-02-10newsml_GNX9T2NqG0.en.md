Supports recent results from other projects using PyroGenesis plasma torches showing lower energy usage, reduced CAPEX, and faster production rates.

MONTREAL, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — PyroGenesis Inc. (“PyroGenesis”) (http://pyrogenesis.com) (OTCQX: PYRGF) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes advanced all-electric plasma processes and sustainable solutions to support heavy industry in their energy transition, emission reduction, commodity security, and waste remediation efforts, announces that recent data from a current contract confirms that PyroGenesis plasma torches posted significantly lower operational energy requirements. Savings of up to 45%, when compared to legacy diesel burners, have been obtained in destroying PFAS (often called “forever chemicals”). This contract has been disclosed previously (discussed most recently in the December 3, 2024 press release) and the name of the client remains anonymous for confidentiality and competitive reasons. This new data, combined with other recent results, highlights how a transition from fossil fuels to PyroGenesis plasma torches can generate both significant OPEX and emission reduction advantages.

These latest results are consistent with those obtained in other test installations where PyroGenesis plasma torches were used. In controlled tests carried out by PyroGenesis for similar applications in the aluminum sector, including those conducted as part of a contract with Constellium, one of the world’s largest aluminum transformation and recycling companies (press release dated April 10, 2024), to benchmark plasma torches against equivalent-power fossil-fuel burners, PyroGenesis’ plasma torches have achieved improvements of up to 45% reduction in global energy consumption, with a range of 10-45% reduction depending on the type of operation (e.g. melting, remelting or holding furnaces). These same tests also revealed up to 30% reduction in melting time (i.e. they melt faster, which translates into higher productivity).

Separately, tests using PyroGenesis plasma torches in casting ladle heating demonstrated energy reduction of 80% when compared to the energy requirement to power the furnaces with the pre-existing natural gas burners. This project was previously disclosed in the April 17, 2024 press release.

“These latest results, which have been confirmed across several projects under very different conditions, have significant implications for our torch offerings,” said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. “First, a solid business case can be made to transition to all-electric PyroGenesis plasma torches from an energy savings perspective alone, and any positive environmental impact (such as CO2 reduction) would be just icing on the cake. Second, with the reduced energy requirement as a result of using PyroGenesis torches, companies can now contemplate building smaller equipment (for the same capacity), reducing costs further for the same project. Third, the reduced aluminum melting time means companies can raise production levels, generating higher and faster output. Increasing production rates by up to 30% from the same production footprint implies processing more output which in turn directly impacts revenues and profitability. As I said, the advantages from using PyroGenesis’ plasma torches create a solid business case apart from the concurrent positive environmental impact of doing so. It is for these reasons that we say that ‘PyroGenesis is working to make sustainability sustainable.’”

PyroGenesis’ development of plasma torches for use in high temperature industrial processes is part of its three-vertical solution ecosystem that aligns with economic drivers that are key to global heavy industry. Plasma torches for use in industrial furnaces are part of PyroGenesis’ **Energy Transition and Emission Reduction** vertical, where fuel switching to PyroGenesis’ electric-powered plasma torches helps heavy industry reduce energy costs, fossil fuel use, and emissions. The other verticals are **Waste Remediation** and **Commodity Security and Optimization**.
