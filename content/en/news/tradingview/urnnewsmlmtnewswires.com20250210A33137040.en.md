(Updates with recent stock movement of steel and aluminum companies in the first and last paragraphs.)

Stocks of steel and aluminum majors, such as Cleveland-Cliffs and US Steel , advanced in recent Monday trading, following Trump's announcement of new tariffs on the metals.

In an interview with reporters aboard Air Force One, US President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will impose fresh 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the country.

According to the president, the steel and aluminum tariffs, which will be announced Monday, will be followed by "reciprocal tariffs" on Tuesday or Wednesday.

"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way," Trump said.

Cleveland-Cliffs shares were up nearly 14% and US Steel shares were 4.1% higher in recent trading Monday.
