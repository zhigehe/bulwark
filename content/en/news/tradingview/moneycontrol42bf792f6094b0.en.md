Shares of Balaji Amines reeled under selling pressure, plunging as much as 5 percent on February 13 after the company's operational performance took a sharp hit in Q3.

The company's EBITDA margin contracted sharply to 14.3 percent in the December quarter, down from 19.1 percent in the year ago period. The drag on margins was driven by a fall in volumes and capital expenditure projects.

Aside from that, the company's overall earnings performance in Q3 also remained weak, further weighing down sentiment for the stock. Net profit dropped 32.8 percent on year to Rs 33.20 crore, down from Rs 49.40 crore in the year ago period.

A similar trajectory panned out for the company's topline as revenue fell 18.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 312.40 crore.

At 09.30 am, shares of Balaji Amines were trading at Rs 1,522 on the NSE.(This is a developing story, please come back for more.)
