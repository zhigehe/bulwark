TC BioPharm said Monday it completed dosing for the first group B patient in the Achieve Phase 2B UK trial assessing TCB008 in acute myeloid leukemia.

The first group B patient received the dose in October, the company said, adding the person has received all four planned doses of TCB008 and is expected to get an additional fifth dose.

Meanwhile, enrollment of a second group B patient has also been started, the company said, adding group B recruitment is also continuing at sites in the UK.

"The therapy has been well-tolerated with no unexpected events or toxicities observed and promising efficacy results observed in some patients, with additional data being collected and analyzed," said TC BioPharm Chief Executive Bryan Kobel.

The company expects to complete enrollment in the second group in H1Â 2025, and data readout is expected later this year, Kobel said.

The company's shares were down past 6% in recent trading.
