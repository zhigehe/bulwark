The dollar index continued its recent decline, holding below 108 on Thursday, despite a hotter-than-expected US CPI report.

Data released on Wednesday showed that both annual headline and core inflation accelerated to 3% and 3.3%, respectively, surpassing forecasts of 2.9% and 3.1%.

On a monthly basis, both headline and core inflation also exceeded expectations, rising by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.

These figures reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate policy, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating before Congress that the central bank is in no rush to ease policy.

As a result, markets have adjusted expectations, now anticipating just one quarter-point rate cut from the Fed this year.

Traders are now focusing on Thursdayâ€™s weekly jobless claims and producer inflation data for further market direction.
