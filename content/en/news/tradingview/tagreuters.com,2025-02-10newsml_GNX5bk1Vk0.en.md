* Cutting-Edge Cardiac Research: Novoheart’s CTScreen™ system has been installed at UMC Utrecht, equipping Regenerative Medicine Center with advanced high-throughput tools to accelerate human cardiac disease modeling and therapeutic screening, including both drug candidates and gene editing approaches
* Driving Innovation: This installation paves the way for future co-development projects with UMC Utrecht, advancing human-based research and cardiac regenerative technologies

BOSTON and UTRECHT, Netherlands, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Medera Inc. (“Medera”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on targeting difficult-to-treat or currently incurable diseases with significant unmet needs, and Novoheart, its wholly owned pre-clinical subsidiary pioneering human-based cardiac tissue engineering for disease modelling and drug screening, are pleased to announce the installation of their state-of-the-art CTScreen™ platform at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht).

This milestone equips the Regenerative Medicine Center Utrecht with a leading-edge system to model human cardiac diseases, develop therapies, and transform preclinical cardiac research. UMC Utrecht researchers will leverage CTScreen™ to study disease-specific mechanisms, screen therapeutic candidates, and optimize drug safety using Novoheart’s human-based assays.

The CTScreen™ system supports Novoheart’s renowned "mini-Heart™" platform, enabling automated screening of bioengineered human cardiac tissues that accurately mimic heart function. Using a standard 96-well format, the system can evaluate up to 96 tissue samples at a time, allowing early detection of therapeutic effects and significantly accelerating the development process. This installation builds upon Novoheart’s successful collaborations with global leaders like AstraZeneca and Curi Bio, while advancing the goals of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 through human-based alternatives to traditional methods.

"This technology enables unparalleled precision in understanding cardiac conditions," said Kevin Costa, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Novoheart. "With UMC Utrecht’s expertise in regenerative medicine, we anticipate breakthroughs that will transform cardiovascular research."

“Our team is excited to bring the CTScreen™ system into our facility,” said Joost Sluijter, Ph.D., Director of the Heart and Lung Division within the Regenerative Medicine Center Utrecht. “This adds much-needed capabilities for measuring human cardiac tissue contractility, advancing our efforts in studying disease mechanisms and accelerating translation to clinical trials for patients with familial cardiomyopathies and other heart diseases that lack effective treatments.”

“The installation at UMC Utrecht represents not only an expansion of Novoheart’s reach, but also an exciting step in strengthening our partnership with this world-renowned institution,” concluded Ronald Li, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Medera. “Together, we are exploring innovative possibilities in cardiac regeneration technologies that have the potential to redefine what’s possible in heart disease treatment. While today’s announcement marks a key milestone, we look forward to sharing more exciting developments soon as our collaboration deepens.”

On September 5, 2024, Medera and Keen Vision Acquisition Corporation ("KVAC") (Nasdaq: KVAC, KVACW), announced they had entered into a definitive merger agreement.

Medera (www.medera.bio) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on targeting difficult-to-treat or currently incurable diseases with significant unmet needs, utilizing next-generation gene and cell-based approaches in combination with bioengineered human-based technology (including the mini-Heart platform). Medera operates via the two preclinical and clinical business units, Novoheart and Sardocor, respectively.

Novoheart capitalizes on the world's first and award-winning "mini-Heart" Technology for revolutionary disease modelling and drug discovery, uniquely enabling the modelling of human-specific diseases and discovery of therapeutic candidates free from species-specific differences in accordance to the FDA Modernization Act 2.0. Novoheart's versatile technology platform provides a range of state-of-the-art automation hardware and software as well as screening services, for human-specific disease modelling, therapeutic target discovery and validation, drug toxicity and efficacy screening, and dosage optimization carried out in the context of healthy and/or diseased human heart chambers and tissues. Global pharmaceutical and academic leaders are using Novoheart's technology platform for their drug discovery and development purposes. The Novoheart platform has facilitated and accelerated the development of Sardocor's lead therapeutic candidates that are currently in clinical trials.

Sardocor is dedicated to the clinical development of novel next-generation therapies for Medera. Leveraging Novoheart's human-based drug discovery and validation platforms, Sardocor aims to expedite drug development and regulatory timelines for its gene and cell therapy pipeline. Sardocor has received Investigational New Drug (IND) clearances from the FDA for three ongoing AAV-based cardiac gene therapy clinical trials targeting Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) with the Fast Track Designation, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-induced Cardiomyopathy (DMD-CM) with the Orphan Drug Designation. Additionally, Sardocor's pipeline includes four preclinical gene therapy and three preclinical small molecule candidates targeting various cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular diseases.
