By Ian Walker

John Wood Group said it is reviewing all financing options and is in talks with its lenders as most of its debt facilities are due to end in October, and that it had a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter.

The FTSE 250-listed energy-services company said Friday that it expects to report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year ended Dec. 31 of between $450 million and $460 million and adjusted EBIT of $205 million to $215 million.

The board has taken actions to mitigate the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter, including cancelling executive and employee bonuses and managing working capital at year end, it said.

Due to these actions, the board expects double-digit adjusted Ebitda and adjusted EBIT growth for the year ahead, but negative free cash flow of $150 million to $200 million.
