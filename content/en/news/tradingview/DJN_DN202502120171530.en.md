Palm oil prices are lower in early Asian trading, tracking overnight weakness in soybean oil on the Chicago Board of Trade, says David Ng, a trader at Kuala Lumpur-based Iceberg X. Palm olein's softness on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is likely weighing down palm oil prices further, he adds. However, he doesn't expect the price weakness to persist, given Malaysia's low palm oil stock levels. According to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, end-January palm oil stocks were 7.6% lower on month to 1.58 million tons. Ng pegs support for crude palm oil futures at MYR4,550/ton and resistance at MYR4,700/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 6 ringgit lower at 4,615 ringgit/ton.
