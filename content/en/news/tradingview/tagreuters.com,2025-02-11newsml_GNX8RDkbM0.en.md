WORCESTER, Mass., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Mustang Bio, Inc. (“Mustang” or the “Company”) today announced that it has received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing.

In addition, as a result of the closing of the public offering announced by the Company on February 10, 2025, the Company believes that it has a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). The Company is awaiting a formal compliance determination from Nasdaq, however, and there can be no assurance that the Company will receive the determination.
