\*\* Shares of United States Steel rise 4.6% to $41.06

\*\* U.S. President Donald Trump is considering allowing Japan's Nippon Steel to complete its $14.9 billion buyout of U.S. Steel, CBS News reports

\*\* Approval of the transaction is not definite, and Trump has not changed his mind on the sale, report says citing sources

\*\* U.S. Steel and Nippon did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments

\*\* Nippon had clinched the deal to buy U.S. Steel in 2023, but the merger has since faced opposition from the powerful Steelworkers' union as well as politicians

\*\* Former U.S. president Joe Biden had blocked the acquisition on national security grounds in January, but delayed an order for Nippon to abandon its bid for U.S. Steel until June

\*\* Trump had also opposed the deal before

\*\* As of last close, U.S. Steel shares up 20.6% YTD
