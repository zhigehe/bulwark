Undercut by softer sales and profitability, business conditions in Australia somewhat soured in January, according to the NAB Monthly Survey, released on Tuesday.

"Business conditions declined in January, reversing last month's gains. Trading conditions and profitability eased, while employment rose marginally," said NAB.

The overall business conditions index in January sank to a 3, from a 6 reading in December.

The index for the subcategory of sales fell to a 6 in January from a 10 in December, while that for profits declined to a negative 2 from a 4.

However, the subcategory for employment improved to a 5 in January from a 4 in December, and business confidence rose to a 4 from a negative 2, added NAB.

Also declining in January from December were business capital outlays, exports and orders, said the NAB.

Australian businesses reported that labor costs rose at a 1.8% quarterly rate in January, rising from the 1.4% rate logged in December.

Meanwhile, business purchase costs rose at a 1.1% quarterly rate in January, down from 1.4% rate in December, reported the NAB.

By industry sector, there "was a significant decline in mining conditions," reported NAB. "Declines were also recorded in retail (partially reversing the December uptick), finance, business and property, and recreational and personal."

In contrast, the wholesale, transport, utilities and manufacturing sectors "saw an improvement," said NAB.

Given the survey results, the outlook is for a somewhat sluggish economic expansion in Australia, said NAB.

In January, while "the level of demand has remained resilient, growth in the economy likely remains soft and while recent consumption data for late Q4 shows some rebound in household spending, this will likely need to be maintained before conditions recover more broadly," concluded the NAB.
