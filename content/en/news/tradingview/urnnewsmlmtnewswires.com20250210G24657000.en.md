Caracal Gold said Monday it raised 440,000 pounds sterling through a share subscription and has issued 146,666,666 new ordinary shares at 0.003 pound sterling apiece.

The subscribers will receive one warrant per share exercisable at 0.0042 pound within three years and the proceeds will be used as working capital for Kilimapesa Gold Mine, the UK-based gold mining company said.

Further, the company also secured a $200,000 loan from Chief Executive Robbie McCrae and nonexecutive director Stefan Muller, at 10% interest above the Bank of England rate, with repayment due by December 2026.
