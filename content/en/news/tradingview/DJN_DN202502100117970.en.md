By Katherine Hamilton

Southwest Airlines named Tom Doxey its next chief financial officer.

Doxey, who most recently served as president of Breeze Airways, is set to start the role on March 10, Southwest said Monday. During his time at Breeze, the company launched a loyalty program and co-branded credit card.

He previously served in leadership roles at United Airlines, including as CFO of operations.

Doxey succeeds Tammy Romo, who is set to retire in April after about 13 years in the role. The airline announced her departure in January.

The airline has fallen behind some of its competitors since the pandemic. Southwest said in September it would focus on a turnaround strategy, including doing away with its signature unassigned seating and providing extra legroom for customers willing to pay for it.

In 2023, Romo had total compensation of $5.6 million, including a base salary of about half a million dollars.
