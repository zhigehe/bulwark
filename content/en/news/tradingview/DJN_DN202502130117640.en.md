Tariffs won't be a problem for Corsair Gaming, executives say on a call with analysts. The gaming technology company moved the production of most of its U.S.-bound products out of China five years ago during President Trump's first round of tariffs, at which time the company also "planned further actions in case more or expanded tariffs were announced," CFO Michael Potter says. It doesn't have any factory locations in Canada or Mexico. Corsair guides for better-than-expected revenue in 2025, including the effect of tariffs. "Depending on the news coming up next, that might change the picture," COO Thi La says, "but at the moment, we feel pretty good about our supply chain." Shares rise 17%. (connor.hart@wsj.com)
