LightPath Technologies Inc., a leading provider of optical and infrared components, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of the fiscal year. The report highlights the company's financial performance and operational developments, reflecting its strategic shift towards higher-margin products and complete optical subsystems.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Revenue, net**: $7.4 million, an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 1%, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, driven by increases in sales of visible components and engineering services.
* **Gross Profit**: $1.9 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 11%, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, with a gross margin of 26% due to differences in product mix and manufacturing yield issues.
* **Operating loss**: $(2.5) million, compared to $(1.8) million in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased SG&A and new product development costs.
* **Net loss**: $(2.6) million, or $(0.07) per share, compared to $(1.7) million, or $(0.05) per share, for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, attributed to lower gross profit and higher interest expense.
* **Loss per common share (basic)**: $(0.07), compared to $(0.05) in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, reflecting the increased net loss.

**Business Highlights**

* **Revenue Segments**: The company reported revenue from four main product groups: infrared components, visible components, assemblies and modules, and engineering services. Infrared components saw a decrease due to reduced sales of Germanium-based products, while visible components increased due to higher sales to defense customers. Assemblies and modules experienced a decline, and engineering services saw significant growth driven by a contract with Lockheed Martin.
* **Geographical Performance**: Revenue from the United States increased, driven by defense industry sales, while revenue from Europe decreased. Sales in China and other Asian countries remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in China.
* **New Production Launches**: The company completed construction of additional tenant improvements at its Orlando Facility, expanding its operational capacity.
* **Future Outlook**: The company is transitioning from a component manufacturer to a supplier of imaging subsystems and systems, leveraging its proprietary technologies like BlackDiamond glass. It anticipates significant growth and higher profitability through this strategic shift and recent acquisitions, such as Visimid Technologies.
