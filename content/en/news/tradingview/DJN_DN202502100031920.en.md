An estimate of the neutral interest rate by the European Central Bank, or by any other model, is of questionable value in gauging the degree of policy restriction, BNP Paribas Markets 360 analysts say in a note. The neutral rate is a theoretical rate which neither stimulates nor restricts the economy.
