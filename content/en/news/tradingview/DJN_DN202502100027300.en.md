U.K. government bonds, or gilts, appear more attractive than U.S. Treasurys on a relative-value basis, TD Securities rates strategist Pooja Kumra says in a note ahead of a syndication of 10-year gilts due this week. "Relative-value wise we see value in holding gilts versus U.S. Treasurys...as a tactical trade." Yields on 10-year gilts have dropped from the multi-decade highs of around 4.90% in mid-January and last trade at 4.463%, Tradeweb data show. "Gilts have outperformed on crossmarket basis," she says. Investors are ready to buy the new 10-year 4.5% gilt at this week's syndication, where GBP10 billion is expected to be sold, Kumra says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
