Kelly Services Inc., a global leader in workforce solutions, has released its 2024 Form 10-K report, detailing significant financial and operational highlights, strategic initiatives, and the challenges faced over the past year. The report underscores the company's strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth specialties, particularly in North America, following the sale of its European staffing operations.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Revenue from services:** $4,331.8 million, a decrease of 10.4% from 2023, primarily due to the sale of EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by the acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners (MRP).
* **Gross profit:** $882.6 million, a decrease of 8.2% from 2023, with a gross profit rate increase of 0.5 percentage points to 20.4%, favorably impacted by the sale of EMEA staffing operations and the acquisition of MRP.
* **Earnings (loss) from operations:** $(15.1) million, compared to $24.3 million in 2023, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges and lower revenue.
* **Net earnings (loss):** $(0.6) million, compared to $36.4 million in 2023, reflecting lower pretax earnings and impairment charges.
* **Gross profit rate:** 20.4%, increased by 0.5 percentage points from 2023, driven by changes in business mix and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

**Business Highlights**

* **Revenue Segments:** Kelly operates through four specialized business units: Professional & Industrial, Science, Engineering & Technology, Education, and Outsourcing & Consulting. Each unit focuses on specific market needs, with P&I delivering staffing services in industrial and clerical specialties, SET providing specialized skills in science and technology, Education offering staffing and therapy services to educational institutions, and OCG delivering global talent supply chain solutions.
* **Geographical Performance:** In 2024, Kelly completed the sale of its European staffing operations, focusing its efforts on North American markets while maintaining global MSP and RPO capabilities. This strategic move aligns with the company's focus on higher-margin, higher-growth specialties in North America.
* **Sales Units:** In 2024, Kelly, along with its supplier partners, placed over 400,000 workers globally, demonstrating its extensive reach and capability in workforce solutions.
* **New Product Launches:** Kelly introduced the Kelly Now mobile application in the U.S. to enhance its local delivery model, meeting the needs of both clients and talent more effectively.
* **Future Outlook:** Kelly is committed to capturing a greater share of growth and enhancing efficiency across the company. The acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners and Children's Therapy Center in 2024 is expected to expand Kelly's capabilities in technology, telecommunications, government specialties, and therapy practices, contributing to future growth prospects.

**Strategic Initiatives**

* **Strategic Initiatives:** In 2024, the company undertook significant strategic initiatives to streamline operations and focus on higher-margin, higher-growth specialties. This included the acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners, LLC (MRP) to enhance staffing and consulting solutions in technology, telecommunications, and government specialties, and the acquisition of Children's Therapy Center (CTC) to expand the therapy practice in the Education segment. The company also completed the sale of its European staffing operations and the Ayers Group to focus on North American staffing and global Managed Service Provider (MSP) and recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) solutions.
* **Capital Management:** The company generated $214.8 million from financing activities in 2024, primarily driven by net borrowings of $239.4 million on credit facilities for the acquisition of MRP. It repurchased $10.0 million of Class A common stock under a $50.0 million share repurchase program approved in November 2024. Dividends paid per common share were $0.30 in 2024, consistent with 2023. The company maintained a debt-to-total capital ratio of 16.2% at year-end 2024, with $110.0 million available on its revolving credit facility and $4.5 million on its securitization facility.
* **Future Outlook:** The company plans to continue focusing on capturing growth opportunities in North America and enhancing efficiency across its operations. It expects to leverage its credit facilities, including an accordion feature to increase borrowing capacity, to support strategic investments and maintain liquidity. The company anticipates further structural shifts to improve growth prospects and EBITDA margin profiles as it moves forward into 2025 and beyond.

**Challenges and Risks**

* **Competitive and Market Risks:** Kelly Services operates in a highly competitive and fragmented staffing industry, facing intense price competition and low barriers to entry. The company is also exposed to risks related to technological advances, such as automation and artificial intelligence, which may disrupt the labor market and reduce demand for human capital.
* **Regulatory Risks:** Kelly's operations are subject to extensive government regulation, which may impose additional costs or restrict service offerings. Compliance with competition laws and potential changes in immigration policy could impact the ability to recruit non-citizen workers.
* **Macroeconomic Risks:** Kelly's business is significantly affected by macroeconomic conditions, with demand for staffing services fluctuating based on economic activity. The company faces risks related to stock price volatility, competitive pressures, and technological disruptions.
* **Operational Risks:** In 2024, Kelly faced challenges from the sale of its EMEA staffing operations and the acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners, impacting revenue and gross profit. The goodwill impairment charge related to Softworld highlights the risk of market conditions affecting financial performance.
* **Market Risks:** Kelly is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may impact financial results when translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars. The company also faces risks related to interest rate changes, which could affect the cost of borrowing and financial flexibility. Additionally, geopolitical events and regulatory changes in international markets may pose challenges to Kelly's global operations.
