USA Compression Partners, LP, a leading provider of natural gas compression services, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company has reported record revenues and significant growth in key financial metrics, reflecting strong operational performance and favorable market conditions.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, USA Compression Partners achieved record total revenues of $245.9 million, a notable increase from $225.0 million in the same period of 2023. Net income also saw a substantial rise to $25.4 million, compared to $12.8 million in the previous year. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA of $155.5 million, up from $138.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) was $96.3 million, an increase from $79.9 million in the same period last year, with a DCF coverage ratio of 1.56x.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Operationally, USA Compression Partners reported a record average revenue-generating horsepower of 3.56 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, up from 3.41 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The average revenue per revenue-generating horsepower per month also reached a new high of $20.85, compared to $19.52 in the previous year.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Looking ahead, USA Compression Partners has outlined an expansion capital range of $120 million to $140 million for 2025, focusing on contracted new horsepower unit additions. The company also anticipates benefits from the Energy Transfer shared services model, which is expected to reduce back-office costs and enhance operational management.

**Management's Perspective**

Clint Green, President and CEO of USA Compression Partners, commented on the results, highlighting the record-setting financial performance driven by improved operational efficiencies and favorable market conditions. Green expressed optimism about the macroeconomic backdrop, particularly the constructive price of oil and the anticipated growth in natural gas volumes, which are expected to benefit the company's assets in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.
