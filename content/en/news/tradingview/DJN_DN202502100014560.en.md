Nordic markets are seen opening slightly higher, with IG calling the OMXS30 up 0.3% at around 2648. Last week ended with stock market declines in the U.S., while developments in Asia this morning are mixed, SEB analysts note. "New threats of tariffs are high on this week's agenda and will be digested by the markets," they write. According to various statements from President Trump over the weekend, steel and aluminum will be subject to 25% tariffs, and he plans to make an announcement about reciprocal tariffs later this week, SEB says. In addition, tariffs announced by China in response to previously increased U.S. tariffs, have now come into effect. Futures are pointing slightly higher in both Europe and the U.S. ahead of today's trading. OMXS30 closed at 2639.75, OMXN40 at 2609.19 and OBX at 1401.09. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
