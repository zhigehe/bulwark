Sera Prognostics said late Monday it priced an underwritten public offering of roughly 1.3 million class A common shares at $4 apiece and pre-funded warrants to buy roughly 11.3 million shares at $3.99 per warrant for expected gross proceeds of about $50 million.

The company has provided the underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional about 1.9 million shares. The offering is due to close on Wednesday.

Sera said it plans to use the net proceeds to support its commercial expansion in the US, preparations to expand operations in the EU and for general corporate purposes, among other things.
