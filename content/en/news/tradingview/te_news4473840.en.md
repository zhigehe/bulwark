US stock futures dipped on Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s signing of an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.

The move also includes the cancellation of exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers, stoking concerns about the potential for a wider trade war.

Investors are also bracing for key US economic data later this week, with the consumer inflation report set for release on Wednesday.

Additionally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify before Congress on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

In regular trading on Monday, the Dow gained 0.38%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.67% and 0.98%, respectively.

Technology stocks led the rally, with notable gains from Nvidia (up 2.9%), Palantir (up 5.2%), SMCI (up 17.6%), Broadcom (up 4.5%), and Uber (up 5.4%).

Steel and aluminum stocks also surged on the tariff news, with Cleveland-Cliffs jumping 17.9% and Nucor rising 5.6%.
