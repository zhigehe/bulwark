CoreCivic is looking at reopening its South Texas Family Residential Center, which closed in August. The closure contributed to the private prison operator missing Wall Street expectations with its 2025 outlook. But the Trump administration's strong demand for immigrant detention capacity could result in a reactivation of the center, company executives say on a call with analysts. CoreCivic usually takes four to six months to open a new facility, but it is looking to speed up that timeline to meet growing demand, and believes it could open the Texas center quickly because it hasn't been closed for long.
