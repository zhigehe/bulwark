(The Insurer) - CRC Group has strengthened its team with four new appointments throughout the United States.

David Schmidt joins the Philadelphia, PA office as underwriting team leader, bringing nearly 20 years of industry experience. He previously served as an underwriting specialist at Nationwide.

Jake Scherr has been appointed high net worth personal lines underwriter in Tampa, FL. With more than a decade of experience, he most recently worked as a senior private client underwriter at Burns & Wilcox.

Karen Jones takes on the role of underwriting team leader in the San Antonio, TX office, having previously held various underwriting positions at Texas Security General Insurance Agency.

Brandon Biagi joins CRC's Los Angeles, CA office as a broker. He previously served as vice president and sales director at Apogee Insurance Group, a Berkshire Hathaway company.

CRC stated that these appointments are part of a broader strategy to enhance its service capabilities for retail agency clients nationwide.

Last month, CRC announced that it had appointed Daniela Mills as national property practice group director, with the new hire joining after eight years at Lockton.
