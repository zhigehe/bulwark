KKR has raised around $14 billion for its North America buyout fund, moving past the halfway mark to its $20 billion goal, Bloomberg News reported late Wednesday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.

The firm is planning a first close, possibly this month, which would allow it to start investing and signal strong demand from limited partners, the media outlet reported.

KKR launched fundraising for its 14th round of the fund last June after collecting $19 billion in the previous round, according to Bloomberg.

KKR did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.

Shares of the company were down about 2% in recent trading.
