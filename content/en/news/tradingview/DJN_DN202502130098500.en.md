HSBC Research maintains its mildly positive conviction on core eurozone government bonds this month in anticipation of more rate cuts by the European Central Bank, says Chris Attfield in a note. "The signals coming from the ECB are sounding more dovish in our view, with more emphasis on the downside risk to growth and less on sticky domestic inflation," the European rates strategist says. The lower level of yields means that Bunds now offer less value than at HSBC Research's last publication, he says. Eurozone government bond yields fall, with the 10-year Bund yield down 5 basis points to last trade at 2.432%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)
