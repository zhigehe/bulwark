The CEO of Dutch staffing giant Randstad said on Wednesday "the headlines are bleaker than the reality" as some U.S. companies change their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies targeted by President Donald Trump.

Since taking office on Jan. 20, [Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) has issued a series of executive orders aimed at scrapping DEI initiatives across the federal government and the private sector.

Some of the largest businesses in the U.S., including Walt Disney and Amazon.com , have reportedly responded to these efforts by changing their DEI programs and removing references to them in their annual reports.

Randstad CEO Sander van't Noordende said companies were seeking to ensure their work environment was inclusive even as they move away from some initiatives deemed "problematic" in the light of the executive orders.

"We see companies stay the course on making sure they have an inclusive work environment where people feel a sense of belonging. And why? Because it's good for business," he told Reuters following the publication of Randstad's fourth-quarter results.

Trump's orders have been criticized by advocacy groups who say they might deepen inequities and undo decades of progress made to enshrine civil rights protections for marginalized groups.
