Materials stocks rose past 1.6% at midday Thursday, after iron ore prices strengthened overnight.

South32 reported Thursday that its earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to $0.08 from $0.012 per diluted share a year earlier. Revenue for the six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was $3.12 billion, up 25% from $2.51 billion in the same period a year earlier.

On the other hand, the utilities sector tumbled, shedding 1.6% as the price of oil fell.

US President Donald Trump discussed the war in Ukraine in phone calls with the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents, which could lead to an easing of supply constraints for oil, Reuters reported.

Origin Energy reported Thursday that its earnings per diluted share in the fiscal first half rose to AU$0.59 from AU$ 0.575 per diluted share a year earlier.

For its Australia Pacific LNG project, Origin Energy expects fiscal year production of 670 to 690 petajoules, compared with its previous guidance of 685 to 710 petajoules.
