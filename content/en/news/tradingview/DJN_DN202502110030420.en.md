By Colin Kellaher

Wesco International on Tuesday said it plans to raise its dividend by 10% this year to an annual rate of $1.82.

The increased payout would equate to 45.5 cents on a quarterly basis, up from 41.25 cents, and would represent an annual yield of about 0.98%, based on Monday's closing price of $185.30 for the Pittsburgh provider of business-to-business distribution, logistics services and supply-chain solutions.

Wesco last February raised its dividend by 10% to the current $1.65 annual rate.
