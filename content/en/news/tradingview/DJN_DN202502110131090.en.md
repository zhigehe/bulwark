Malaysia's palm-oil stocks could drop by another 7% on month to 1.48 million tons in February, due to continued low production and fewer working days, CIMB Securities analysts Ivy Ng Lee Fang and Lim Yue Jia say in a note. Malaysia's palm-oil stocks fell 7.5% on month in January. The continuation of the rainy season could further weigh on output, they add. The analysts believe CPO prices will remain firm due to low palm-oil stocks in key producing and consuming countries. CIMB maintains its 2025 CPO price forecast at MYR4,200/ton and expects stronger 4Q 2024 earnings from planters due to higher prices and stronger Indonesian production. CIMB keeps an overweight rating on Malaysia's agriculture & forestry sector, pegging SD Guthrie, IOI Corp. and Hap Seng Plantations as its top picks.(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
