Consumer inflation in the US accelerated last month on both sequential and annual bases, while core measures came in ahead of Wall Street's estimates, government data showed Wednesday.

The consumer price index increased 0.5% in January from 0.4% the month prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest reading compared with a 0.3% forecast in a Bloomberg-compiled survey. Annually, inflation accelerated to 3% from December's 2.9% pace, which was the Street's view for January.

"The moderation we saw in consumer inflation last summer is no longer visible now," BMO Chief US Economist Scott Anderson said in a note. "The problem for the (Federal Reserve) is this isn't just a one-month event, but looks like a real multi-month firming of inflation pressures."

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, accelerated to 0.4% in January from 0.2% the month prior, topping the consensus estimate for 0.3%. At the annual level, core inflation came in at 3.3%, surpassing the Wall Street's forecast of 3.1%.

"The first CPI reading for 2025 showed core inflation rising at its fastest pace in nearly a year, amid a further uptick in goods prices and ongoing stickiness in services inflation," TD Economics Senior Economist Thomas Feltmate said in a report.

Monthly food price growth rose to 0.4% from 0.3% in December, while energy price gains cooled to 1.1% from 2.4%, the BLS report showed. The increase in energy included a 6.2% jump in fuel oil prices. Annually, food prices increased by 2.5%, while the energy index gained 1%.

The latest consumer inflation report is likely to make the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee more cautious and patient regarding future rate cuts than it already is, Anderson said.

On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank does "not need to be in a hurry" to adjust monetary policy as the economy remains strong, reiterating prior remarks that it was in no rush to cut interest rates.

Late last month, the FOMC kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged following three straight cuts.
