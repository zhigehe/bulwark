Aluminum futures edge lower in the morning Asian session as traders digest President Trump's announcement on Monday of global 25% tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel to the U.S. Any tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for U.S. manufacturers, ANZ Research's commodity strategists say in a note. "This would most likely be in form of higher U.S. Midwest premiums rather than a sustained uplift in the LME price" of aluminum futures, although this can't be ruled out, the strategists add. The LME three-month aluminum futures contract is 0.2% lower at $2,652.00 a metric ton.(ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
