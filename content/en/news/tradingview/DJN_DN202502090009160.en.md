By Ashley Wong

The Super Bowl got another jolt of star power as actors Jon Hamm and Bradley Cooper arrived to welcome the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles onto the field for kickoff.

Hamm, from St. Louis, is a longtime superfan of Chiefs, while Cooper, born and raised in Pennsylvania, is an Eagles devotee who played a diehard fan in the 2012 film "Silver Linings Playbook." Cooper brought his food truck to New Orleans last week, slinging Philly cheesesteaks blocks away from the Caesars Superdome.
