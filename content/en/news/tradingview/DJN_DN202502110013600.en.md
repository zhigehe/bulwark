UniCredit's outlook for the years ahead and its better-than-expected results shouldn't disappoint the market, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says in a research note after the Italian bank's fourth-quarter print. The earnings beat was solid due to better net interest income, while some items were weaker than estimates, analysts Hugo Cruz and Ben Maher write. "We think that is mainly "front loading" ahead of 2025," they say, referring to expenses taken during the end of last year. The net profit, net revenue and return on tangible equity guidance for 2025 surpasses current consensus estimates for the year, they add. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)
