Germany’s 10-year Bund yield fell to 2.47% after rising 12 basis points over the past two days, as investors grew optimistic about an end to the Ukraine war.

US President Donald Trump spoke separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday and directed US officials to start negotiations to end the nearly three-year conflict.

Meanwhile, Trump's trade policies remain in focus, with the European Union vowing to retaliate against US tariffs on European steel and aluminum.

On the monetary policy front, stronger-than-expected US inflation reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will delay rate cuts, while the European Central Bank is still expected to continue easing.

In Germany, political uncertainty may persist after the February 23 federal election, as opposition leader Friedrich Merz and his CDU/CSU bloc will likely need to form a coalition to secure a majority.
