Lincoln Minerals said new analysis has confirmed overlooked copper and base metals potential at the Minbrie project in South Australia, according to a Wednesday filing with the Australian bourse.

The mining firm said that historical drilling overlooked the copper and base metals potential of the project as they were exclusively focused on magnetite exploration, the filing said.

However, it is now analyzing about 263 drill holes over 12 kilometers in strike with geochemical and geophysical data to refine future exploration targets.

The historical drilling results secured in 2011 included 29.5 meters at 0.8% copper, 7.5% lead, 1.9% zinc, and 9 grams per tonne of gold from 131 meters.
