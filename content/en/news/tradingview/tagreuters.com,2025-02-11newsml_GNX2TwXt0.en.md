NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Arvinas, Inc. , a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating a new class of drugs based on targeted protein degradation, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided a corporate update.

"We made significant progress across our pipeline in 2024, all of which we believe supports our mission to improve the lives of patients with debilitating and life-threatening diseases," said John Houston, Ph.D., Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer and President at Arvinas. "Looking ahead, we are on the cusp of a number of firsts, including results from VERITAC-2, the first ever Phase 3 clinical trial of a PROTAC. In addition, we plan to present the first-in-human data for our most advanced neuroscience program, ARV-102, which we believe will highlight the potential value our PROTAC degraders can offer to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In the coming months, we look forward to sharing additional updates emerging from our pipeline and PROTAC platform.”

**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones and Expectations**

**Vepdegestrant: Oral PROTAC ER degrader**

As part of Arvinas global collaboration with Pfizer, the companies plan to:

* Announce topline data for the VERITAC-2 Phase 3 monotherapy clinical trial evaluating vepdegestrant in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in a topline press release 1Q25 and present full results of the trial at a medical conference in 2025.

  + First-line Phase 3 combination trial with Pfizer’s novel investigational CDK4 inhibitor, atirmociclib.
  + Second-line Phase 3 combination trial with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
  + With the prioritization of the vepdegestrant plus atirmociclib combination for the first-line setting, the VERITAC-3 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating vepdegestrant plus palbociclib in the first-line will not proceed beyond the study lead-in.
* Continue to collect safety and efficacy data from ongoing TACTIVE-U sub-studies evaluating combination of vepdegestrant with abemaciclib, ribociclib, or samuraciclib (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT05548127, NCT05573555, and NCT06125522) and submit key data for presentation at medical conference.

**Financial Guidance**

Based on its current operating plan, Arvinas believes its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, is sufficient to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2027.

**Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results**

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Position: As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1,039.4 million as compared with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of $1,266.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $227.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to cash used in operations of $237.4 million (net of $150.0 million received from the Novartis agreements), inclusive of a one-time cash termination fee in the amount of $41.5 million related to the termination of our laboratory and office space lease with 101 College Street LLC in August 2024, the purchase of lab equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.8 million and $0.4 million of long term debt repayments, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8.3 million, unrealized gains on marketable securities of $4.1 million and proceeds from disposal of equipment of $0.1 million.

**Research and Development Expenses:**  Research and development expenses were $348.2 million and $83.3 million for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2024, respectively, as compared with $379.7 million and $95.2 million for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses of $31.5 million for the year was primarily due to a decrease in external expenses of $41.7 million, partially offset by an increase in compensation and related personnel expenses of $11.2 million, which are not allocated by program. External expenses include program-specific expenses, which decreased by $32.1 million, driven by decreases in our vepdegestrant and bavdegalutamide (ARV-110) programs of $27.9 million and $18.1 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in our ARV-102 and ARV-393 programs of $10.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, and our non-program specific expenses, which decreased by $9.6 million. The decrease in research and development expenses of $11.9 million for the quarter was primarily due to a decrease in external expenses of $9.9 million, compensation and related personnel expenses of $0.5 million, which are not allocated by program, and other expenses of $1.5 million. External expenses include program-specific expenses, which decreased by $14.2 million, primarily driven by decreases in our vepdegestrant, luxdegalutamide (ARV-766) and bavdegalutamide (ARV-110) programs of $13.6 million, $6.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in our ARV-102 and ARV-393 programs of $5.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and our non-program specific expenses of $4.3 million.

**General and Administrative Expenses:**  General and administrative expenses were $165.4 million and $34.1 million for the year and quarter ended of December 31, 2024, respectively, as compared with $100.3 million and $27.0 million for the year and quarter ended of December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $65.1 million for the year was primarily due to a loss on the termination of our laboratory and office space lease with 101 College Street LLC in August 2024 of $43.4 million as well as increases in personnel and infrastructure related costs of $9.0 million, professional fees of $8.1 million and in developing our commercial operations of $4.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $7.1 million for the quarter was primarily due to increases in developing our commercial operations of $2.6 million, personnel and infrastructure related costs of $2.2 million and professional fees of $1.8 million.

**Revenue:**  Revenue was $263.4 million and $59.2 million for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2024, respectively, as compared with $78.5 million and $(43.1) million for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue of $184.9 million for the year was primarily due to revenue from the Novartis agreements of $162.4 million, an increase in revenue from the Vepdegestrant (ARV-471) Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer of $21.7 million related in part to adjustments to revenue in 2023 from changes in contract estimates and year over year increases in revenue of $2.8 million and $2.2 million from the Bayer Collaboration Agreement and the Pfizer Research Collaboration Agreement, respectively, primarily due to changes in estimates in 2023 of the performance period duration under the agreements resulting from updated research timelines, offset by a decrease of $2.5 million of previously constrained deferred revenue related to our Oerth Bio joint venture, and a decrease of $1.8 million of revenue under the Restated Genentech Agreement as the performance period had concluded in 2023. The increase in revenue of $102.3 million for the quarter was primarily related to an increase in revenue from the Pfizer ARV-471 Collaboration Agreement totaling $63.8 million, primarily due to adjustments in 2023 to revenue from changes in contract estimates, as well as revenue from the Novartis agreements of $40.3 million, offset by a decrease in revenue from Bayer of $1.6 million related to the termination of the Bayer Collaboration Agreement in August 2024.

**Investor Call & Webcast Details**

**About Vepdegestrant**

Vepdegestrant is an investigational, orally bioavailable PROTAC protein degrader designed to specifically target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) for the treatment of patients with ER positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. Vepdegestrant is being developed as a potential monotherapy and as part of combination therapy across multiple treatment settings for ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.

In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted vepdegestrant Fast Track designation as a monotherapy in the treatment of adults with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with endocrine-based therapy.

**About Arvinas**
