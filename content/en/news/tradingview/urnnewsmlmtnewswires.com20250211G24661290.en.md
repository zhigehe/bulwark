SGS is expecting continued growth in 2025 after reaching record sales levels in the previous year helped by the resumption of its acquisitions strategy.

The Swiss testing, inspection and certification company forecasts organic sales to increase between 5% and 7%, with a 1% to 2% contribution from bolt-on acquisitions to its annual sales growth and an at least 30 basis points improvement in adjusted operating income margin on sales. At the same time, it reiterated its financial targets for 2027, with 5% to 7% in annual organic sales growth.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the 2025 outlook is "broadly consistent with current consensus expectations for both organic revenue growth and reported [adjusted operating income] margins."

SGS logged sales of 6.79 billion francs for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, up from 6.62 billion francs a year ago. Attributable profit also rose to 581 million francs from 553 million francs. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 6.81 billion francs in sales, with a net income of 604.8 million francs.

The group completed 11 bolt-on acquisitions during the year, boosting its revenue base by a total annual contribution of more than 71 million francs. SGS said these M&A deals "almost entirely" compensated for its disposals in 2023. Reflecting the "successful" restart of its M&A activity, the company has already announced three more acquisitions in 2025.

The company's sales performance also benefited from strong growths in its testing and inspection, and certification segments. Organic sales growth in these two business divisions came in at 7.6% and 6.2%, respectively.

Regarding SGS' abandoned merger talks with Bureau Veritas , RBC thinks "the round trip stock price performance YTD suggests the market does not view the proposed deal as having been driven by defensive considerations. We are less sure and see a number of challenges ahead for the industry which, we think, leaves SGS vulnerable to a pull back on a 12-month view."
