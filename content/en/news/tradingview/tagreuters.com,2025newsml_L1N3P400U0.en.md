Key points:

* KOSPI rises, foreigners net sellers
* Korean won strengthens against dollar
* South Korea benchmark bond yield rises

Round-up of South Korean financial markets:

\*\* South Korean shares climbed for the third consecutive session on Thursday and hit the highest levels in three months, as automakers surged on optimism about a potential exemption from U.S. tariffs, while steelmakers saw a rebound.

\*\* The benchmark KOSPI was up 10.88 points, or 0.43%, at 2,559.27, as of 0043 GMT, hitting its highest intraday level since early November 2024.

\*\* U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose reciprocal tariffs as soon as Wednesday evening on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports, after introducing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday.

\*\* Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said that he believes Trump is considering exemptions to reciprocal tariffs that include the automobile and pharmaceutical industries.

\*\* South Korea's free trade agreement with the United States could help mitigate its exposure to reciprocal tariffs threatened by Trump, economists said.

\*\* Steelmaker POSCO Holdings rose 4.3%, while Hyundai Steel jumped 6.8%.

\*\* Of the total 939 traded issues, 478 shares advanced, while 376 declined.

\*\* Foreigners were net sellers of shares worth 222.1 billion won ($152.91 million).

\*\* The won was quoted at 1,452.9 per dollar on the onshore settlement platform , 0.21% higher than its previous close at 1,456.0.

\*\* The most liquid three-year Korean treasury bond yield (KR3YT=RR) rose by 1.4 basis points to 2.666%, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose by 2.3 basis points to 2.905%.
