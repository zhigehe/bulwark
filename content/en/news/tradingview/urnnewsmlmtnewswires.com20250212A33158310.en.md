US benchmark equity indexes were mostly lower intraday after official data showed that consumer inflation accelerated in January.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4% at 44,407.3 after midday Wednesday, while the S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 6,051.8. The Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 19,645.1. Among sectors, energy saw the biggest drop, down 2.3%, while consumer discretionary paced the gainers.

In economic news, the US consumer price index increased 0.5% in January from 0.4% the month prior, while the annual measure accelerated to 3% from 2.9%. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, accelerated to 0.4% sequentially and 3.3% annually last month, topping the Street's views.

"The first CPI reading for 2025 showed core inflation rising at its fastest pace in nearly a year, amid a further uptick in goods prices and ongoing stickiness in services inflation," TD Economics said. Separately, BMO said the report is likely to make the Federal Reserve more cautious and patient regarding future rate cuts than it already is.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the latest CPI report fit with an overall picture that policymakers are "close but not there" on getting inflation back to their 2% goal, MarketWatch reported.

On Tuesday, Powell said the Fed does "not need to be in a hurry" to adjust monetary policy as the economy remained strong.

The official US producer price report for January is due Thursday.

The US 10-year yield was up 9.8 basis points at 4.64% intraday, while the two-year rate added 8.2 basis points to 4.37%.

In company news, Biogen guided for a decline in earnings and revenue for 2025 amid ongoing challenges in its multiple sclerosis product category. The company's shares fell 5.9%, the steepest decline on the Nasdaq and among the steepest on the S&P 500.

Kraft Heinz offered a downbeat full-year earnings outlook as the food and beverage company's fourth-quarter revenue fell more than the Street's expectations. Its shares dropped 3.4%, among the worst Nasdaq performers.

CVS Health posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and projected higher 2025 earnings on a year-over-year basis. The healthcare company's shares jumped 16%, the top gainer on the S&P 500.

Cisco Systems , Trade Desk , Robinhood Markets and Reddit are among the companies scheduled to report results after Wednesday's closing bell.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped 2.5% to $71.47 a barrel intraday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its global oil demand projections for 2025 and 2026, while flagging uncertainty from the impact of potential tariffs.

"It remains to be seen how and to what extent potential tariffs and other policy measures will play out" for the global economy, the cartel said. "So far, they are not anticipated to materially impact the current underlying growth assumptions."

Gold was down 0.1% at $2,928.80 per troy ounce, while silver added 1.3% to $32.76 per ounce.
