The unexpected surge in the United Kingdom's activity in December lifted quarterly gross domestic product growth to 0.1% quarter over quarter in Q4 while consensus was for a 0.1% quarter-over-quarter contraction and will put talk of a technical recession to bed, said Berenberg.

A rise in services output supported by signs of a strengthening in consumer spending over Christmas raised GDP by 0.4% month over month in December, well above the consensus forecast of a 0.1% month-over-month increase in output, noted the bank.

This will reassure the Bank of England that the economy isn't suffering from a sudden slump in demand, and as such reduces the chance of an interest rate cut at the next meeting on March 20, state Berenberg. Admittedly, the expenditure breakdown flags some cause for caution, with government spending and volatile stock building rising the most.

However, looking ahead, the bank expects supportive consumer fundamentals and increasing government consumption to help quarterly GDP growth pick up further from 0.1% quarter over quarter in Q4 to an average of 0.3% quarter over quarter this year.

Soft consumer sentiment didn't hold consumers back from spending over the festive period. As the services sector accounts for 80% of U.K. output, that will need to continue if GDP growth is to pick up to 0.3% quarter over quarter and reach the bank's forecast of 0.9% year over year for the full year of 2025.

The first estimate of the expenditure breakdown for Q4 was less encouraging than the output data, added Berenberg. Domestic demand continued to expand, but that was exclusively due to increases in government spending and stock building.

Admittedly, given the strength of consumer-facing services at the end of the quarter, it seems likely that household spending will be revised over time. Meanwhile, net trade remained a major headwind.

But the trade deficit has already widened from 1.5% of GDP to 3.5% over the past year and a half, so the bank thinks that much of the adjustment to the past appreciation of sterling against the euro is now behind.

As a consequence, solid domestic demand should allow the economy to gain some momentum this year, accoridng to Berenberg.
