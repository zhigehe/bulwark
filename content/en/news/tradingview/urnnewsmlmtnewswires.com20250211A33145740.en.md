The Canadian dollar (CAD or loonie) experienced "significant" turbulence following United States President Donald Trump's recent tariff threats, noted Desjardins.

However, CAD has since regained some ground after a tentative agreement was reached between U.S. and Canadian leaders. This surge in volatility underscores the ongoing impact of President Trump's tariff policies on currency markets, said Desjardins.

The bank's year-end USDCAD forecast of 1.48, one of the highest on the Street, factors in a 10% tariff hike in the second half of the year. Should the tariff increase be larger or occur sooner, it would present an upside risk to the forecast.

The analysis of Desjardins indicates that the Canadian dollar would depreciate by 5% against the US dollar (USD) for every 10% permanent increase in the effective tariff rate.
