After setting a record high, front-month gold inches back--falling 0.1% to $2,912.50/oz, but still above that key $2,900 a troy ounce mark. The outlook for gold remains strong as analysts forecast gold to climb above the $3,000/oz mark for the first time ever. "Gold continues to benefit from robust physical market demand as well as the reacceleration in inflation," says Trevor Yates of Global X. Gold ETFs are also strong, Yates adds, with gold miner ETFs outperforming gold and "offering more leverage to changes in the underlying commodity price." SPDR Gold shares are down 0.2%.
