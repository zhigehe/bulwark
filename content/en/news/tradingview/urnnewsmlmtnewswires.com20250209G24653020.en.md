Terramin Australia lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court of South Australia against its decision to dismiss the firm's application for judicial review, according to a Monday Australian bourse filing.

The firm had filed an application for review after the South Australian Minister for Energy and Mining decided to decline the mining lease and miscellaneous purposes license applications for the Bird in Hand gold project in South Australia.

The appeal maintains that the minister's actions were contrary to the department for energy and mining's technical assessment, which concluded that the project could be developed with no adverse environmental or socioeconomic impacts.
