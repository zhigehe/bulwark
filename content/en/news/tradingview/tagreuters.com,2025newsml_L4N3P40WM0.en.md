STOCKS:

The benchmark BSE Sensex was down 0.04% at 76,138.97, while the broader NSE Nifty 50 index declined 0.06% to 23,031.40, hit by mounting concerns over the United States imposing new tariffs and prospects of fewer rate cuts in the world's largest economy.

The Indian rupee was little changed versus the U.S. dollar at 86.90, wedged between gains in regional peers and importers' dollar demand.
