Elliott Investment Management said on Tuesday it has built a stake of more than $2.5 billion in U.S. refiner Phillips 66 , and plans to push for operational changes as well as the sale of its midstream business.

In March, the activist investor disclosed a $1 billion stake in the company, following which Phillips 66 laid out a performance improvement plan to boost shareholder returns and share price.

Elliott said that shares of Phillips 66 have lagged that of rival refiners, and they are trading at a substantial discount.

Phillips 66 shares rose 6.6% in premarket trading on Tuesday.
