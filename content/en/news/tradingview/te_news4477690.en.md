The FTSE 100 fell more than 0.5% on Thursday, underperforming its European counterparts as weak corporate earnings overshadowed better-than-expected economic data.

British American Tobacco saw the biggest drop, sliding up to 7.8%, as investors reacted to disappointing forward guidance despite in-line results.

Unilever also struggled, falling 6.4%, while Barclays lost over 4.5%, even after reporting strong earnings, announcing a share buyback, and exceeding expectations in its investment banking division.

On the positive side, the UK economy provided a positive surprise, growing 0.1% in Q4 instead of contracting as expected.

Decemberâ€™s monthly reading came in at 0.4%, well above the expected 0.1% and the highest since March.
