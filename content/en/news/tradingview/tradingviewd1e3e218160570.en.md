TEL INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS CORP, a leading provider of avionics test and measurement solutions, has released its Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and operational highlights, showcasing significant developments in both areas.

**Financial Highlights**

**Net Sales**: The company reported net sales of $2.97 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, marking a 24% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. This growth was driven by a mix of product sale customer demand and invoicing of the Navy Craft ECP.

**Gross Margin**: Gross margin for the quarter was $0.63 million (21%), down from $0.97 million (40%) in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to higher CRAFT component costs and increased fixed production costs.

**(Loss) Income from Operations**: The company reported a loss from operations of $(0.57) million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to an income of $0.25 million in the prior year. This was impacted by increased costs and expenses.

**Net (Loss) Income**: Net loss for the quarter was $(0.46) million, compared to a net income of $0.13 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily due to increased CRAFT ECP costs.

**Basic Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share**: The basic net loss per common share was $(0.17) for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.01 in the prior year, reflecting the net loss attributable to common shareholders.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments**: TEL INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS CORP operates in two main segments: avionics government and avionics commercial. The avionics government segment primarily involves the design, manufacture, and sale of test equipment to U.S. and foreign governments and militaries. The avionics commercial segment focuses on selling test equipment to domestic and foreign airlines and general aviation repair and maintenance shops.

**Geographical Performance**: For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the company reported $2,567,439 in sales from the United States and $404,698 from international markets. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, U.S. sales were $6,571,514, while international sales were $1,020,141.

**New Product Launches**: The company has developed the SDR/OMNI and SDR-OMNI/MIL products, designed to address both commercial and military markets. The SDR/OMNI product line supports a wide frequency range and is designed to replace multiple test sets with one handheld product. The SDR-OMNI/MIL adds SIF and TACAN test capabilities and has received positive reviews from the U.S. Department of Defense and international military customers.

**New Production Launches**: The company is preparing for the production of the new MADL test set for the F-35 program, with a $1.55 million order expected to commence production in the final quarter of fiscal 2025.

**Future Outlook**: TEL INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS CORP anticipates significant revenue and profit improvements starting in fiscal year 2026 due to the success of the SDR-OMNI product and the commencement of CRAFT ECP and MADL production. The company also expects to fulfill its $8.4 million open orders, which will support operations for the next 12 months.
