The benchmark KOSPI hovered around 2,539 points on Wednesday, pausing gains from the previous session as traders continued to weigh the impact of US tariffs.

On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions, set to take effect on March 4.

These tariffs are expected to erode the profitability of domestic steel exporters, as South Korea is a major steel supplier to the US. Adding to concerns, Trump suggested he may impose tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips, and pharmaceuticals—South Korea’s key export products.

Among major stocks, losses were led by chipmakers and index heavyweights Samsung Electronics (-1.6%) and SK Hynix (-1.4%), while shares of automakers and pharmaceutical companies also declined.

On the upside, Hyundai Industries jumped over 10%, leading the gains.
