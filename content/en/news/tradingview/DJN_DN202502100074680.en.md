High European natural-gas prices are helping to attract a rising share of LNG cargoes to the continent this year, analysts at Morgan Stanley say. So far in 2025, Europe has accounted for approximately 33% of global LNG imports, up from 19% in August and an average of 25% in 2024, according to the U.S. bank. "Low inventories, cold weather, and the end of pipeline flows through Ukraine have all increased Europe's call on LNG so far in 2025," the analysts say. The benchmark Dutch TTF contract is up 4.6% to 58.30 euros a megawatt hour in evening trade, the highest level in two years. Meanwhile, the JKM, the spot Asian LNG benchmark, trades at a $1 discount to the TTF, reflecting milder weather and softness in regional demand. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)
