Chinese stocks lost ground on Thursday, with the Shanghai Composite falling 0.3% to below 3,340 and the Shenzhen Component dropping 0.5% to 10,650.

The declines came as former President Trump’s latest tariff threats weighed on market sentiment.

On Wednesday, Trump announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on any country that charges duties on US imports, raising concerns of an escalating global trade conflict.

Additionally, Trump revealed he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping after taking office last month, though he provided no specifics on the discussions' timeline or content.

Investors in China also took profits following a strong rally fueled by optimism surrounding artificial intelligence.

Notable decliners included Sichuan Changhong (-5.3%), IEIT Systems (-4.3%), and Hand Enterprise (-10%).
