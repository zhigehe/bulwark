Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners II said late Monday it priced an initial public offering of 20 million units at $10 apiece.

The units will likely begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the "ATIIU" ticker from Tuesday. The offering will probably close on Wednesday, the special purpose acquisition company said.

Each unit comprises one ordinary share (ATII) and half of one redeemable warrant (ATIIW). A whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share.

The company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 3 million additional units to cover any over-allotments.
