(The Insurer) - Mapfre Re has appointed Javier San Basilio as general manager as part of a wider restructure of the business designed to sharpen the reinsurer’s strategic focus.

San Basilio, currently deputy general manager and CUO, will now take on direct coordination of the regional divisions and have responsibility for the development of large clients and brokers.

Mapfre Re said the appointment is part of an organisational restructure aimed at advancing its strategic objectives, including further development of the life business, a sharper strategic, commercial and technical focus, and stronger relationships with clients and brokers.

Under the new structure, Mapfre Re’s non-group business will be organised through two lines: non-life underwriting and life business.

Carmen Bueso will head up non-life underwriting and Maite González will lead life, encompassing the life, accident and health businesses.

“This new structure will facilitate a more agile response to market changes and client needs,” Mapfre Re said in statement on Monday.

The changes – which take effect on 1 March – also include the appointment of Ricardo Pérez as manager of the Iberia/Latin America regional area, with the executive also set to join Mapfre Re’s management committee.

Mapfre’s Asia Pacific region is led by Javier Sánchez Cea, with EMEA led by Mark Meyerhoff and North America by Carlos Sanzo.

Management of the business coming from the Mapfre Group remains unchanged with Fernando Utrilla at the helm.

A strategy, communication, sustainability and innovation area has also been created with the objective of projecting an integrated vision of all these areas, overseen by Juan Satrústegui.

“These changes will enable us to move forward with greater agility and ambition in the Mapfre Re strategy as we take on even greater challenges in the coming years. We’ll continue boosting the non-life business and drive the development of our life business, where we have a long way to go,” said Miguel Rosa, CEO of Mapfre Re.

It comes shortly after Rosa told this publication last month that Mapfre Re has an ambition to grow its gross written premiums by 5-10 percent in 2025, with the Spanish reinsurer actively seeking to expand its book of business in Asia and the US and diversify into new markets such as life insurance.

Speaking exclusively to The Insurer, Rosa said that the company was seeking to continue its healthy momentum in 2025 by boosting its gross written premiums from third-party sources in addition to the reinsurance on behalf of its parent Mapfre.
