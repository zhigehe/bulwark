The Gorman-Rupp Company, a leading designer and manufacturer of pumps and pump systems, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31,Â 2024. The company reported a modest increase in net sales and significant improvements in net income and adjusted earnings per share.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Gorman-Rupp reported net sales of $162.7 million, a 1.3% increase compared to the same period in 2023. The company's net income for the quarter was $11.0 million, or $0.42 per share, up from $9.0 million, or $0.34 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest expense decreased significantly due to debt refinancing and reduced debt levels.

For the full year 2024, net sales were $659.7 million, a slight increase of 0.1% from 2023. Net income for the year was $40.1 million, or $1.53 per share, compared to $35.0 million, or $1.34 per share, in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share for 2024 were $1.75, up from $1.37 in 2023. The company also reported a decrease in total debt by $43.0 million, further improving its leverage.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Gorman-Rupp saw notable sales increases in the municipal and repair markets, driven by domestic flood control and wastewater projects. However, these gains were partially offset by decreases in the fire suppression, petroleum, construction, and industrial markets. The company's gross profit for the fourth quarter was $49.2 million, with a gross margin of 30.2%, down from 31.7% in the same period of 2023.

For the full year, gross profit was $204.3 million, with a gross margin of 31.0%, up from 29.8% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved cost of materials and the realization of selling price increases, partially offset by higher labor and overhead expenses.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In 2024, Gorman-Rupp completed a series of debt refinancing transactions, which significantly reduced interest expenses and extended debt maturities. The company also increased its dividend for the 52nd consecutive year and declared its 300th consecutive quarterly dividend in January 2025. Capital expenditures for 2024 were $14.3 million, with plans for approximately $20.0 million in 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Scott A. King, President and CEO, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting improvements in gross margin and operating income, as well as a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share. He also noted the significant reduction in debt and interest expenses, positioning the company well for future growth. King emphasized the company's strong incoming orders and healthy backlog, which bode well for 2025.

**Future Outlook**

Gorman-Rupp's outlook for 2025 remains positive, with expectations of continued benefits from infrastructure spending and strong demand for flood control and storm water management. The company aims to maintain its focus on long-term profitable growth.
