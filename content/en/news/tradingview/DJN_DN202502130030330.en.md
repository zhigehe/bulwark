U.S. Treasurys pare some of Wednesday's weakness that was prompted by above-consensus inflation data. The 2- and 10-year Treasury yields fall 3 basis points to 4.338% and 4.606%, respectively, according to Tradeweb. On Wednesday, the 2-year Treasury yield increased 7.5 basis points to 4.365%, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 10 basis points to 4.637%, according to Tradeweb. "With inflation still above target and the Federal Reserve on hold, fundamentals take center stage," says Global X's Scott Helfstein in a note. However, large and small companies see strong sales and earnings growth so far this quarter and higher rates aren't yet much of an impediment, the head of investment strategy says.
