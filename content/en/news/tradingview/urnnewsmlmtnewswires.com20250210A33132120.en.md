Boeing plans to eliminate around 400 positions on NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket program by April, multiple news outlets reported Saturday, citing an email from a Boeing spokesperson.

The layoffs are reportedly tied to changes in NASA's Artemis project and cost estimates, with Boeing working to move affected employees to other operations within the company.

The job cuts total one-third of the workforce assigned to the SLS project, which has faced delays, cost overruns, and technical challenges, according to media reports.

NASA said the SLS rocket remains a key part of its Artemis campaign, which aims to return humans to the moon and eventually reach Mars, news outlets reported.

Boeing did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.
