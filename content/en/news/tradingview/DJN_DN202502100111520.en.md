MARKET SNAPSHOT

U.S. stocks ended higher as markets allowed for tariff fatigue. Treasury yields were mixed ahead of Fed Chair Powell's Congressional hearings and U.S. inflation data later this week. Oil prices were higher as traders — for now — downplayed the impact of U.S. tariffs. The dollar was stronger while gold set another record close — cracking the $2,900 barrier for the first time.

MARKET WRAPS

EQUITIES

U.S. stocks rose as investors shrugged off the risk that President Trump's planned steel and aluminum tariffs could ignite a trade war.

The Nasdaq Composite gained 1%, leading major indexes. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%.

Steelmaker stocks were among the biggest winners after Trump said over the weekend that he would impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and hinted at reciprocal import duties against U.S. trading partners. McDonald's shares climbed 4.7% on the back of its latest earnings report.

Earlier Monday, Chinese shares ended higher, supported by software and telecom stocks. China's three largest telecom providers surged after they incorporated DeepSeek's model in their offerings. Investors are digesting Trump's plan to impose additional tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.6% higher, the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 1.1%, and the ChiNext Price Index was 0.4% higher. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed 1.8% higher, supported by tech stocks.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed flat, as gains in chemical and select electronics stocks helped offset losses in trading houses. The broader market index, Topix, fell 0.2% to 2733.01.

Stocks in Australia slipped, as the S&P/ASX 200 Benchmark Index fell 0.3% — the second consecutive day of decreases. The blue-chip S&P/ASX 20 Index, which includes the country's major banks and iron-ore miners, dropped 0.4%.

New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.2% lower, dragged into the red by shares of its largest companies. Shares of six of New Zealand's seven largest companies by market capitalization finished lower.

COMMODITIES

Oil futures settled higher, finding support after three straight weekly declines that took crude to its lows of 2025, with traders appearing to shake off worries about President Trump's latest threats around tariffs.

West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 1.9% to settle at $72.32 a barrel. April Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 1.6% to $75.87 a barrel.

For now, "oil traders are responding to the headlines very cautiously," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com.

Threats by President Trump to apply or raise tariffs on trading partners around the globe have traders jumping into gold futures - with the front-month February gold contract closing up 1.6% to $2,914.30 a troy ounce. It's a new record for front-month gold, cracking the $2,900 barrier for the first time.

TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES

Trump's Next Round of Tariffs-25% on Steel and Aluminum-Won't Be So Easily Averted

President Trump said he plans to impose 25% tariffs Monday on imports of steel and aluminum, part of the structural change to the country's trade system that the president promised on the campaign trail.

He also said he plans to make an announcement about reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday. "Very simple, they charge us, we charge them," Trump said Sunday. Those will go into effect "almost immediately," he said.

"Tariffs are going to help. Tariffs are going to make it very successful, " Trump said as he previewed the new levies on Sunday afternoon to reporters flying with him aboard Air Force One en route from Florida to Louisiana, where he attended the Super Bowl.

Elon Musk-Led Group Makes $97.4 Billion Bid for Control of OpenAI

A consortium of investors led by Elon Musk is offering $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, upping the stakes in his battle with Sam Altman over the company behind ChatGPT.

Musk's attorney, Marc Toberoff, said he submitted the bid to OpenAI's board of directors Monday.

The unsolicited offer adds a major complication to Altman's carefully laid plans for OpenAI's future, including converting it to a for-profit company and spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure through a joint venture called Stargate. He and Musk are already fighting in court over the direction of OpenAI.

McDonald's U.S. Sales Drop as Customers Spend Less

McDonald's U.S. store sales and earnings fell as the burger chain dealt with the fallout of an E. coli outbreak hitting its domestic business last year.

The company said its U.S. same-store sales declined 1.4% in the three months ended Dec. 31, driven in part by customers spending less money per visit. A slowdown in the pace of price increases across restaurants also contributed.

The chain's fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share trailed analysts' expectations. Some investors had feared steeper declines, and were upbeat about the company's recovery in many international markets.

TD Bank to Sell Investment in Charles Schwab

Toronto-Dominion Bank will exit its investment in Charles Schwab, the Canadian bank's first big move under new Chief Executive Raymond Chun to shore up its business following a costly money-laundering scandal.

TD will offer its 10.1% stake in Schwab through a registered stock offering plus the sale of shares back to the brokerage and money-management firm. A chunk of the proceeds will be used by TD for a big share buyback program of its own.

Chun, a TD veteran who took the helm this month as part of an accelerated shakeup of the lender's top ranks, said the decision was made to sell the remaining stake in Schwab as part of a sweeping review of TD launched last year that has been evaluating capital allocation.

Elliott Takes Stake in Struggling Oil Giant BP

Activist hedge fund Elliott Management has built a stake in British oil major BP and will push for transformational changes to improve the company's performance, according to people familiar with the investment.

The U.S. hedge fund, which manages around $70 billion in assets, is one of Wall Street's most influential investors, known for pressuring companies to fire management, break apart and spin off businesses, all with the goal of increasing shareholder returns.

The size of Elliott's BP stake couldn't be learned. Elliott is encouraging BP to consider more dramatic moves than it has made so far to restore the once venerable company's fortunes, the people said.

Spirit AeroSystems to Declare Going Concern Amid Boeing Takeover

Spirit AeroSystems Holdings' management expects to make a going concern disclosure in its 2024 Form 10-K annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, anticipating to conclude that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue due to its cash flow and liquidity position.

The forecast comes as the fuselage supplier swung to a loss and posted lower revenue in its preliminary fourth-quarter results.

Formed by a spinoff from Boeing in 2005, Spirit AeroSystems projected a gross loss of $413 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a gross profit of $291 million a year earlier. Revenue is expected to fall 8.3% to $1.66 billion.
