U.S. natural gas futures start the week higher as another cold spell makes its way over much of the U.S., driving up expected heating demand. "While a combination of supportive weather, the largest storage deficits since 2022 and bullish technicals may offer short-term upside, resurgent production levels hitting fresh all-time highs over the weekend threaten medium-term weakness," EBW Analytics says in a note. Nymex natural gas is up 2.5% at $3.391/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)
