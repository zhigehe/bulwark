Most of Fitch Ratings' covered Indian corporates have low to moderate exposure to long-term climate-linked transition risks by 2035, according to a Monday release.

Companies in sectors like technology, power transmission and distribution, and renewable generation account for 64% of those with a climate vulnerability signal (Climate.VS) of under 45, Fitch said.

Meanwhile, corporates in areas such as oil refining and marketing, oil and gas production, steel, and auto supply have Climate.VS of 45 or higher.

These companies have higher exposure to credit-relevant climate transition risks, which serve as additional factors in rating reviews, Fitch said.

The rating agency said climate risks currently have a minimal influence on its rated portfolio, and most Indian corporates have net zero goals and include renewable energy in their plans.

However, these plans comprise notable shifts in business models and product offerings, which could hit companies' profitability, Fitch said.
