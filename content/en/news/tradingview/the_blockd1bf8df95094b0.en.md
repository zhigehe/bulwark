Stablecoins could emerge as one of the most efficient means of payment in a global economy as legacy payment systems struggle to keep pace with AI agents, blockchain technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), according to Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) co-founder Rune Christensen.

Christensen emphasized the convergence of AI and blockchain as a transformative force. In an interview with The Block, he explained that AI agents, being inherently digital, will seamlessly integrate with stablecoins like Sky Protocol’s USDS to optimize payments, savings and overall financial management. USDS — an upgraded version of DAI and a new “Savings Standard” within Sky Protocol — is the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization and is designed to maintain a stable value of one U.S. dollar. It offers a savings rate of 8.75%, with AI agents involved in the decision-making process to manage the collateral to sustain this rate.

****The role of AI agents in finance****

The Sky Protocol co-founder said that one of the defining characteristics of AI agents is their hyper-rational approach to financial decision-making. Unlike human-centered management, AI agents can continuously assess risk-return trade-offs and optimize collateral allocation strategies, Christensen said. He added that this makes blockchain-native stablecoins an ideal option.

"For AI systems, transparency is key," Christensen said. "They need to know in real time what the backing of a stablecoin is. With USDS, AI agents can verify its collateral, assess the yield, and execute transactions based on real-time liquidity profiles."

He added that AI will increasingly serve as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain systems.

"Most AI systems, when interacting with legacy financial systems, will still use blockchain technology to bridge the gap," said Christensen. "Tokens representing real-world assets (RWAs) will play a crucial role in this transition."

Christensen described a developing economic order, combining AI agents and the Internet of Things (IoT), that is expected to drastically transform industries by enabling highly automated, data-driven decision-making, personalized experiences and optimized operations across various sectors.

****AI-managed collateral and the 8.75% savings rate on USDS****

One of the features of Sky Protocol’s USDS is the use of AI agents not just to facilitate payments but also to manage the collateral supporting the stablecoin’s savings rate. With a return exceeding 8%, Christensen sees AI agents as helping ensure the long-term sustainability of these yields by dynamically optimizing collateral allocation.

"Sky Protocol’s ecosystem is designed to cater to hyper-rational actors like AI agents, enabling them to tap into collateral for financial opportunities," Christensen said. "Through Sky Atlas, AI agents have full access to system parameters, collateral allocations, and real-time audits. They can instantly analyze whether the savings rate is stable, assess risks, and adjust holdings accordingly."

**Stablecoin market cap hits all-time high**

According to DeFiLlama data, the current stablecoin market capitalization has surpassed $224 billion, an all-time high. On the Solana blockchain, the market cap of stablecoins more than doubled in January, rising from $5.1 billion on New Year's Day to $11.4 billion by month’s end.   Additionally, CoinGecko data shows that Circle’s USDC reached a $56.3 billion market cap on Monday. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin with $141.9 billion in circulation today, has grown its market cap by over $4 billion in the past 30 days.![](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/the_block:d1bf8df95094b-c7671b02ef37a9e9feaee4c557e7031f-resized.jpeg)

As AI agents become increasingly embedded in financial systems, Christensen envisions a future where digital-native payment systems using stablecoins are the norm.

"Stablecoins will be crucial for AI-driven financial automation," he said. "To optimize transactions and savings, AI must leverage stablecoins—it’s the only way to create a seamless, efficient digital economy."
