Earnings Call Highlights

The below topics have been answered by CEO Mark Coulter and CFO Cameron Barnsley.

1H25 earnings: “Temple & Webster has delivered another exceptional result for the half, supported by a strong November and December promotional period. Revenue grew 24% year on year to $314 million, driven by both growth in new customers and higher average order values.”

Consumer sensitivity to promotions: “These positives were offset slightly by increased promotional activity although we do see strong supplier support for these promotions.”

Share buyback program: “Given our substantial cash reserves and expected future cash flows, I thought it would be prudent to start to outline our capital management priorities… Our short to medium-term priorities are focused on maintaining a healthy level of cash to manage liquidity, whilst also providing us optionality to invest in organic growth, strategic capabilities, accretive growth opportunities and to return surplus capital to shareholders over time.”

Shift to online retail trends: “As we all know, our industry is undergoing a once in a generation shift from offline to online. We are already the online market leader of furniture and homewares, and we believe now is the time we can widen that lead.”

AI integration:

* “More than 60% of all customer pre and post-sales support interactions were handled by AI. This has meant that our customer care costs have halved in two years.”
* “We have now also fully rolled out our AI-calculated shipping engine, which has improved revenue per visit by 3%.”
* “The benefits of our investments in AI across the business will help drive margin improvements.”

Logistical efficiencies: “We’ve increased our shipping price accuracy through AI-driven initiatives by 17%, leading to delivered margin improvements.”

Market share growth: “Our share of the B2C furniture and homewares market needs to grow from the current 2.9% to only 4.2% to achieve our mid-term goal of $1 billion in annual sales.”

Cash flow strength: “Free cash flow generation of $33 million during the half was up a significant 61% on PCP.”

Expansion into Home Improvement: “The Home Improvement category reached $20 million in the half, up 41% versus the PCP… Our strategy is simple. We want to build our product range, provide better prices than our offline competitors, and improve the content customer experience to become the dominant online retailer in this market.”

Analyst Q&A Highlights

Can you provide more color on the 16% growth compared to last year’s 35%? Was performance marketing reduced, and did Australia Day impact sales?

* "How we're tracking is towards our ideas and expectations, I think we're not saying that there's anything going wrong."
* "Consumers are really responding to the most promotional periods."
* "We kind of make up some of the growth during those promotional periods when that promotion period is the strongest."
* "We have built that margin flexibility from the first half. So we have quite a lot of levers to pull both in the promotional and price and also marketing."
* "Every retailer in the country is hanging out for an interest rate cut... any improvement to the macro can only help us as well."

Customer acquisition cost has declined, but ROI also fell. Is this due to reduced brand spend, or are there other factors at play?

* "Definitely a big part of that is the brand spend, which we knew as predicted."
* "We will invest more in our digital channels as well."
* "Even with that extra investment, the customers on average are still profitable enough on the first order."
* "We still delivered a record 4.2% EBITDA margin at the scale for the half."
* "We are able to both invest in customer acquisition, which is important right now, and deliver good numbers."

Given the strong first-half margin, why reiterate guidance at 1-3% when the numbers suggest you could hit the upper end? Are you reserving flexibility for marketing spend?

* "The reiteration of guidance really relates to what we've said in the outlook statement today."
* "We intend to use our levers—price, promotions, and marketing—to drive growth, but in a tactical and disciplined way."
* "This is a pretty typical profile for our business where you do see a slightly higher EBITDA margin in first half versus second half."
* "We do expect some initialisation in the fixed cost line to come into the second half."

You spent AUD 5 million on brand marketing in the first half. Given the full-year guidance of AUD 12-18 million, how much of the second-half spend is committed?

* "We were probably a little bit lighter than what we'd anticipated in terms of turning on that brand spend."
* "We do expect to see an increase in that brand marketing spend in the second half."
* "The amount we spend will depend on market conditions, balancing performance, and macro trends."
* "One of the key takeaways from our media mix modeling was that we should be more consistent with brand investment going forward."

Are you now more comfortable investing in inventory for your home improvement and growth adjacency categories, given initial caution around stock levels?

"Yes, we are already going deep on the inventory with sales history, but the main goal is actually to broaden the range. So it's not just about depth of the inventory, it's about the breadth of the range. Now, that will still take time. There will be winners and losers, we'll still do a small volume, which is possible to test and then build up the history."

Average order value is up 67% year-on-year. What’s driving the increase?

"The bulk of the AOV increase is really a mix. The furniture continues to outperform with higher price-selling items—that’s the main driver. There’s also a bit of shipping price increase again due to mix, but also because we’re pricing it more accurately."

What are the next steps in AI-driven efficiencies and conversion improvements?

"We’ve already halved our customer care costs while scaling, and now we’re shifting AI applications to focus more on conversion rate drivers."
