\*\* Bernstein initiates newly spun-off tabletop game publisher Asmodee at "market perform", pointing to its good product proposition and capex-light financial profile

\*\* However, it stays neutral on valuation grounds; it sets a PT of SEK 100 vs Friday's closing price of SEK 105

\*\* It says Asmodee's core products in the EUR 13 billion ($13.4 billion) tabletop games market could benefit from push back against screen time or growth in tabletop communities

\*\* It highlights the company's #2 global market share, only behind Hasbro , including strong positions in Europe and its own distribution network spanning more than 100 countries

\*\* Bernstein says Asmodee is well positioned to achieve 5% average organic sales growth over the next five years

\*\* However, it says the trading card game market is volatile and notes Asmodee has around 20% sales exposure to Pokemon and around 15% to Magic trading cards

\*\* "A loss of one of these relationships could be significantly detrimental (although they are established relationships)," it adds about the third-party brands

($1 = 0.9678 euros)
