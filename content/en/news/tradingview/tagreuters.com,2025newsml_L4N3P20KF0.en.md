Indian government bond yields ended lower on Tuesday as investors welcomed the Reserve Bank of India's move to double its debt purchases scheduled for this week, with some expecting more such transactions going forward.

The benchmark yield (IN067934G=CC) ended at 6.6983%, compared with its previous close of 6.7128%.

The RBI announced after market hours on Monday that it would buy twice the amount of securities planned earlier under its next tranche of open market operations on February 13 to cushion the liquidity deficit in the banking system.

The central bank will purchase bonds worth 400 billion rupees ($4.61 billion) against 200 billion rupees announced previously without altering the securities that it has chosen to buy.

Heavy intervention from the central bank in the foreign exchange market on Monday and Tuesday could have been the primary reason for the RBI raising its debt purchases, traders said.

"This reaffirms the commitment of the RBI to increase liquidity and we expect further OMOs in the coming weeks," said Debendra Kumar Dash, senior vice president of treasury at AU Small Finance Bank.

The RBI has already bought bonds worth 200.20 billion rupees through an OMO auction, infused 500 billion rupees through a 56-day variable rate repo and around 440 billion rupees through a dollar/rupee buy/sell swap.

It is also scheduled to buy bonds worth another 200 billion rupees on February 20.

"The benchmark bond yield should come down to 6.60% levels amid assurance for liquidity. We also expect the inflation number to point towards further rate cuts, so the yields should shift downward," Dash said.

Investors will also eye India's retail inflation data, which is due after market hours on Wednesday.

India's consumer inflation likely fell sharply to a five-month low of 4.60% in January from 5.22% in December on slowing food price rises, according to economists polled by Reuters.
