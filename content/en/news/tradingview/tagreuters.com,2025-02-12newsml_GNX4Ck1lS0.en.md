* Late-breaking oral presentation features echocardiographic data analysis showing favorable impact of AVIM therapy on MODERATO II study patients with diastolic dysfunction, a key component in the development of heart failure
* Hypertension is the leading cause of diastolic dysfunction; both conditions are common in older patients and contribute to the development of heart failure

NEW HOPE, Pa., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Orchestra BioMed Holdings, Inc. (“Orchestra BioMed” or the “Company”), a biomedical company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today announced a late-breaking oral presentation of data on the benefits of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy on patients with diastolic dysfunction at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics (“THT”) 2025 Conference in Boston, Massachusetts. The retrospective analysis of data from the MODERATO II study demonstrated that AVIM therapy significantly improved echocardiographic (“Echo”) markers of diastolic dysfunction, an important component in the development of heart failure, in hypertensive patients.

The presentation titled "Effects of Atrioventricular Interval Modulation (AVIM) Therapy in Subjects with Hypertension and Diastolic Dysfunction" is being delivered in a late-breaking clinical science session at THT by Marat Fudim, M.D., M.H.S.​ Advanced Heart Failure Cardiologist, Duke Health on Wednesday, February 12, 2025, at 10:43am ET.

Dr. Fudim commented, “For many patients with long-standing hypertension, the heart can undergo structural and functional changes that result in diastolic dysfunction, the progression of which is directly linked to the development of heart failure. By reducing systolic blood pressure and favorably impacting intra-cardiac pressures and volumes, AVIM therapy directly affects diastolic filling and myocardial relaxation. This analysis of MODERATO II data provides exciting insights that suggest that, beyond lowering systolic blood pressure, AVIM therapy improves diastolic function and leads to favorable ventricular remodeling. Given the strong link between uncontrolled hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure, these findings highlight the opportunity to intervene earlier and leverage AVIM therapy for the prevention of heart failure.”

**Key Findings:**

A retrospective, treatment-blinded analysis of MODERATO II assessed the impact of 6 months of AVIM therapy on systolic blood pressure (“SBP”) and Echo markers of diastolic dysfunction (“DD”) using core lab Echos with independent blinded adjudication. Patients were classified as with DD (“DD+”) or without DD (“DD-”) using ​the American Society of Echocardiography Guidelines. From the MODERATO II study cohort (n=47), 36 patients had technically sufficient Echo data, and 61% of this group (22/36) had Echo evidence of DD.

Using key measures of diastolic function, AVIM therapy:

* Significantly reduced office and ambulatory SBP in patients ​with DD through 6 months
  + Ambulatory SBP (“aSBP”) was reduced in AVIM-treated DD+ patients (N=12) by 8.3±9.7 mmHg (p<0.01 vs baseline) compared to 2.2±9.8 mmHg in the control DD+ group (N=10)
  + Office SBP (“oSBP”) was reduced in AVIM-treated DD+ patients by 12.1±12.8 mmHg (p<0.01 vs baseline) compared to an increase of 2.9±26.4 mmHg in the control DD+ group (N=10)
  + SBP reduction was similar in patients with and without DD
* Significantly improved key measures of diastolic dysfunction​
  + In patients with DD, AVIM therapy demonstrated favorable Echo changes consistent with improved myocardial relaxation and diastolic compliance. Specifically, in comparison to DD+ control patients, AVIM-treated DD+ patients experienced a significant increase in e’ (from 5.9±2.0 to 8.8±3.4cm/sec; P<0.01) consistent with an improvement in left ventricular relaxation and a significant increase in E/A (from 0.86±0.39 to 1.60±0.84; P<0.01) consistent with improved passive filling of the left ventricle despite reduced filling time (the designed effect of AVIM therapy) with no significant changes in left atrial size.

“The late-breaking data shared at THT present a broader view of the potential benefits of AVIM therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. These findings provide further evidence that AVIM therapy, in addition to significantly reducing systolic blood pressure, may also favorably influence ventricular function in important ways for patients with diastolic dysfunction and at risk for heart failure,” said Avi Fischer, M.D., Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs and Innovation at Orchestra BioMed. “This could provide a new paradigm for the treatment of hypertension and its many associated risks in pacemaker-indicated patients and other higher risk populations, offering the opportunity to potentially intervene earlier in disease progression. We are eager to continue exploring the clinical effects of AVIM therapy through the ongoing BACKBEAT global pivotal study in which we fully expect to see many hypertensive patients like these that are not adequately controlled with antihypertensive medication and also have diastolic dysfunction and increased risk for heart failure. We believe this robust, double-blind, randomized study will define AVIM therapy’s potential role in the management of uncontrolled high blood pressure and its broader cardiovascular effects.”

**About AVIM Therapy** 

AVIM therapy is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) global pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.
