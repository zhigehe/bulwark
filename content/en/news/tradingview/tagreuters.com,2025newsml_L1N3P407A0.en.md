Belgium's largest bank KBC beat expectations on Thursday with a fourth-quarter net profit of 1.17 billion euros ($1.22 billion), surpassing the 1.06 billion euros figure in a company provided poll.

"Compared to the result of the previous quarter, our total income benefited from several factors, including higher net interest income, increased insurance revenues and sharply higher net fee and commission income", said CEO Johan Thijs.

It reported net interest income (NII) of 1.43 billion euros, exceeding the same analyst consensus and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, with net fee and commission income rising 9% compared to the third quarter.

The lender expects total income to grow by at least 5.5% in 2025 compared with the previous year, while its NII should amount to no less than 5.7 billion euros and be supported by organic loan growth of around 4%.

KBC also sees its insurances revenues before reinsurance jumping 7% or more in the year. In 2024, it came at 2.95 billion euros, accounting for more than 26% of total income.

Its CET-1 ratio, calculating capital reserves required to withstand financial distress, stands at 15%, well above the legal threshold of 10.88%.
