Copper futures remained above $4.67 per pound on Tuesday, staying near multi-month highs as investors largely shrugged off the latest tariff measures from the US. President Donald Trump signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports "without exceptions or exemptions," raising concerns about a deepening global trade war.

Copper prices also received support from concerns about tightening supply in Chile, the worldâ€™s largest copper producer, with delays caused by repairs and aging mines.

Additionally, Chinese demand has rebounded following the Lunar New Year celebrations, while US demand appears stronger as buyers stock up in anticipation of potential tariffs targeting the industry.
