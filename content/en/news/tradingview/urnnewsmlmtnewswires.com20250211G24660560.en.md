Arizona Lithium entered into an agreement with Koch Technology Solutions, a subsidiary of Koch, to deploy a Li-Pro commercial-scale direct lithium extraction unit for first-phase production at its Prairie lithium project in Canada, according to an Australian bourse filing on Tuesday.

The first phase is a commercial scale proof-of-concept facility at its pad number one. Duperow brine from the pad was tested with the Li-Pro technology and resulted in around 98% lithium retention and an average 99% rejection of impurities such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.

The unit will process around 1,000 cubic meters of brine per day and produce lithium chloride, which will be further purified and concentrated onsite. It will then be converted into battery-grade lithium carbonate.

It also entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding for a commercial license to use the Li-Pro technology beyond the first phase.
