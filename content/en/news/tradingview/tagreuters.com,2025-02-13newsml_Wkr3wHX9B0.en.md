Lindab

Lindab has signed an agreement with Handelsbanken, Nordea, DNB Bank, and Danske Bank to link its existing credit facility to sustainability targets. The agreement is linked to three sustainability targets aiming to reduce emissions within scope 1 and 2, reduce emissions from purchased steel and sustain a safe work environment.

Sustainability is a high priority for Lindab, and the new agreement is designed to further strengthen this commitment by linking financing to specific and ambitious targets that are reviewed annually. This underlines Lindab’s dedication to integrating sustainability into all aspects of its operations, while also demonstrating a close connection between financial objectives and environmental and social ambitions.

“This agreement is a clear example of how we are taking further steps in our sustainability work. By linking our financing to ambitious and science-based targets, we demonstrate our serious commitment to the sustainable transition,” says Matilda Isaksson, Group Sustainability Manager at Lindab.

The agreement with Handelsbanken, Nordea, DNB Bank and Danske Bank covers existing credit agreements of SEK 4,050 million and EUR 120 million. The agreement runs until the second quarter of 2027 with an option for extension of one plus one year. The margin adjustment on the credit facility is based on how well Lindab performs in relation to the established targets. Handelsbanken acted as sustainability coordinator.

“Linking our credit facility to our sustainability targets is an important step in our continuous efforts to integrate our sustainability ambitions throughout our operations,” Lars Ynner, CFO at Lindab, concludes.

LINDAB’S CREDIT FACILITY IS SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED TO THE FOLLOWING TARGETS:

**Reduced emissions within scope 1 and 2**

A continuous reduction of the company’s direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions related to its own operations.

Reduced emissions from purchased steel (part of scope 3)

A reduction of emissions linked to purchased steel used in Lindab’s products.

**Safe work environment**

An improvement in workplace safety through a reduction in LTIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency).
