“Net sales increased during the fourth quarter by 41.5 percent to SEK 64.2 million, compared with the corresponding quarter of 2023. The growth and strong performance are a result of robust development in every geographical market and several large orders from Thermo Fisher.

The gross margin for the quarter amounted to 84.4 percent, up from 72.3 percent in Q3 2024. The same performance measure for the full-year 2024 amounted to 79.6 percent (85.5), a decrease linked to costs related to the validation of the new production facility, while the fourth quarter showed that we are once again above the target set of 80 percent.

The big financial news for the quarter is the positive operating result of SEK 0.7 million (-18.5), achieved through efficiency improvements implemented during the third quarter and a large inventory build-up order from Thermo Fisher.

Devyser is well-positioned for continued growth with a strong focus on profitability. Our tried and tested business model, built on providing high-quality IVD-approved tests to genetic testing laboratories and transplant centers, has proved capable of delivering good results and opportunities for further growth. By clarifying the strategy as one in which profitability is both a driving force and guides our decisions, in future we will focus on more clearly defined customer segments and work on refining the product portfolio to target specific product lines that have the highest potential.”

Fredrik Dahl, Interim CEO, Devyser

**Important events during the quarter**

*Devyser presented new innovations and research*

Devyser is continuing to invest in product development. At ASHI 2024, the foremost transplantation conference in the US, held at the end of October, six posters and one abstract were presented showcasing new, innovative Devyser products and the clinical results achieved from using them. These showed, among other things, the advantages offered by our products compared with the competition.

Devyser terminated its liquidity guarantee agreement

In October, Devyser announced that its liquidity guarantee agreement with Carnegie Investment Bank would end on November 29, 2024. Devyser believes that current trading of the share and its liquidity are at good levels and that there is therefore no real need for a liquidity guarantee.

*Expanded collaboration with Thermo Fisher*

In addition to the commercial terms of the collaboration agreement with Thermo Fisher, the companies have now also agreed on the plan to apply for FDA approval for Devyser’s product for the detection of cell-free DNA in the blood of kidney transplant patients. This addition to the agreement will significantly increase Devyser’s chances of obtaining FDA approval quickly and cost effectively, as it means gaining access to Thermo Fisher's regulatory resources. As an FDA-approved product does not yet exist, FDA approval could potentially completely transform kidney transplant monitoring in the US. It would give patients access to faster test results.

*Regulatory approval of Devyser Compact in China*

Devyser has reached a significant regulatory milestone with its first market registration with China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for Devyser Compact, an IVDR-certified genetic test for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses. Rapid prenatal detection is a Class III product in China. The regulatory approval enables Devyser to market Devyser Compact in China, and also lays the foundations for future regulatory approvals.

*Devyser obtained Class D IVDR approval for RHD*

In December, Devyser obtained IVDR approval for its product for the non-invasive screening of fetal RHD. This is the first approval of a Class D product; this is the highest risk class under the new, more comprehensive regulation, which entered into force in May 2022.

*The share and new share issues*

Three new share issues were carried out during the quarter in connection with the exercising of employee stock options. The issues raised SEK 3.9 million for the company.

**Important events after the end of the quarter**
