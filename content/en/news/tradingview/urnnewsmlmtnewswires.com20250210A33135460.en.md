Health care stocks were flat to edging higher pre-bell Monday as the iShares Biotechnology ETF was inactive and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.2% recently.

Pliant Therapeutics shares declined by nearly 61% after the company said it has suspended enrollment and treatment in a phase 2b trial of bexotegrast for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following a recommendation from the trial's data safety monitoring board.

Roivant Sciences shares were up nearly 6% even after the company reported lower fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue.

DocGo shares rose past 3% after the company said it has acquired PTI Health to add mobile phlebotomy lab services to its portfolio.
