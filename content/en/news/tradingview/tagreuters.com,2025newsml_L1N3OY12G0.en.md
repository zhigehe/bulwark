Chicago Board of Trade corn futures closed weaker on Friday as traders booked profits amid renewed concerns about potential U.S. trade disputes, analysts said.

* There was a risk-off mentality in grain markets ahead of the weekend, after corn futures reached a 15-month high on Wednesday, a broker said.
* U.S. President Donald Trump said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, raising concerns among traders about potential retaliation from importers that could dent U.S. crop sales.
* Improved rains in Argentina, the world's No. 3 corn exporter, added pressure to grain prices, traders said.
* The U.S. Department of Agriculture is slated to update monthly global supply and demand estimates on Tuesday.
* CBOT March corn (CH25) ended down 7-3/4 cents at $4.87-1/2 a bushel.
