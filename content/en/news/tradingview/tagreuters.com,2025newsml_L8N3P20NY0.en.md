Shares in tank gearbox manufacturer Renk gained 10% to jump to the top of the German small-cap index after defence equipment maker KNDS said on Tuesday it had increased its stake in the firm.

KNDS, whose Leopard 2 tanks use transmissions made at Renk, said its stake went from 6.7% to 25.1%, and that it has strong confidence in the Augsburg-based firm and its management.

No financial details of the transaction were disclosed, but based on Renk's Monday closing share price of 22.45 euros, KNDS' acquisition of 18.3 million shares has a value of 411 million euros ($424 million).

"We are reaffirming our commitment to a long-term cooperation, with an independent and highly reliable partner," said KNDS CEO Philippe Balducchi.

KNDS is Renk's second-biggest shareholder, LSEG data show.

Renk, which listed in Frankfurt in February 2024 following a change in the European stance towards defence, posted full-year order intake of 1.4 billion euros and revenue for 1.1 billion euros at the end of January.

KNDS was an anchor investor in Renk's IPO with a 6.7% stake, and had already secured an option to increase its stake to 25%.

Neither side has commented on the purchase price for that package, but according to the agreement, it is above the IPO price of 15 euros a share.

Renk recently saw a change in management, as its CEO Susanne Wiegand stepped down due to personal reasons and was succeeded by the former chief operating officer Alexander Sagel.

The stock is on track for its best day since March 2024.
