Aterian subsidiary Eastinco resumed its mineral trading operations in Rwanda after implementing the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum, and Gas Board's Inkomane trading system.

The metal-focused exploration and development company said Monday that Eastinco previously suspended operations due to difficulties in complying with the system's initial rollout as well as muted market activity.

Aterian added it is in final talks with an undisclosed international trading house to secure a new trade finance facility and logistical support for the project.
