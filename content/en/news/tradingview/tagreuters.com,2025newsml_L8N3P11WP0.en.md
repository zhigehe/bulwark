UniCredit on Tuesday said it would keep its profit stable this year despite lower rates after posting a better than expected 2024 result, and pledged to increase shareholder rewards in 2025-2027.

Profit in the October-December period totalled 1.97 billion euros ($2.03 billion), above a 1.63-billion-euro company-gathered consensus forecast.

That compared with 2.8 billion euros a year ago, when the boost from tax credits linked to past losses was more than twice as big.

Under the leadership of CEO Andrea Orcel, an M&A veteran, UniCredit has embarked on an aggressive expansion strategy, building a 28% stake in Germany's Commerbank and launching an all-share bid for smaller domestic peer Banco BPM .

It has also taken a 4.1% stake in insurer Generali as an investment which also gives it influence in other takeover and boardroom battles unfolding in Italian finance.

($1 = 0.9700 euros)
