Shares of Fidelity National Information Services plunged intraday Tuesday after the financial technology company's top-line performance for the fourth quarter and its top-line outlook for the full year disappointed Wall Street's expectations.

Revenue rose to $2.6 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31 from $2.51 billion a year ago, but was below the $2.63 billion average analyst estimate in a FactSet survey. Adjusted earnings per share advanced to $1.40 from $0.94 and beat the Street's $1.36 view.

Shares of Fidelity National Information tumbled 18% in Tuesday trade.

In the company's banking solutions segment, revenue ticked up 1% to $1.72 billion, shy of analysts' $1.77 billion forecast. Capital market solutions revenue jumped 9% to $821 million, 2.2% above market views.

For 2025, Fidelity National Information is expecting revenue to grow 4.6% to 5.2% year over year to between $10.44 billion and $10.5 billion. The outlook marks an acceleration from a 3% increase achieved for 2024, but is below the $10.6 billion FactSet consensus. Adjusted EPS is seen advancing 9% to 11%, reaching between $5.70 and $5.80, compared with a 56% improvement achieved for 2024. The market is modeling for $5.72.

"Our 2025 outlook reflects acceleration in the business as we look to further build on the foundations laid in 2024 and drive double-digit total returns," Chief Executive Stephanie Ferris said in a statement.

Management guided first-quarter revenue of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, underwhelming the Street's $2.57 billion projection. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range between $1.17 and $1.22, below the $1.29 consensus.

Separately on Tuesday, Fidelity National Information said it partnered with Affirm (AFRM) to bring the buy-now, pay-later service provider's solutions to Fidelity's debit processing bank clients.

"For the first time, we're bringing Affirm's proprietary underwriting technology and full suite of pay-over-time solutions to third party issuers in partnership with FIS," Affirm Chief Revenue Officer Wayne Pommen said in a statement.
