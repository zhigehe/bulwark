Brent crude oil futures held near $76 per barrel on Tuesday, maintaining a 1.6% gain from the previous session, driven by signs of tighter Russian supply and mounting supply risks.

Reports indicated Russian production fell further below its OPEC+ quota in January, while new US sanctions targeted individuals and tankers involved in transporting Iranian crude to China, aiming to pressure Tehran.

Adding to supply risks, Trump urged Israel to end its ceasefire with Hamas if hostages aren’t returned this weekend, raising the threat of renewed conflict as both sides accuse each other of violating the deal.

However, gains remained capped by caution over rising trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty.

Trump’s recent tariffs on steel and aluminum could disrupt the US energy sector, particularly oil drillers reliant on specialty steel unavailable domestically.

Meanwhile, soaring natural gas prices in Europe have made burning oil more cost-effective, potentially boosting demand.
