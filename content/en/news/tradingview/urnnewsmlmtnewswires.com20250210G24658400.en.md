Shuaa Capital (DFM:SHUAA) said Monday it secured 150 million Emirati dirhams for one of two planned mandatory convertible bond issues.

The binding commitments under the private placement were from Eshraq Investment, Al Baher Real Estate Development and United Motors & Heavy Equipment.

The Dubai-based asset management and investment banking platform operator said in December 2024 that the second tranche is expected to raise 275.5 million dirhams.
