Momentus shares were up 42%, to $5.40, after the company said it was awarded a $3.5 million contract expansion by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to conduct an in-orbit demonstration of the assembly of large-scale structures.

The San Jose, Calif., commercial space company said the mission will launch on an upcoming SpaceX Transporter rideshare as soon as early 2026.

Momentus said it is under contract to provide full-service support to the DARPA Novel Orbital and Moon Manufacturing, Materials, and Mass-efficient Design program, including arrangement of launch services, payload integration, and in-orbit hosting of the payload for a complex in-space assembly mission.

The in-space assembly will be conducted on the Momentus Vigoride Orbital Service Vehicle, said the company. The purpose of this effort is to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the in-space assembly payload in the low-Earth-orbit space environment, Momentus said.
