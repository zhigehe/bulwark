China's 10-year government bond yield rose to around 1.65%, hitting its highest level in three weeks, as investors digested the People's Bank of China's latest policy signals.

The central bank pledged to adjust monetary policy when appropriate to support economic growth, emphasizing liquidity management and targeted measures to stabilize the financial system.

Despite this, bond yields climbed as market participants assessed the potential impact of these policy moves.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump delayed the implementation of reciprocal tariffs, easing concerns about escalating trade tensions, while the US continues to investigate unfair trade practices, with China among its key targets.

In response, Chinese producers are diversifying away from the U.S. market, focusing on Europe and emerging markets, which could lead to price wars abroad and economic challenges at home.
