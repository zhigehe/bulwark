The UK government instructed Apple to develop a backdoor entry for its user data, Bloomberg News reported Feb. 8, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The order was given under its Investigatory Powers Act, in which the government gives out a "technical capability notice" to tech companies for the removal of end-to-end encryptions. The UK government said the data would be used to investigate crimes.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.
