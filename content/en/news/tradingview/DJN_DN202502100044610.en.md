Porsche's 2025 outlook disappointed, with the carmaker guiding for 10%-12% return on sales, a sharp 350 basis point shortfall to consensus, Citi analysts Harald C Hendrikse and Soumava Banerjee write. The estimate would also be equivalent to an EBIT 1.5 billion euros lower than consensus expectations, they say. "While Porsche highlights 800 million euros of additional costs, this doesn't fully account for the shortfall, suggesting execution gaps." Porsche is a luxury brand and is not generating profitability in line with that, Citi says, adding that it is hard to see why investors would assume Porsche profitability can get close to the 17%-19% range set at the IPO. Citi rates Porsche stock at buy with a 82 euro target price. Shares trade 1.1% higher at 56.16 euros. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
