West African crude differentials were steady on Tuesday, with the focus on weaker demand after a recent jump prompted by the latest U.S. sanctions on Russia.

\* On Angolan crudes, medium-heavy grades that can replace sanctioned Russian and Iranian crude in Asia have found support, though the impact of this may be waning, traders said.

\* Nigerian Bonny Light crude was last heard to be on offer at, or close to, dated Brent plus $1.90, in line with where offers were heard at the end of last week.

\* Angola's April loading prgramme is expected to be issued in about a week. The pace of trade for the March loading schedule has been helped by demand from Indian and Chinese buyers.
