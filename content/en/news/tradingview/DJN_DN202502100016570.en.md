Parkway Life REIT is likely on a solid growth trajectory, DBS Group Research analysts say in a research report, as they maintain its buy rating on the REIT. The full earnings impact of the REIT's recent acquisition of a portfolio of French nursing homes is expected to emerge this year, the analysts say. Also, the rental upside for the REIT's Singapore hospitals should kick in from 2026, thanks to their master-lease renewal. Moreover, there's potential further upside to its Mount Elizabeth Orchard hospital's revenues post-asset enhancement initiative in 2026. However, DBS trims the unit's target price to S$4.75 from S$4.80 to reflect some adjusted assumptions. Units are 1.0% lower at S$3.94. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
