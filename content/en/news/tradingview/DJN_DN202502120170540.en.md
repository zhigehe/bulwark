The Trump administration's tariffs could weaken the Korean won against the U.S. dollar in the near term, with USD/KRW likely to stay at around 1,470.00 on a three-month horizon, Citigroup analysts Jin-Wook Kim and Jiuk Choi write in a note. The pair is flat at 1,453.45 early Thursday in Seoul onshore trading. The Citi analysts expect the won to be pressured by escalating risk-off sentiment, weakening export growth and rising USD demand for Korean companies to build supply chains in the U.S. Citi expects the Bank of Korea to cut the policy rate in February unless the pair surges above the 1,500.00 level.
