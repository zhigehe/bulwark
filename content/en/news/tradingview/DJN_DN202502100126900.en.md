President Trump's trade, fiscal and immigration policy agenda is expected to be mildly inflationary, BofA analysts write, forecasting the changes to be reflected in inflation by 2H 2025. Any additional tariffs in the next few weeks could advance the timeline, they note. "A key question is whether policy changes impact long-run inflation expectations," they say, adding that market-based measures remain within the historical range. BofA reiterates its stance that the Fed's cutting cycle is over, with inflation "stuck above target," forecasting both headline and core CPI to have increased by 0.3% on month in January. "If our January CPI forecast is correct, the case for the Fed to stay on hold will strengthen further," they write. U.S. CPI data is due Wednesday. (jihye.lee@wsj.com)
