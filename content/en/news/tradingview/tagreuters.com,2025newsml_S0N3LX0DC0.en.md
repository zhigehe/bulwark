Basic controls are needed at the U.S. Treasury, Elon Musk said on Tuesday, after a U.S. district judge on Saturday blocked Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury's payment systems.

Musk, speaking alongside President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, told reporters that members of the federal bureaucracy were getting wealthier at taxpayers' expense, and the public's elected representatives should decide on agency actions rather than the large unelected bureaucracy.
