Investors Gear Up for Powell Testimony, Inflation Data This Week By Vicky Ge Huang

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill this week for two days of testimony, a couple of weeks after the central bank hit pause on interest rates. In between his appearances, the latest U.S. consumer-inflation report is due-always crucial data for the central bank.

Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, in his first Congressional appearance since President Trump's inauguration. Questions are likely to cover the new administration's tariff policies and the outlook for interest rates and inflation.

The big number of the week arrives on Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET with the January reading of the consumer-price index. Surveyed economists expect the CPI to increase 2.8% from a year earlier, slightly lower than the 2.9% rate as of December.

January's producer-price index follows Wednesday's CPI reading at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. Economists expect a monthly gain of 0.3% in the PPI, slightly ahead of the 0.2% print for December.

A flurry of economic indicators round out the week, including retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET. Readings on industrial production, capacity utilization and business inventories follow.

Top News Solid January Jobs Report Plays Into the Fed's Pause

After a solid January jobs report, more traders are betting that the Fed's rate-cut pause might last longer than expected .

When the Federal Reserve reached for a half-point interest-rate cut in September, two concerns fueled the urgency.

Inflation had already fallen most of the way back to the central bank's 2% target, but at an upper bound of 5.5%, the Fed's benchmark interest rate looked like it was still firmly restraining the economy. Meanwhile, a set of weaker monthly job reports over the summer of 2024 prompted anxiety that the labor market could start weakening in a hurry.

Now-after three straight rate cuts last year, and especially after Friday's solid jobs update-neither of those factors looks true any longer. That could set up the Fed to extend its January rate-cut pause through much of 2025, with rates holding at or perhaps just below the current 4.25% to 4.5% target.

January Jobs Report Keeps Fed in Wait-and-See Mode ECB Updates Estimate of Neutral Rate

U.S. Economy The Mood of the American Consumer is Souring

Tariff threats, stock market swings and rapidly reversing executive orders are causing Americans across the political spectrum to feel considerably more pessimistic about the economy than they did before President Trump took office.

U.S. Added 143,000 Jobs in January; Unemployment Slipped to 4%

The U.S. economy added 143,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate edged down to 4%, the Labor Department said Friday. The numbers show a job market that is cooling but still solid.

Trump's Next Round of Tariffs Won't Be So Easily Averted

A Sore Spot in L.A.'s Housing Crisis: Empty Foreign-Owned Homes

Financial Regulation Carried Interest Tax Rate Comes Under Fire, Again, from Trump

The U.S. IPO Market Needs Saving. Could Paul Atkins Be the Answer?

Research BLS Says California Fires, Winter Weather Likely Didn't Affect Payrolls

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that California wildfires and severe winter weather in much of the U.S. "had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings" in January payrolls. The report showed a larger-than-expected drop in job creation last month, to 143,000, less than half as much as in December. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% in the month, compared with a 0.3% pace in December. - Paulo Trevisani

India's Central Bank Likely to Cut Again in April

India's central bank will likely cut rates by 25 bps in April, SMBC economist Ryota Abe says in a note. Estimates point to a continued economic slowdown, and the government and the Reserve Bank of India will likely work together to support the economy with complementary policies, Abe says. The RBI's recent manufacturing sentiment survey showed that 25% of companies surveyed reported shrinking net profit margins for the October-December quarter, up from 19% a year ago. That suggests a persistent manufacturing slowdown and likely contributed to the RBI's lowered GDP growth forecast for this fiscal year, the economist adds. In addition, as inflation stabilizes, real rates will remain high, leaving more room for lowering the nominal policy rate, Abe says. - Kimberley Kao

Basis Points Canadian employers continued to aggressively add to their ranks as the year began, pushing the jobless rate down for a second month running in January and adding to signs the economy is on firmer ground. Europe gets a turn in President Trump's firing line this week. Senior administration officials are heading across the Atlantic to tackle points of tension including tech regulation, trade, military spending and Russia's war in Ukraine. European natural-gas prices jumped in early trade , reaching a two-year high as stronger fuel demand due to colder temperatures risks draining already low inventories. France is making a bid to catch up in the artificial intelligence race by leaning on one of its strengths : plentiful nuclear power. Asian equity markets were mixed while most base metal prices rose as investors and traders weighed U.S. President Trump's pledge to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. China's consumer inflation accelerated in January as food and service prices climbed ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, official data showed Sunday. Chinese officials are building a list of U.S. tech companies that can be targeted with antitrust probes and other tools, hoping to influence the tech executives who are heavily represented in President Trump's orbit.
