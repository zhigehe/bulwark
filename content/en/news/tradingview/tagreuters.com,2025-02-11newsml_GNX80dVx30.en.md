ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Euroseas Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESEA, the “Company” or “Euroseas”), an owner and operator of container carrier vessels and provider of seaborne transportation for containerized cargoes, announced today a new time charter contract for its 1,740 teu feeder containership, M/V EM Hydra for a minimum period of 24 to a maximum period of 26 months, at the option of the charterer, at a gross daily rate of $19,000, in direct continuation of its current charter. The new charter period is expected to commence on May 1, 2025.

Aristides Pittas, Chairman and CEO of Euroseas commented: “We are very pleased to announce that we have extended the time charter contract for our 20-year-old M/V EM Hydra with a top-tier charterer, in direct continuation of its present charter, for 24-26 months at a profitable rate of $19,000. Despite the potential reopening of the Red Sea routes which could normalize trading routes, the charter market for feeder containerships remains quite resilient, with limited vessel availability continuing to support strong periods and rates. This charter is expected to contribute about $7.3 million of EBITDA over the minimum contracted period and increase our 2025 charter coverage to about 85%, and our charter coverage for 2026 to about 50%.”

After the charter of M/V EM Hydra, and after the previously announced spin-off of three of the Company’s subsidiaries into a separate company, Euroholdings Ltd., which has applied for listing on the NASDAQ exchange, the Euroseas Ltd. fleet profile is as follows:
