The events of the past two weeks indicate an extended period of uncertainty around trade policy that will likely command much attention from investors, says Lazard's chief market strategist Ronald Temple. "What is clear is that U.S. inflation will likely be boosted slightly by the tariffs imposed so far, while U.S. GDP might be slightly reduced," he says in a note. A 10% tariff on all Chinese goods is also unlikely to be the end of the story, he says, expecting a broader, larger set of tariffs that will likely have a material effect on growth and inflation. The situation remains very fluid, which makes estimating the impact of the new tariffs against China difficult, he adds. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)
