(The Insurer) - Hannover Re’s long-serving Yury Braun has left the reinsurer and launched a new US-focused reinsurance MGU.

You Re – named in reference to the founder’s first name – will write a portfolio of casualty, non-catastrophe property, professional liability and cyber business.

The company said it is “partnering exclusively” with AM Best-rated reinsurers. In doing so, You Re said its clients will receive full reinsurance credit without having to deal with the complexities associated with collateral management.

“The reinsurance industry is evolving, with increasing demand for greater transparency, smarter risk selection and more efficient capital deployment,” said Braun, You Re’s founder and CEO.

“By combining advanced technology with deep underwriting expertise, we are strengthening risk selection and portfolio management for our capacity partners while delivering tailored solutions to underserved market segments.

“The strong market traction we are already seeing highlights the need for a more specialised and responsive approach to reinsurance,” Braun added.

In its launch announcement, You Re said it combines industry expertise with advanced technology to provide capacity for underserved market segments. It will also provide risk assessment and portfolio management for its capacity partners.

Before launching the start-up, Braun spent the past 14 years at Hannover Re. Based in the German reinsurer’s home city, Braun most recently served Hannover Re as vice president for underwriting, North American specialty, leading a team of 11 underwriters and developing the reinsurer's insurtech and agency portfolio in the US.
