Ashtead Group plans to proceed with a switch of its main listing to the U.S. as flagged in December, marking a further blow to the London bourse.

The FTSE 100-listed equipment rental company said Tuesday that it has discussed the rationale of a move with a wide variety of shareholders who are supportive of the plan.

As part of the move, Ashtead will create a new U.S. company to be named Sunbelt Rentals Holdings, for which current shareholders will hold shares.

Ashtead plans to hold a general meeting in June and if approved it expects the change to become effective in the first quarter of next year.

North America is its core growth market, which represented 98% of its operating profit for fiscal 2024, and its operational headquarters and management team are located in the U.S.

The proposed move makes Ashtead the latest company to shun the London Stock Exchange for a U.S. listing. Flutter Entertainment--which houses FanDuel, PokerStars, and Paddy Power among its brands--made New York its prime listing from May 31,Â 2024, while British chip maker Arm Holdings chose New York over London for its stock market return in September 2023.

German travel company TUI quit London in June and drugmaker Indivior switched its main listing to the U.S a month earlier, while retaining a secondary listing in the U.K. Just Eat Takeaway.com also left the London Exchange last year.

Shares were up 62.0 pence, or 1.2%, at 51.36 pounds in late morning European trading. They are currently up 3.4% over the past month but 18% lower over the past three months.
