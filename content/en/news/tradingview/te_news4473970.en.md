The Hong Kong stock market fell by 92 points or 0.4% to 21,434 during Tuesday morning trading, marking its first decline in four sessions.

The drop reflected cautious sentiment following President Trump's announcement of a global 25% tariff on US imports of steel and aluminum, set to take effect on March 4.

Markets retreated from their highest level in since early October, as traders adopted vigilant stance ahead of this week’s key US inflation data and Fed Chair Powell’s testimony before Congress.
