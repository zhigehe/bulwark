The operator of the Brazilian stock market B3 will soon start offering derivatives and stocks from Brazil internationally, the company's chief executive said on Friday.

Talks are being held with global digital investment platforms, and the start of operations is expected within two to three months, B3 CEO Gilson Finkelsztain told journalists during an event in Sao Paulo.

One of the platforms that may offer Brazilian products is Interactive Brokers , Finkelsztain said.

The executive also said it is difficult to predict if Brazil will have initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025.

However, he believes the IPO market in Brazil will be reopened by mature companies from traditional sectors and capable of offering liquidity to investors.

The Brazilian stock exchange has not seen an IPO in over three years.
