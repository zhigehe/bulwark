Commerzbank's midterm plan to 2028 is bullish and the relatively linear progress on its targets is a positive, Deutsche Bank says in a research note after the German lender's update. "While the afternoon session will help to judge the credibility of the bullish new targets, we are particularly encouraged by the positive 2025 guidance, high near-term capital return (12.5% yield for 2025), and a new restructuring program with 500 million euros of savings," analysts Benjamin Goy and Marlene Eibensteiner write.
