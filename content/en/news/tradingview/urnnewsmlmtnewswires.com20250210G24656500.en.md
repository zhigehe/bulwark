Perhaps presenting a challenge to the nation's central bank, Japan's service-sector worker outlooks declined modestly in January, reported the Cabinet Office.

The Japan Economy Watchers Survey for current conditions, a polling of the nation's cab drivers, hotel clerks, barkeeps and other front-line service workers, declined to 48.6 in January from 49.0 in December, reported the Cabinet Office on Monday.

A reading of 50 on the monthly survey is considered neutral, meaning service workers are neither optimistic nor pessimistic, while above 50 signals confidence, and below pessimism.

The Economy Watchers Survey index for future conditions fell to 48.0 in January from 49.4 in December, added the Cabinet Office.

The Bank of Japan in recent months has reiterated it wants higher wages in Japan, to spur consumer spending, and thus to promote an overall economic expansion.

However, the Economy Watchers Survey in January suggests a mildly downbeat employee base in the service sector, one that might not want to boost spending.

The Bank of Japan has forecast that the nation's gross domestic product will expand by 1% in fiscal 2025, starting on April 1, after growing by a slim 0.5% in fiscal 2024.
