U.S. crude oil inventories likely increased for a third consecutive week along with further accumulation of gasoline stocks, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal.

Commercial crude stocks are seen rising by 2.4 million barrels to 426.2 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 7, according to the average estimate of eight analysts and traders. Expectations range from a build of 1.1 million barrels to a build of 3.7 million barrels.

Gasoline inventories are expected to be up by 800,000 barrels at 251.9 million barrels, according to the survey, with estimates ranging from an increase of 2.6 million barrels to a withdrawal of 2.7 million barrels. It would make a 13th straight weekly build in gasoline stocks.

A decline of 1.6 million barrels is forecast for distillate fuels to 116.9 million barrels, with estimates ranging from a build of 2 million barrels to a draw of 3.7 million barrels.

Refinery capacity use likely edged up by a fifth of a percentage point to 84.7%. Forecasts range from an increase of 1 percentage point to a decrease of 0.8 of a percentage point.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release weekly inventory data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST.
