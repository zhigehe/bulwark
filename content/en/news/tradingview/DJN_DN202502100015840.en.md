The impact of China's recently added 10% tariffs on auto imports from the U.S. is expected to be limited, Nomura analysts write in a note. China is set to impose an additional 10% tariff on imports of large vehicles and pickup trucks assembled in the U.S., bringing the total import duty to 25%, the analysts add. This move is part of a set of measures announced by Beijing on February 4 in retaliation against Trump's 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods imported to the U.S. However, given the decline in new vehicle imports to China following the pandemic, Nomura believes the impact on global automakers will be minimal. Last year, 50% of China's auto imports came from Europe and the U.K., the analysts note. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy\_jiahuihuang)
