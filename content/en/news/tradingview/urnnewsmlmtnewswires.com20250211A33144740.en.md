IN8bio said Tuesday that new data from the ongoing early-stage study of INB-100 showed that 100% of acute myeloid leukemia patients in the original and expansion groups through Jan. 17 remained in complete remission.

The company said INB-100, which is designed to help patients with complex leukemias, such as AML, also showed improved survival compared with standard treatment.

The investigational therapy also "appears to be well-tolerated" and has no significant effect on patient quality of life, the company said.

Shares of IN8bio were up 71% in recent premarket activity on Tuesday.
