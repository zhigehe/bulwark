The yield on France’s 10-year OAT retreated to 3.15% as investor sentiment improved following reports that the Trump administration aims to initiate peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, raising hopes for an end to the Ukraine war.

US President Donald Trump stated late Wednesday that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed a willingness to negotiate in separate phone calls with him.

Meanwhile, stronger-than-expected US inflation data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated for longer.

In Europe, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain its dovish stance as it balances sluggish economic growth with inflation remaining within projected levels.
