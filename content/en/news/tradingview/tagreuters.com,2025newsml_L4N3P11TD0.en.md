Southwest Airlines said on Monday it had named Tom Doxey as its chief financial officer.

The Dallas-based carrier added that the appointment would take effect from March 10.

Doxey, an industry veteran, began his career in financial planning and fleet management roles at Allegiant Air and US Airways, but most recently served as the president of Breeze Airways.

In January, Southwest announced that its current CFO, Tammy Romo, would retire after a career spanning over three decades at the airline.
