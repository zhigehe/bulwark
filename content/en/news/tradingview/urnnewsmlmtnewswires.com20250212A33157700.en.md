The Toronto Stock Exchange, which was down 120 points at the open, has recovered some ground and is 30 points lower at midday with most sectors down.

Energy down 1%, is the biggest decliner. Miners and telecoms, up 1% and 0.6%, respectively, are the biggest gainers.

Oil prices weakened following three days of gains as a report showed an outsized rise in U.S. oil inventories last week. Gold prices continued to retreat from Monday's record high early on Wednesday as the dollar and treasury yields surged after U.S. inflation advanced at a faster-than-expected pace last month.

Natural gas was steady at a two-week high, supported by cold temperatures in big eastern markets that are keeping heating demand high.

In terms of U.S. data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5% month-on-month in January, an acceleration from December's 0.4% m/m gain. On a 12-month basis, CPI was up 3.0% (from 2.9% in December). Excluding food and energy, core inflation rose 0.4% m/m, ahead of the consensus and the strongest monthly gain since March 2024. The 12-month ticked up to 3.3% (from 3.2% in December), while the three-month annualized rose to a nine-month high of 3.8%.

TD Economics in citing the key implications said this report is "probably the last thing" the Federal Reserve and new Trump Administration wanted to see.

TD added: "The first CPI reading for 2025 showed core inflation rising at its fastest pace in nearly a year, amid a further uptick in goods prices and ongoing stickiness in services inflation. In the best of case, it's chalked up to residual seasonality (i.e., the inability of seasonal adjustment factors to capture regular calendar moves) and some reversal shows up in the coming months. This effect was apparent in the January/February readings in each of the last two-years."

Following this morning's release, TD noted, futures markets sold-off sharply while the 2-year Treasury yield was jolted higher by approximately 8 basis points to 4.37%. Fed futures pushed out the timing of a next rate cut to December.

This comes within a day of veteran market watcher David Rosenberg saying the tone from Fed Chair Jay Powell in prepared comments for his semi-annual Congressional testimony yesterday "lined up on the dovish side overall." Rosenberg noted there was "nothing in there about the remote possibility of having to raise rates," a prospect that has been bandied about in some corners of Wall Street. All of this at a time when the Bank of Canada is definitely on the rates lower path.

For its part, BMO Economics said the bottom line is there was "not much to like' in today's January CPI report. It added: "The moderation we saw in consumer inflation last summer is no longer visible now. The problem for the Fed is this isn't just a one-month event, but looks like a real multi-month firming of inflation pressures. It will make the FOMC, which is already cautious and patient regarding future rate cuts, even more so. This is especially true as we wait new announcements on sizable import tariffs. The risk of Fed rate hikes, while still low, is going up."
