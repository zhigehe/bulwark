TD Securities raised its price target on IGM Financial Inc. to $56 from $51 on Monday.

Analyst Graham Ryding maintained a Buy rating on shares of the Canadian asset management company following its quarterly results.

"Q4/24 results were largely in line with expectations, but we see some encouraging momentum and fundamentals," Ryding said in a note to clients. "IG Wealth is flowing positively again, demonstrating traction with sales to higher net worth households, and mortgage/insurance sales."

"While Mackenzie retail flows remain negative, they are making progress with retail wealth partners, and notably won $4 Billion of institutional mandates that are expected to fund in Q1/25," the analyst said.

"Strategic assets continue to show strong AUMA growth (albeit earnings growth is less compelling)."
