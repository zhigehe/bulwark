By Chris Wack

McEwen Mining shares were down 15% at $7.37 after the company priced $95 million of convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private placement.

The mining company also granted to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy, for settlement within 13 days from the date of initial issuance of the notes, up to an additional $15 million of notes.

The sale of the notes, which was upsized from $85 million, is scheduled to close Tuesday, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The initial conversion price of $11.25 per share represents a conversion premium of 30% over the closing sale price of $8.65 a share Thursday. McEwen said the offering provides strategic benefits to the company, including re-financing $20 million of higher-interest debt and a coupon rate of 5.25%

The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations, and will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on Feb. 15 and Aug. 15 of each year, beginning Aug. 15, 2025, at a rate of 5.25% per year. The notes will mature Aug. 15, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.
