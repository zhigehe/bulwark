China announced electricity pricing reforms, allowing market forces to determine on-grid prices for new energy sources, Xinhua News Agency reported.

According to the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration, electricity from wind and solar power will now be integrated into the market.

The previous fixed pricing system "could not fully reflect market supply and demand, nor adequately share the responsibility of power system regulation," the report cited both agencies.

Industry experts see this reform as a key step in Chinaâ€™s transition to a new phase of renewable energy development.
