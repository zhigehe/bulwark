Shares of Semtech fell after the chipmaker warned about missing its sales outlook for fiscal 2026 due to rack-architecture changes.

The stock was down 24%, to $41.46, in post-market trading Friday. Through the close, shares have surged 160% over the past 12 months.

The Camarillo, Calif., company said that sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are now expected to be lower than the $50 million previously anticipated.

The company doesn't expect ramp-up over the course of fiscal 2026, it added.
