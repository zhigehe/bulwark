WASHINGTON, DC / ACCESS Newswire / February 10,Â 2025 / EarthShare launches fiscal sponsorship services to strengthen the environmental movement by fostering collaboration among diverse communities, sectors, and regions, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and resources for environmental projects across the United States.

**What Is Fiscal Sponsorship?**

Fiscal sponsorship is when a nonprofit provides a mission-aligned group or project access to their legal and tax-exempt nonprofit status, allowing the project to skip the labor-intensive and costly steps of having to create and maintain a 501(c)(3) status of their own. A fiscal sponsor can also provide administrative support through financial management, human resources, and legal assistance.

**Why EarthShare?**

For the past 35 years, EarthShare has worked with individuals and businesses to amplify giving for our network of more than 500 environmental nonprofits. As a result, we've mobilized more than $400 million in support for our planet. Backed by a network of some of the best environmental nonprofits, our issue expertise and partner network exceed anything on the market, and it's continuously expanding. We are building the world's most robust and inclusive environmental network, with the goal to ensure that lesser-known, grassroots, frontline, and BIPOC-led nonprofits see increased visibility and financial support.

Today, EarthShare is using our years of environmental sector expertise to bring new programmatic work to life. We provide fiscal sponsorship and financial services for environmental projects looking to positively impact both people and the planet.

We're seeking projects that increase Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in environmental spaces, improving communities through the strategic involvement of those most impacted by environmental degradation. All projects should have a clear understanding of the connection between social and environmental issues.

**Is EarthShare the Right Fit?**

To learn more about what we're looking for, potential or existing projects can visit our website or contact Celange Beck, Director of Partnerships, to discuss the project's possible home at EarthShare.
