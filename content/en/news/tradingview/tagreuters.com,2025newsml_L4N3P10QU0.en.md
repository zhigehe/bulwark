Nordic forward power prices rose Monday, supported by a combination of higher energy rates for related markets, dwindling water reserves, and a cold, dry weather forecast over the next two weeks for the hydropower-reliant region.

\* By 1058 GMT, the Nordic front-quarter baseload power contract (ENOFBLQc1) was up 1.72 euros to 26.5 euros per megawatt hour (MWh).

\* Nordic front-year prices (ENOFBLYc1) gained 0.7 euros to 37.55 euros per MWh.

\* "Very dry and cold weather [over] the next two weeks and in addition ... the surrounding markets going up," are propelling the contracts to rise today, said Ole Tom Djupskaas, a power analyst at LSEG.

\* Dutch and British wholesale gas prices rose to around two-year highs on Monday morning as colder weather increased demand for gas and storage withdrawals rose.

\* In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract (CFI2Zc1) rose 1.31 euros to 83.59 euros a tonne.

\* German year-ahead power (TRDEBYc1) gained 2.15 euros to 102.4 per MWh.

\* While not a major contributing factor today, the slight "worsening of the hydrobalance" is adding to the uptick in prices, Djupskaas added.

\* Nordic water reserves available 15 days ahead (PCAEC00) were seen at 8.52 terawatt hours (TWh) above normal, compared with 10.19 TWh on Friday.

\* "The next 10 days will ... be colder and drier than normal with some sunny intervals and no significant snow. Temperatures will be below normal with low to moderate wind speeds," Georg Muller, a meteorologist at LSEG, said in a note.

\* "The final week of February will likely bring slowly milder weather and some light precipitation to the west and south," Muller added.

\* The Nordic power price for next-day physical delivery (FXSYSAL=NPX), or system price, rose 4.68 euros to 52.11 euros per MWh.
