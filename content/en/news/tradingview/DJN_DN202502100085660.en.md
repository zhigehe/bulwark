Shares of Blaize Holdings slipped after the artificial-intelligence company said its expenses could exceed its sales for the next two years.

The stock was down 16%, to $3.92, in midday trading Monday and has fallen 69% in the last month. The shares had their debut on the public market on Jan. 14 following the merger of Blaize and BurTech Acquisition Corp.

In the same frame, it forecast research and development expenses between $49 million and $52 million, as well as sales, general and administrative costs of $32 million to $34 million.

The El Dorado Hills, Calif., company said sales would increase to between $105 million and $140 million in its fiscal 2026, as solutions start to get deployed. For fiscal 2026, the company guided for research and development costs of $85 million and $89 million, as well as sales, general and administrative costs are expected between $35 million and $37 million.
