The latest Market Talks covering Financial Services. Exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.

2235 GMT [Dow Jones]--Questions around Newell Brands' ability to achieve its topline guidance will persist after the consumer-goods company missed fourth-quarter core sales, Citi analysts say in a research note. The Atlanta-based company's categories have remained soft with limited evidence that trends will improve, the analysts say. "While trade discussions are fluid and Newell Brands has mitigation strategies and delivered strong cost savings, we believe risk is skewed to the downside," the analysts add. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com)

2118 GMT - Canada Goose should change the format of its stores to better feature its star products after missing third-quarter sales expectations, TD Cowen analysts say in a research note. The Canadian winter apparel brand may also need to curate its stock keeping unit count to sell more with less and drive greater "storytelling," which leads to pricing leverage and credibility, the analysts say. Canada Goose is likely sequencing change, with product being central and primary, and overall moving in the right direction given corporate expense reductions. "Unfortunately, brand turnarounds take time and sales may be volatile in the interim," the analysts add. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)

2009 GMT - Canada's obsession with housing poses a stiff headwind on efforts to improve the country's poor record on productivity, as consumers and investors have tended in the past decade to park their savings in real estate. "We need to change the incentives around home buying/selling in order to push people toward more productive endeavors," writes economist Benjamin Reitzes at BMO Capital Markets. A period of stagnant home prices, which Canada is presently witnesses, might prompt that shift in investment decisions, Reitzes said. He warns, however, this might be short lived should interest rates fall sharply from present levels and policymakers lift the brakes on immigration-fueled population growth.

1910 GMT - Gold briefly climbs to new intraday highs over $2,900 a troy ounce following economic data early in the session, before ending up 0.4% to $2,867.30 an ounce. It's the second-highest ever close. Analysts are calling for gold to continue its rise to $3,000 an ounce. "The gold bull market looks set to continue under Trump 2.0 with trade wars and geopolitical tensions reinforcing the reserve diversification/de-dollarization trend," Citi says in a note. SPDR Gold rises 0.3%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)

1807 GMT - Coty will likely remain bearish around the state of the beauty industry in its upcoming results, expected for Monday. While the company will likely benefit from a growing fragrance market in the U.S., its color cosmetics business is expected to be weaker. That market is rapidly slowing, according to L'Oréal's Finance Chief Christophe Babule. Coty, together with its peers in the beauty industry, have lost billions of dollars in market cap. Coty currently has a market value of around $5.9 billion, down around 40% from a year ago. e.l.f. Beauty, one of its biggest competitors on the CoverGirl brand side, has seen its stock plunge nearly 60%, while Estée Lauder has lost 55%. Industry giant L'Oreal has remained in a more stable position, but has still experienced stock losses of around 19%. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)The market is embracing Bill Ackman's acquired stake in Uber Technologies through Pershing Square, driving gains for both the billionaire's investment fund and the ride-sharing app. Shares of the San Francisco-based company are currently trading up around 9.2% at $76.45, making Ackman's 30.3-million-share position worth $2.32 billion. The executive believes Uber is highly undervalued and says it will share more about its plans for the company shortly. "We believe that Uber is one of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world. Remarkably, it can still be purchased at a massive discount to its intrinsic value," he said in a post on X.(sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)

1450 GMT - The Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index rose slightly, by 0.3 points, to 73.4 in January, recovering from its first decline since July. This uptick was driven by increased consumer optimism about homebuying and selling conditions, as well as heightened expectations for rising home prices over the next year. About 43% of respondents now expect home prices to increase, up from 38%, while the net share of people believing home prices will go up jumped 9 percentage points to 20%. However, optimism about declining mortgage rates waned, with the net share expecting lower rates dropping 13 percentage points to 3%. Additionally, 65% of consumers anticipate higher rental prices, up 8 percentage points from last month. Year-over-year, the index is up 2.7 points. Perceptions of good or bad times to buy or sell homes remained unchanged month-over-month. (chris.wack@wsj.com)

1053 GMT - Legal & General Group's U.S. insurance businesses sale makes strategic sense and the subsequent capital returns boost management's credibility after disappointing returns from the Cala sale, BofA Securities analysts write. L&G plans to return 1.0 billion pounds of the funds to shareholders via buybacks upon completion of the deal. The analysts say they already expected a 500 million pound buyback in this year and now see scope for about 1.2 billion next year. Shares are up 5.5% at 252.0 pence and are leading the FTSE 100-index gainers.(ian.walker@wsj.com.)

0956 GMT - Banco de Sabadell's fourth-quarter pretax profit was ahead of consensus, driven by higher-than-expected core revenues and lower-than-expected costs, RBC Capital Markets analyst Pablo de la Torre Cuevas says in a research note. The Spanish bank's result reflected an unexpected 50 million-euro reduction in taxes, helping quarterly net profit of 532 million euros exceed expectations of 453 million, the analyst says. RBC expects Sabadell to deliver resilient earnings in the coming years and to benefit from the anticipated recovery in Spanish lending. Sabadell shares trade down 0.7% at 2.39 euros.

0949 GMT - Although Ashmore Group's 1H outflows continued, there has been a persistent improvement as 2Q net outflows were just $400 million, Peel Hunt analysts Stuart Duncan and Robert Sage say. This in turn saw total assets under management falling just 1% to close at $48.8 billion, and Ebitda above consensus expectations at 34 million pounds, the analysts say in a note. Net management fees fell 17% to 68 million pounds, a reflection of lower AuMs and revenue margins moderating above expectations, which were offset by well-controlled costs, the analysts say. "Having faced significant challenges for some time, there remains a more positive tone to the outlook," the analysts say. Shares are down 0.5% at 170.70 pence and up 6.75% in the year-to-date.

0940 GMT - Legal & General Group's U.S. insurance-businesses sale is a surprise as neither of the units were included in the company's corporate-investments unit set out in its capital markets event in June, RBC Europe analyst Mandeep Jagpal and associate Dawid Pych write. The unit was set up to oversee assets and businesses that the company decided didn't fit with its strategy. "The deal highlights to us that there remains significant upside to life-insurer valuations, which is being recognized by long-term investors," they say. Shares are up 6.8% at 255.10 pence and are leading FTSE 100 index gainers. (ian.walker@wsj.com.)
