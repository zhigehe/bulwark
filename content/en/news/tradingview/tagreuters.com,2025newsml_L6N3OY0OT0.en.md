(The Insurer) - Axis Capital has hired Emilia Siravo, former head of intra-group retrocession and process management at Swiss Re, as head of ceded reinsurance for North America.

Siravo has more than 20 years of experience in the industry. Before Swiss Re, where she spent over six years, she was a catastrophe modeller at Guy Carpenter.

"[Siravo] will drive our North America Ceded Re strategy and execution, contributing to the development of the companyâ€™s gross and net portfolio," Axis said in a LinkedIn post announcing her appointment.

On Wednesday, Axis promoted Steve Cucciniello to head of primary casualty.
