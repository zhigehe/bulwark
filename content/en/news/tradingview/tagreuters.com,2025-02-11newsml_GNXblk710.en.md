BELVIDERE, NJ, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Edible Garden AG Incorporated (“Edible Garden” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW), a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic, and sustainable produce and products, today announced the successful completion of its pilot production of Squeezables - a new line of shelf-stable, stir in paste herbs designed to revolutionize the fresh condiments category – paving the way for a full-scale ramp-up. This innovation enhances the way consumers experience herbs and condiments, providing a longer shelf life, bold fresh flavor, and a fully recyclable packaging solution that aligns with Edible Garden’s commitment to sustainability and its Zero-Waste Inspired® mission.

“Squeezables, our new line of squeezable herbs, represent a major advancement in how consumers experience condiments,” said Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden. “We developed this product to offer a fresh, convenient alternative to traditional pantry staples. What sets Squeezables apart is their extended shelf life—even after opening—while preserving their bold, fresh flavor. Keeping them refrigerated ensures they remain just as vibrant and flavorful as the day they were opened.”

“Sustainability is at the heart of Squeezables. We designed the packaging to be fully recyclable, reinforcing our commitment to reducing environmental impact. Our goal is to create products that are not only better for consumers but also better for the planet. Additionally, Squeezables' longer shelf life helps retailers across the U.S. minimize waste while maintaining high consumer satisfaction. By leveraging our established retail partnerships, we are confident in our ability to scale production and distribution efficiently.”

“Squeezables align perfectly with Edible Garden’s reputation as ‘The Flavor Maker.’ These condiments provide a vibrant, natural taste that enhances any meal, setting them apart in a crowded market. As consumers increasingly seek sustainable, better-for-you options, we are proud to offer a product that meets both needs—freshness and environmental responsibility. We believe Squeezables are more than just a condiment, they represent a shift toward healthier, more sustainable food choices. We look forward to continuing to innovate and introducing even more fresh, flavorful products to market in the future.”
