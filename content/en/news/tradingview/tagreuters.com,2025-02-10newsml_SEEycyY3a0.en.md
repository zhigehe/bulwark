PODGORICA (Montenegro), February 10 (SeeNews) - Flag carrier ToMontenegro, operating under the Air Montenegro brand, said on Monday its revenue rose by an annual 33%, i.e. by 470,000 euro ($488,000), in the first month of 2025.

The company did not provide a figure for the overall revenue it collected in January in a statement on its website, noting the increase was supported by an annual rise of 29% in the number of transported passengers totalling 24,245 in January. Furthermore, Air Montenegro carried out 334 flights in the first month of the year, up 27% on the year.

The results indicate a stable and positive growth trend for Montenegro's national air carrier as it marks its fourth anniversary, the company said, adding that it expects even better results in the coming months.

In January 2021, the Montenegrin government established Air Montenegro as a new national air carrier to replace previous Montenegro Airlines which went into liquidation. The government controls 100% of the flag carrier.

($ = 0.964 euro)
