Trump's apparent pivot away from a flat universal tariff to ones on a country-by-country basis will likely lead to an even bigger rise in average tariffs and in U.S. consumer prices, says Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth. "We have no idea of the formula to be used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs," the chief North America economist says, adding that if valued-added tax and the most-favored nation tariffs rates are included, India and Brazil will be hit the hardest, followed by the EU, UK, Mexico and Canada. As for "winners," he names Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. The average effective tariffs on U.S. imports would jump to around 20% from less than 3%, adding roughly 2% to prices, temporarily pushing inflation to 4% later this year, he says.
