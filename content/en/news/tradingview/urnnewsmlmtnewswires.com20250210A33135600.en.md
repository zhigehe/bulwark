American Tungsten (TUNG.CN) has jumped 50% and has hit a fresh 52-week high on Monday after the company reaffirmed its strategic position amidst China's expanded tungsten export controls in response to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.

The company believes this strategic move is expected to further tighten the global supply of tungsten and believes it also positions TUNG to play a "potentially pivotal role" in meeting growing domestic demand.

The company also believes the inclusion of tungsten in these controls underscores China's intent to protect its strategic resources and results in potential disruptions through international supply chains.

"China's recent decision to further restrict tungsten exports marks a significant turning point for the global minerals market," said American Tungsten Chief Executive Murray Nye. "This policy change not only underscores the strategic importance of tungsten, but also highlights the urgent need for a reliable, domestic source of this critical mineral. American Tungsten is planning to be fully prepared to meet this demand, ensuring that the U.S. has access to the high-quality tungsten they require for innovation and national defense."

Shares of the company were last seen up $0.66 at $1.99, hitting a 52-week high of $2.04, in morning trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange.
