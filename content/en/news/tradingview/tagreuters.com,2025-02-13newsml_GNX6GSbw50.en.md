These awards are a testament to the accomplishments of our employees in the four years since we announced our strategy to become the premier full-service financial institution headquartered in Texas.”

**Award Methodology**

**Bankrate:** Bankrate evaluated the range of deposit products offered, along with fees, minimum balance requirements, availability of competitive APYs, extent of ATM network and key digital banking features.

Newsweek – America’s Best Regional Banks and Credit Unions: Newsweek utilized the Texas Ratio (a measure of a bank's credit quality) as well as reviewed profitability and net loans and leases, press coverage over the past two years, an elaborate large-scale independent customer survey of more than 71,000 U.S. citizens, 1.9 million social media reviews and 129 million Apple App store and Google Play store reviews.
