Likewise said that 2025 has started well, driven by continuing positive momentum, and that it is confident in meeting its medium-term targets.

The U.K. floor-coverings distributor on Monday said that total sales revenue increased by 8.4% in January, and Likewise-branded businesses increased by 13.6%.

The company said it has product launches planned for the first and second quarter, which will be supported by actions to materially increase its presence in independent flooring retailers and contractors.

"The momentum developed in the second half of 2024 has continued in the early part of 2025 providing the group with confidence in an exciting future and further progress toward our medium-term objectives," Chief Executive Tony Brewer said.

The company also said it had completed the acquisition of a logistics center in Ivybridge, U.K., for 1.2 million pounds ($1.5 million), increasing the group's freehold property portfolio to 23.3 million pounds.

The acquisition completes Likewise's geographical coverage of the U.K., it added.
