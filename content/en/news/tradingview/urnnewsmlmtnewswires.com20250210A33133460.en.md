Bravo Mining reported Monday assays from the final seven diamond drill holes of a 2024 infill and step-out drilling program in the Central Sector of its Luanga palladium-platinum-rhodium-gold-nickel deposit in Brazil.

Highlights include 39 meters at 2.34 grams per tonne (g/t) platinum group metals and gold (PGM+Au), 34 meters at 2.24 g/t PGM+Au, and 36 meters at 2.21 g/t PGM+Au.

Bravo said it will use the results for an upcoming mineral resource estimate (MRE) update.

"Drilling consistently intercepts substantial mineralized thicknesses and grades, often matching or exceeding results from earlier drill holes on the same section," said Luis Azevedo, Bravo's chairman and CEO. "We are extremely pleased with the outcomes of our 2024 drilling and trenching programs, which were completed under budget and have set a positive outlook for the forthcoming MRE update."

Bravo's share price rose nearly 1% on Friday to $2.1 on the TSXV.
