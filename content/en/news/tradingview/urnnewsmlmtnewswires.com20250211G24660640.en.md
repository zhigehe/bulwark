CleanTech Lithium said Monday it plans to raise gross proceeds of up to 2.4 million pounds sterling through a placement of new shares at 0.16 pound apiece.

The exploration and development company also granted a broker option for up to 12.5 million shares to Fox-Davies to raise an additional 2 million pounds. Exercisable until Feb. 25, the option is intended to deal with demand from investors who do not participate in the placing.

Net proceeds will be used to advance capital programs and feasibility studies at Laguna Verde, Chile, in the first quarter, finance listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, completion of the first stage of the DLE pilot plant, and to meet general working capital needs.
