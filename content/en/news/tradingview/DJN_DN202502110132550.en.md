Aluminum falls in early Asian trade. Volatility in the aluminum market is likely to remain high after U.S. President Trump announced tariffs on U.S. imports, ANZ Research analysts write in a note. On Monday, Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. There could be upward pressure on prices, as the U.S. aluminum industries are expected to struggle to avoid the tariffs in the short term, the analysts say. The three-month LME aluminum contract is down 0.6% at $2,627.00/ton. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)
