In 2024, Amarc successfully completed programs at its BC JOY, DUKE and IKE Copper-Gold ("Cu-Au") Districts. Some $23 million was spent on 29,000 m of drilling and extensive geophysical, geochemical and geological surveys (see Amarc November 20, 2024 release), including:

* Some 16,883 m of core drilling in 40 drill holes tested eight targets at the JOY District, including the PINE Deposit, the Canyon discovery and the Twins, and Northwest Gossan ("NWG") deposit targets. The new high grade AuRORA discovery was made in the NWG area at JOY.
* A two-phase program was completed at the DUKE District, including 4,828 m in nine holes, further defining Cu-Mo mineralization in the central portion of the DUKE Deposit as well as identifying potentially important volumes of additional mineralization to the south and north of the main Deposit and 5,815 m in 19 holes, testing District Cu-Au targets across the DUKE District.
* Nine holes testing the potential of the higher grade historical Empress Cu-Au Deposit at its IKE Cu-Au District.

Results from programs across all Districts are planned for release in Q1 2025.

**About Amarc Resources Ltd.**

Amarc is a mineral exploration and development company with an experienced and successful management team focused on developing a new generation of long-life, high-value porphyry Cu-Au mines in BC. By combining high-demand projects with dynamic management, Amarc has created a solid platform to create value from its exploration and development-stage assets.

Amarc is advancing its 100%-owned JOY, DUKE and IKE porphyry Cu±Au districts located in different prolific porphyry regions of southern, central and northern BC, respectively. Each district represents significant potential for the development of multiple and important-scale, porphyry Cu±Au deposits. Importantly, each of the three districts is located in proximity to industrial infrastructure - including power, highways and rail.

Freeport-McMoRan Mineral Properties Canada Inc. ("Freeport"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. at JOY and Boliden Mineral Canada Ltd. ("Boliden"), an entity within the Boliden Group of companies at DUKE, can earn up to a 70% interest in each District through staged investments of $110 million and $90 million, respectively. Together this provides Amarc with potentially up to $200 million in non-share dilutive staged funding for these Districts. In addition, Amarc has completed self-funded drilling at its higher-grade Empress Deposit in the IKE District. Additional drill results from core holes at JOY, as well as those completed in 2024 at DUKE and IKE are being compiled for release in Q1 2025. Amarc is the operator of all programs.

Amarc is associated with HDI, a diversified, global mining company with a 35-year history of porphyry Cu deposit discovery and development success. Previous and current HDI projects include some of BC's and the world's most important porphyry deposits - such as Pebble, Mount Milligan, Southern Star, Kemess South, Kemess North, Gibraltar, Prosperity, Xietongmen, Newtongmen, Florence, Casino, Sisson, Maggie, IKE, PINE, DUKE and AuRORA. From its head office in Vancouver, Canada, HDI applies its unique strengths and capabilities to acquire, develop, operate and monetize mineral projects.

Amarc works closely with local governments, Indigenous groups and stakeholders in order to advance its mineral projects responsibly, and in a manner that contributes to sustainable community and economic development. We pursue early and meaningful engagement to ensure our mineral exploration and development activities are well coordinated and broadly supported, address local priorities and concerns, and optimize opportunities for collaboration. In particular, we seek to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with Indigenous groups within whose traditional territories our projects are located, through the provision of jobs, training programs, contract opportunities, capacity funding agreements and sponsorship of community events. All Amarc work programs are carefully planned to achieve high levels of environmental and social performance.
