The Open Network, also known as TON, has integrated with the interoperability protocol LayerZero for cross-chain asset transfers across more than 100 blockchains — beginning with Ethereum, Tron, Solana and nine other chains.

TON's integration with LayerZero aims to help solve the former's limitations in liquidity and access to other blockchain's major crypto assets by providing access to multi-chain liquidity. According to a press release, "TON is now able to deliver sustainable liquidity and improve accessibility to its ecosystem, setting the stage for widespread adoption."

Key partners leveraging LayerZero's infrastructure on TON include consortium USDT0, Ethena and cross-chain bridge Stargate, the press release states.

“We believe this integration marks a significant step forward for TON when it comes to uniting ecosystems and bringing greater interoperability to the broader crypto ecosystem," Max Pertsovskiy, TON Foundation's Chief Operating Officer, said.

"By connecting TON to a wide variety of other chains, developers now have all the tools they need to build decentralized applications for a truly global audience," Pertsovskiy added.
