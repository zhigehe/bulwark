Asia's middle distillates spot trading momentum was brisk on the trading window despite falling paper prices, with traders expecting more March sale activities from refiners to emerge soon.

The March east-west arbitrage was little changed at around $27 per ton at the market's close, maintaining at nearly a one-month-wide level, providing some slight sentiment support.

Some traders were hoping for more swing suppliers to start pivoting their cargoes to the west soon, amid wider spreads from a month earlier, which could lead to better seller margins.

So far, around 280,000 metric tons of India-origin diesel will be heading to Europe for February loading, compared with 65,000 tons last month, LSEG tracking data showed.

The 10ppm sulphur gasoil refining margins (GO10SGCKMc1) hovered at one-month-high levels of around $17.3 a barrel.

Asian prices were still under pressure from ample inventories in key storage hub Singapore amid slow moving regional demand, one trade source said.

Cash differentials (GO10-SIN-DIF) climbed for the second straight session to around 22 cents a barrel as aggressive buying interest resumed on the trading window for March spot cargoes.

Regrade (JETREG10SGMc1) values were almost rolled over from a day earlier at a discount of 96 cents per barrel.
