Heineken Malaysia's 2025 earnings outlook could remain strong, driven by product innovations and advertising and promotion investments in core brands, Maybank IB analyst Jade Tam says in a note. The brewer may benefit from stronger sales momentum amid higher inbound visitors, but risks include geopolitical uncertainties and forex volatility, she reckons. Tam raises Heineken's 2025-2026 earnings forecasts by 9% and 8%, respectively, on expected higher margins. Maybank raises Heineken's target price to MYR33.00 from MYR30.20 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is 4.8% higher at MYR26.00. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
