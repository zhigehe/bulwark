Nordic forward power prices slipped on Tuesday, pressured by lower energy rates in related markets, but falling water reserves limited further downside.

\* Nordic front-quarter baseload power contract (ENOFBLQc1) was down 0.4 euros at 26.1 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) as of 1039 GMT.

\* Nordic front-year prices (ENOFBLYc1) lost 0.2 euros to 37.55 euros.

\* "The German market together with gas prices trading lower today seems to be the main driver behind Nordic forward prices falling a little bit," said Stefan Barkholt Ovesen, head of power trading curve at Norlys Energy Trading.

\* Dutch and British wholesale gas prices retreated from two-year highs but concerns over storage levels and lower temperatures provided support.

\* German year-ahead power (TRDEBYc1) fell 0.8 euros to 100.75 euros per MWh.

\* In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract (CFI2Zc1) fell 0.81 euros to 82.13 euros a tonne.

\* Nordic water reserves available 15 days ahead (PCAEC00) were seen at 7.67 terawatt hours (TWh) above normal, compared with 8.52 TWh on Monday.

\* "A stable high-pressure system over Northern Europe will dominate the weather in Scandinavia with cold and dry air. Wind speeds will be low to moderate at most," Georg Muller, a meteorologist at LSEG, said in a note.

\* "The rest of this week and likely also the entire next week will be dry and colder than normal with sunny intervals," Muller added.

\* The Nordic power price for next-day physical delivery (FXSYSAL=NPX), or system price, fell 1.42 euros to 50.69 euros per MWh.
