Meitu expects to record about 103% to 116% increase in its net profit attributable to owners in 2024 compared with the preceding year, a Friday Hong Kong bourse filing said.

The technology company attributed the expected increase to a rise in revenue and gross profit from its core business resulting from the integration of artificial intelligence, growth in revenue from overseas markets, and one-off net gains from the disposals of all cryptocurrencies held by the group.
