Magyar Bancorp, Inc., a community-focused financial institution, has released its latest Form 10-Q report, showcasing robust financial and operational performance. The report highlights significant growth in key financial metrics and strategic business initiatives that underscore the company's commitment to enhancing shareholder value and operational efficiency.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Interest and Dividend Income**: $12.9 million, an increase of 11.7% compared to the same period last year, driven by higher market interest rates on loans and investments.

**Net Interest and Dividend Income**: $7.4 million, up by 2.8% from the previous year, attributed to a $44.1 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets.

**Net Income**: $2.1 million, a significant rise of 26.2% from the previous year, due to higher net interest income, lower provisions for credit losses, and increased other income.

**Earnings per Share - Basic and Diluted**: $0.34, up from $0.26 in the previous year, reflecting improved profitability.

**Provision for Credit Losses**: $101 thousand, a substantial decrease from $481 thousand in the previous year, owing to growth in total loans receivable and net recoveries of previously charged-off loans.

**Business Highlights**

**Commercial Real Estate Loan Growth**: The company experienced significant growth in its commercial real estate loans, which increased by $20.1 million, or 4.4%, to $481.4 million, representing 59.7% of total loans. This growth was primarily driven by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, with notable increases in retail, hotel/motel, and professional sectors.

**Construction Loan Expansion**: Construction loans saw an increase of $3.3 million, reflecting the company's focus on supporting development projects. This segment primarily includes loans to developers and investors for residential and commercial construction.

**Residential Real Estate Loan Performance**: One-to-four family residential real estate loans, including home equity lines of credit, increased by $2.2 million. This segment remains a stable component of the company's loan portfolio.

**New Branch Office**: The company opened a new branch office in Martinsville, NJ, which contributed to increased occupancy expenses. This strategic move is expected to enhance customer service and accessibility in the region.

**Branch Relocation and Cost Savings**: The relocation of the Bankâ€™s branch office from Bridgewater to Martinsville is anticipated to save the company $225 thousand per year, demonstrating a focus on operational efficiency.

**Interest Rate Environment Impact**: The company benefited from higher market interest rates, which contributed to a 33-basis point increase in the yield on earning assets. This reflects the company's ability to capitalize on favorable interest rate conditions.

**Future Outlook on Commercial Real Estate**: Management believes that the company has implemented appropriate risk management practices for its commercial real estate portfolio, including risk assessments and stress testing under adverse economic conditions.

**Non-Performing Loans and Asset Quality**: Despite an increase in non-performing loans by $107 thousand, the company's asset quality remains strong, with a low ratio of non-performing loans to total loans at 0.04%.

**Allowance for Credit Losses**: The allowance for credit losses increased by $204 thousand to $8.2 million, reflecting the company's proactive approach to managing potential credit risks associated with loan growth.

**Deposit Growth**: Total deposits increased by $52.2 million, or 6.5%, driven by growth in money market accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts, indicating strong customer confidence and liquidity management.
