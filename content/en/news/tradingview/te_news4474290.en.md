Steel rebar futures dropped to around CNY 3,200 per tonne, hitting a nearly one-month low after Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, effective March 4.

While foreign steel accounts for a small share of US consumption, key industries like aerospace, auto manufacturing, and energy depend on specialty imports.

Major steel exporters to the US include Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam.

In response, the EU vowed to protect its interests, while South Korea held emergency talks with steelmakers to minimize the impact.

Hyundai Steel expressed concerns over potential export price hikes and a reduction in South Koreaâ€™s annual duty-free steel quota, which had been set at 70% of the average volumes shipped to the US from 2015-2017.
