The yield on Italy’s 10-year BTP extended gains above 3.5%, reaching its highest level in over a week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled to Congress that the US central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates, citing a resilient economy, low unemployment, and inflation still above the 2% target.

Investors now turn their focus to Wednesday’s US inflation report for further insight into the Fed’s next move.

Meanwhile, market sentiment remained cautious as trade tensions between the EU and the US escalated.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to take “firm and proportionate” action after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

On the monetary policy front, the European Central Bank is expected to continue easing, with at least three more rate cuts projected by year-end as policymakers seek to bolster growth amid sluggish economic activity and inflation remaining within target levels.
