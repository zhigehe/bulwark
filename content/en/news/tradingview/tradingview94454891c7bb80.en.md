**Challenges and Risks**

PPL Corp faces several challenges and risks inherent to the utility industry:

* **Regulatory Risks:** The company’s operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulations, which could lead to increased costs or operational changes. Changes in environmental regulations, particularly those affecting coal-fired generation, could result in significant compliance costs.
* **Operational Risks:** The company’s profitability is highly dependent on its ability to recover costs through approved rates. Delays or failures in capital projects, supply chain disruptions, and natural disasters could adversely affect operations.
* **Market Risks:** Rising interest rates and adverse credit market conditions could increase capital costs. The company is also exposed to risks from potential changes in tax laws and regulations.
* **Emerging Risks:** Cybersecurity threats and the integration of artificial intelligence pose new challenges. AI technologies, if not properly managed, could lead to operational interruptions or compliance issues.
* **Climate Change Risks:** The potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency of severe weather events, could disrupt operations and lead to significant costs.

Management is focused on addressing these risks through strategic initiatives, including investments in grid modernization and renewable energy projects. The company aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which involves retiring coal-fired generation and investing in new technologies. PPL is also enhancing its cybersecurity measures to protect against emerging threats.
