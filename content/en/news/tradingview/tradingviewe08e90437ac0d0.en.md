Getty Realty Corp., a net lease REIT specializing in convenience and automotive retail real estate, has released its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024. The company reported strong investment and operating results, reflecting its strategic focus on growth and diversification.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Getty Realty Corp. reported net earnings of $0.39 per share, with Funds From Operations (FFO) at $0.57 per share and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) at $0.60 per share. The company invested $76.4 million across 21 properties, achieving an initial cash yield of 8.9%.

For the full year 2024, net earnings were $1.25 per share, FFO was $2.21 per share, and AFFO was $2.34 per share. The company invested $209.0 million across 78 properties, with an initial cash yield of 8.3%.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Getty Realty Corp. saw a 14.6% increase in base rental income for the fourth quarter, reaching $48.7 million, and a 14.3% increase for the full year, totaling $185.0 million. This growth was driven by revenue from newly acquired properties, contractual rent increases, and rent commencements from completed redevelopments.

During the fourth quarter, the company acquired 19 properties, including convenience stores, car washes, auto service centers, and a quick service restaurant. Additionally, incremental development funding was provided for the construction of new car washes.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In 2024, Getty Realty Corp. raised approximately $290 million through capital markets activities and refinanced its credit facility. The company also sold 31 properties for gross proceeds of $13.1 million, recording a net gain of $5.9 million.

Looking ahead, the company has a committed investment pipeline of over $35.0 million for the development and acquisition of various retail properties. The company is well-positioned with nearly $240 million of committed equity and debt capital available for acquisitions in 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Christopher J. Constant, Getty’s President & CEO, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting the 4.0% increase in AFFO per share for 2024. He emphasized the company's progress towards long-term growth and diversification objectives, and its ability to leverage tenant relationships and underwriting expertise for additional investments.

**Future Outlook**

Getty Realty Corp. has adjusted its 2025 AFFO guidance to $2.38 to $2.41 per diluted share, accounting for the potential impact of a recent tenant bankruptcy filing. The outlook includes completed transaction activity and the issuance and repayment of unsecured notes but excludes assumptions for prospective acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activities.
