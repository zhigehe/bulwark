German equities staged a last-minute recovery on Tuesday, as global markets assessed the rising geopolitical tensions between the European Union and the US after President Donald Trump's wheel of tariffs landed on steel and aluminum imports.

After spending much of the session flat, the blue-chip DAX index was 0.58% in the green at closing.

Trump announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, "without exceptions or exemptions." The new duties are set to take effect March 12, according to the executive orders signed by the US president.

"I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. "Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered - they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures. The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests."

With Tuesday's economic calendar relatively quiet, investors are focused on the data releases in the coming days. Germany will release its latest current account report on Wednesday, while the final inflation print for January is due on Thursday. Capping off the week is the wholesale price index for January on Friday.

On the corporate side, TUI reported a year-over-year increase in its fiscal first quarter revenue, with a lower attributable loss for the three months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024. The tourism company, however, was down 10.80% at closing.

"The fiscal first quarter is a weak quarter in TUI's seasonal business, comprising the last month of the summer season and the first two months of the winter season," mwb Research said. "Since the release of the FY24 results, the momentum in bookings and ASPs for both Winter 24/25 and Summer 25 has slowed somewhat."
