Sandnes, 10 February 2025:

Reference is made to the notice of an extraordinary general meeting publishedbyZaptec ASA (the "Company") on 7 February 2025. The shareholder group wishes tomake a clarification to its proposal to issue warrants to the proposed newexecutive chair.

In section 6 (viii) of the proposal, it is stated that "vesting is contingentonthe holder being employed or serving as a board member of the Company." Theproposal from the shareholder group is that this is amended to state that"vesting is contingent on the holder acting as an executive chair of theCompany". This will therefore be the proposal the shareholders are requestedtoconsider at the extraordinary general meeting.

As previously noted, the board's unanimous recommendation is to vote againsttheproposal.
