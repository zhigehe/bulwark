consolidated financial statements, and may vary materially from the year-end   
audited consolidated financial information for the same period. Any evaluation   
of the financial information presented in this press release should also take   
into account our published year-end audited consolidated financial statements   
and the notes to those statements. In addition, the financial information   
presented is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any   
future period. [2] In the fourth quarter of 2024, we adjusted our calculation   
method of revenue sourcing to focus on direct customers rather than end   
customers. We believe this method better reflects our current business   
environment. Consequently, we have retrospectively adjusted our customer   
metrics for the third quarter of 2024. [3] EBITDA stands for net income or   
loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment and   
investment gain or loss as well as other items. [4] Capital expenditure   
excludes building construction costs. [5] Short-term borrowings include   
short-term loans and bills payable.
