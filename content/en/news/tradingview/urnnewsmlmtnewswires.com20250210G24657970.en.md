Light Science Technologies said Monday it signed an extendable distribution framework agreement for the products developed by Agrolux Nederland, Gavita International's Dutch horticulture lighting subsidiary.

The deal allows the AIM-listed lighting, science, and plant monitoring services company to sell Agrolux's LED lighting systems in the UK and Irish markets. Plans to grant Agrolux the license to reciprocally sell the former's products are also part of the deal.

The transaction is expected to boost Light Science Technologies' overall quoted controlled environment agriculture pipeline to 42.5 million pounds sterling.
