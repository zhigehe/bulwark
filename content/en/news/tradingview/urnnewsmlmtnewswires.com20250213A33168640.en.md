International Paper said Thursday it will permanently shutdown multiple facilities in the US by the end of April.

The facilities include The Red River containerboard mill in Campti, Louisiana, a recycling plant in Phoenix, Arizona, a box plant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and a sheet feeder facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

The closure of the Red River containerboard mill is projected to decrease the company's containerboard capacity by nearly 800,000 tons per year, the company said.

The closures are expected to impact 674 employees, including 495 hourly and 179 salaried workers, International Paper said, adding that it plans to mitigate the impact through attrition, retirements, relocations, and support services for the employees.

Shares of International Paper were up more than 2% in recent Thursday trading.
