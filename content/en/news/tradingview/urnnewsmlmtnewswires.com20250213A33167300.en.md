US initial jobless claims fell to 213,000 in the week ended Feb. 8 from an upwardly revised 220,000 level in the previous week, compared with expectations for a smaller decrease to 216,000 in survey of analysts compiled by Bloomberg as of 7:30 am ET.

The four-week moving average fell by 1,000 to 216,000 after rising by 4,250 to a level of 217,000 in the previous week.

Insured jobless claims fell by 36,000 to 1,850,000 in week ended Feb. 1.

The weekly initial jobless claims data released by the US Labor Department measures filings for unemployment insurance benefits. Initial filings are reported through the previous Saturday, while those already on benefits are measured with a one-week lag.

A decrease in claims suggests a stronger labor market, a positive for the US economy and stocks, but a negative for bonds as it suggests wage growth that could lead to inflation.
