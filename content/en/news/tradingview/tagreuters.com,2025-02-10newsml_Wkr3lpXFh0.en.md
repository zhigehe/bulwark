Arise AB

During the period between 3 February 2025 and 7 February 2025 Arise AB (publ) (LEI code 549300FOT7EE85QYB655) (“Arise”) repurchased, in total, 29,109 own shares (ISIN code SE0002095604) under the share repurchase program initiated by the Board of Directors to deliver shareholder value and to optimize the capital structure of the company.

The share buy-backs form a part of the share repurchase program of a maximum amount of SEK 50 million, which Arise announced on 10 January 2025. The share repurchase program, which runs from 31 January 2025 until the date of Arise's Annual General Meeting in 2025, is being carried out in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (“MAR”) and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/1052 (the “Safe Harbour Regulation”). The purpose of the repurchase of the ordinary shares is to adapt the Company's capital structure to its capital requirements over time, and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. The intention is currently that the ordinary shares that have been repurchased will then be cancelled by resolutions at future General Meetings.

Arise shares have been repurchased (in SEK) as follows:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 07/02/2025 | 5,398 | 36.7985 | 198,638.30 |  |  |

A full breakdown of the transactions pursuant to article 5.3 of MAR and article 2.3 of the Safe Harbour Regulation is attached to this announcement.
