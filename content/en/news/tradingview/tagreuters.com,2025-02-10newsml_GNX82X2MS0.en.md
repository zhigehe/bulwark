MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (“Sun Country Airlines”) today announced the commencement of a proposed secondary public offering of 6,346,105 shares of its common stock by an affiliate of certain investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the “Selling Stockholder”), which represent all the remaining shares owned by the Selling Stockholder.

Sun Country Airlines is not selling any shares and will not receive any proceeds from the proposed offering.

In addition, Sun Country Airlines has authorized the purchase from the underwriters of approximately $10 million of shares of common stock that are the subject of the proposed offering at a price per share equal to the price at which the underwriters will purchase the shares from the Selling Stockholder in the proposed offering, subject to a maximum aggregate repurchase price of $10 million (the “Concurrent Share Repurchase”). Sun Country Airlines plans to fund the Concurrent Share Repurchase from existing cash on hand.

Barclays and Morgan Stanley are acting as joint bookrunners and underwriters for the proposed offering. The underwriters for the offering may offer the shares of common stock for sale from time to time directly or through agents, or through brokers in one or more brokerage transactions on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.

The offering will be made only by means of a preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus related to the offering, copies of which, when available, may be obtained from Barclays Capital Inc., c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717, or by telephone at 888-603-5847, or by email at Barclaysprospectus@broadridge.com or Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Attn: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10014.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. A shelf registration statement relating to the offering of the common stock was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is effective.
