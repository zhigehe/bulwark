*Eliminates +$10 Million Future Lease Payments*Optimizes Distribution & Fulfillment Network Estimated to Yield $1 Million Net Savings AnnuallyContinued Execution of Management’s Productivity & Transformation Agenda

PLANO, Texas, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Stryve Foods, Inc. (“Stryve” or the “Company”), a leader in high-protein, better-for-you snacking, today announced the successful completion of a major network optimization initiative, marking another milestone in the Company’s ongoing transformation. By transitioning fulfillment operations to a combination of redistribution partners, including Dot Foods, distributors, and third-party logistics providers, Stryve has successfully exited its final distribution center lease—an achievement expected to generate over $1 million in annual savings and drive significant operational efficiencies.

“This is a game-changer for Stryve,” said Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer. **“**By leveraging Dot Foods' expansive logistics network and optimizing our fulfillment strategy, we are not only reducing costs but also enhancing service levels for our retail partners. This move allows us to focus on what we do best—innovating, manufacturing, and marketing our brands—while letting best-in-class logistics partners handle distribution.”

**Maximizing Efficiency and Savings**

This transition delivers substantial financial and operational benefits to Stryve, including:

* + $1 million in expected annual net savings, achieved through improved operating efficiencies, reduced transportation costs, and rent savings.
* Eliminating + $10 million in future lease obligations, freeing up capital for strategic investments and growth.
* Enhanced service levels for retail partners, leading to improved product availability and expanded distribution reach.

As previously announced, Stryve’s partnership with Dot Foods has played a pivotal role in strengthening its supply chain. By leveraging Dot’s expertise, the Company is now better positioned to support growing consumer demand while streamlining its operations.

**Continuing the Transformation**

This milestone follows a series of strategic initiatives that have bolstered Stryve’s financial health and operational agility. Recent moves, such as the successful retirement of $8.7 million in debt and securing expanded retail distribution, underscore the Company’s commitment to sustainable, profitable growth​​​.

“As we continue to execute our transformation, this optimization aligns perfectly with our mission to scale efficiently,” said Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer. “With a leaner, more focused infrastructure, we are positioned to accelerate growth while maintaining financial discipline.”

**Looking Ahead**

With the lease termination effective February 15, 2025, and the Dot Foods relationship already fully operational, Stryve expects to begin realizing savings from this network optimization in its Q1 2025 results. This initiative represents another critical step in the Company’s journey toward long-term profitability and shareholder value creation.
