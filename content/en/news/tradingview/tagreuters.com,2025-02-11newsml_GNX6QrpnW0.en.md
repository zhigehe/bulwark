CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — EcoClaim and Northbridge Financial are helping change the way insurance claims are handled by adding a focus on sustainability. Northbridge, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, has made a commitment to reducing emissions across its supply chain by encouraging its restoration vendors to become EcoClaim Certified Contractors and begin using EcoClaim’s TRAX software. This enables Northbridge’s three insurance brands, Northbridge Insurance, Federated Insurance, and TruShield Insurance, together with their vendors, to move beyond generic industry benchmarks by tracking real data and working toward measurable emissions reductions.

In addition to requiring EcoClaim Certification for their preferred contractors, Northbridge has also invested in sustainability training for its own claims staff, equipping them with the knowledge and tools to make environmental responsibility a part of their claims process.

“At Northbridge, we recognize that technology, tools, and training are key to driving meaningful change across our industry,” said Alfred DeSousa, Vice President, Claims National Field Services at Northbridge Financial. “By introducing EcoClaim’s software platform and certification model into our claims process, we’re working to reduce the impact of our operations and equipping our vendor network with the resources they need to take real action and achieve measurable results in reducing emissions and building greener practices.”

With these changes, Northbridge is empowering its network to reduce landfill waste, cut emissions, and lower costs, all while enabling practical, measurable sustainability improvements in every claim.

“Sustainability isn’t about vague goals, it’s about creating a clear pathway to measurable progress,” said Jodi Scarlett, CEO at EcoClaim. “Through this multi-year partnership, Northbridge is equipping their staff and contractors with the tools, data, and training they need to embed sustainability into their claims process and achieve tangible results.”
