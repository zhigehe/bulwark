Former Canadian finance minister Chrystia Freeland is championing a cap on profit margins from grocery-store owners, and a limit on credit-card interest rates in her bid to become the new leader of Canada's Liberal Party and next prime minister of Canada. In her latest policy statement, she says the cap of grocers' margins on essential items like dairy and produce, and credit-card rates of no greater than 15% will help alleviate the financial squeeze Canadian households face. She adds she would cut the tax rate on the first C$111,000 of income. Polling suggests she trails her main rival, former central banker Mark Carney, as the preferred Liberal leader. Liberal Party members pick a new leader on March 9, and that person will succeed Justin Trudeau as PM and likely be in the election campaign shortly afterward. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)
