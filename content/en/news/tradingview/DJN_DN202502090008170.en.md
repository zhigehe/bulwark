By Andrew Beaton

NEW ORLEANS-One thing to watch out for during tonight's game: an Eagles-heavy crowd. Over the course of this week, as the city has filled up with fans from across the country, the one color that has been impossible to miss has been Philadelphia's Kelly Green. Maybe Eagles fans are just more revved up for the game after losing to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl a couple of years ago. Or there could be some fatigue in Kansas City, which is going for its third consecutive title.

Whatever the reason, Eagles fans have seemed to outnumber Chiefs supporters all week-and not by a small margin, either. Fitting with that, Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts was cheered when he just ran onto the field while Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes was booed.
