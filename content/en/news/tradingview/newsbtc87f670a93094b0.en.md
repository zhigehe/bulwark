**XRP Price Dips Again**

XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.250 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price gained pace for a move above the $2.450 and $2.500 resistance levels.

The bulls pumped the price above the $2.70 level. However, the bears remained active near the $2.80 level. A high was formed at $2.780 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $2.50 level. The price dropped toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.7501 swing low to the $2.7750 high.

The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.450 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.60. A clear move above the $2.60 resistance might send the price toward the $2.780 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.880 resistance or even $2.920 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00.

**More Losses?**

If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.2650 level. The next major support is near the $2.1420 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.7501 swing low to the $2.7750 high.

If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.1420 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.
