The launch of $frxUSD and $sfrxUSD by Frax Finance, in partnership with BlackRock and superstate funds, could shake up the stablecoin market. Stablecoins get a lot of attention due to their steady value, and introducing a new one, especially backed by big names, might attract investors. If this stablecoin gains popularity, it could increase the demand for Frax tokens and push up the price. However, the stablecoin market is competitive, and it remains to be seen if this launch will truly impact prices. source
