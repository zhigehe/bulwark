DoorDash has been studying its approach to autonomous food deliveries for years, but it doesn't have anything to announce at the moment, CEO Tony Xu says on a call with analysts. Still, the company is excited about all of the challenges that come with autonomy, the executive says. "I think a lot of us certainly working in the field probably either hoped for or expected this to have come sooner, but I think you're seeing just a lot of exciting existence proof points of what's to come," Xu says. So far, the company and its peers are looking into the total costs of operations that would come with it, he adds. Shares rise 5.7%, to $204.15, after the market close.
