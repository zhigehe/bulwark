Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 0.1% lower at 1589.95. The local market could experience a pull-back due to profit-taking early this week, following data signaling rising U.S. inflation and President Trump's tougher tariff stance, TA Securities analyst Stephen Soo said in a note. However, select stocks could benefit from supply-chain diversification amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, providing rotational buying opportunities to sustain recovery momentum. Soo pegs the KLCI's support at 1550 and resistance at 1605. Among decliners, SD Guthrie was 2.2% lower and MISC Bhd. lost 2.0%. Meanwhile, Axiata Group added 3.2% and Sime Darby rose 1.8%. Malaysian markets will be closed Tuesday for the Thaipusam holiday. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)
