ANZ have published their forecast for the RBNZ meeting on Wednesday 19 February 2025.

In brief:

* We expect a 50bp cut in the OCR to 3.75% next Wednesday. That would be consistent with RBNZ November messaging, economists’ forecasts, and market pricing. Data since the November Monetary Policy Review has been mixed, but overall consistent with the RBNZ’s guidance.
* With the OCR now much closer to neutral and the economy showing clear signs of life, we expect more caution from the RBNZ from here – this is likely the last 50bp cut. However, given the RBNZ’s central estimate of neutral is 3%, the risks are tilted towards a lower OCR trough than the 3.5% we are forecasting.

More:

* tone to be one of confidence that the inflation outlook is benign
* while acknowledging upside risks to tradable and thus headline inflation
* OCR track will likely be lower ... we aren’t expecting a very large change in the track overall

On the currency:

* Assuming we don’t see a big change in the RBNZ’s track, we don’t think we will see significant market moves on the day, and volatility (in FX and interest rate markets) will likely continue to be driven by offshore events.
