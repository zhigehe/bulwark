**UMT United Mobility Technology AG: strategic co-operation with Buildsimple**

**AI-supported document processing and process automation from a single source**

Munich / Münster, 10.02.2025 (pta000/10.02.2025/12:08 UTC+1)

UMT United Mobility Technology AG ("UMT AG") and Buildsimple announce a joint strategic sales and integration partnership. Both companies will offer their customers customised End2End processes and AI solutions that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the respective operational processes.

The cooperation will create a powerful, automated and integrated solution that will help companies to organise their digital workflows more efficiently and intelligently.

This collaboration creates an end-to-end value chain in document processing: Buildsimple analyses, categorises and extracts documents of all kinds. With its "UMS Vision AI" solution, UMT AG takes over the second and third stages to further process, validate and compare the extracted data using artificial intelligence and enrich it with existing information. All this information is seamlessly transferred and integrated into the customer system.

**A win-win situation for both sides**

Through this cooperation, Buildsimple is expanding its range of services and can offer its customers a powerful AI solution for further automation with "UMS Vision AI". At the same time, UMT AG gains access to Buildsimple's advanced document recognition technology, which serves as the first module within the UMS Vision AI platform.

"The partnership with Buildsimple is a significant step in our mission to provide organisations with intelligent AI solutions that automate administrative processes and increase efficiency. By combining Buildsimple's precise document recognition with our solution, the 'artificial clerk', we can offer our customers a seamless end-to-end solution," explains Erik Nagel, CEO of UMT AG.

Buildsimple also sees great opportunities in the collaboration: "Our AI technology enables fast and accurate data capture from documents of all kinds. In conjunction with UMS Vision AI, companies can now integrate this data directly into their workflows and benefit from automated further processing. The partnership with UMT AG is therefore a real added value for our customers," says René Weseler, Senior Executive Manager of ISR Information Products AG, the developer of the Buildsimple platform.

**A market worth billions with growing requirements**

The automation of document processing and process control is one of the fastest-growing technology markets in the world. Companies are increasingly faced with the challenge of processing large volumes of information efficiently and simultaneously driving digital transformation. The combination of Buildsimple and UMS Vision AI provides a practical solution that is in high demand, particularly in sectors such as insurance, finance, logistics, healthcare and industry.

With this partnership, UMT AG and Buildsimple are positioning themselves as innovative pioneers in the field of AI-supported business processes in Germany and Europe and setting new standards for the digital future.
