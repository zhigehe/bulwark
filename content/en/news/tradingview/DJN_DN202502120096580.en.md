The U.K. Debt Management Office has lowered supply of long-dated gilts in recent years as demand for the assets has been falling, Barclays fixed income strategist Moyeen Islam says in a note. "U.K. gilt supply has seen its average maturity shorten as ultra-long... supply has been cut back heavily," Islam says. The legacy of previous issuances of long-dated bonds remains, however. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, supply was "deliberately skewed" towards long-dated gilts and inflation-linked gilts, he says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)
