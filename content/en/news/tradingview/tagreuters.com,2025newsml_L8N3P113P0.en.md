El Al Israel Airlines has signed a code-share agreement with Azerbaijan Airlines, the Israeli flag carrier said on Monday.

The collaboration adds to similar code-sharing deals with Delta , Air France and Virgin Atlantic as part of El Al's strategic plan to expand its network from Tel Aviv through partnerships with leading global airlines and expanding its flight schedule to popular destinations.

The latest agreement will add El Al's 'LY' flight code to Azerbaijan Airlines flights from Tel Aviv. The Azeri carrier operates two daily flights from Tel Aviv to Baku.

In the future, El Al's code will be added to connecting flights from Baku, it said.
