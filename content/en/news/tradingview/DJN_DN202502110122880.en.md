Many economists predicted that once pandemic-era stimulus ran dry, consumer spending would take a hit. But it isn't all that surprising that it didn't play out that way, because predictions of the consumer's demise often miss the mark, New York Fed President John Williams tells reporters. Supporting solid consumer-spending growth last year was a strong labor market, as well as strong asset performance in financial markets that boosted household wealth, Williams says. In 2025, Williams says that consumer-spending growth might slow slightly to conform better with a long-term trend line. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)
