Kraft Heinz forecast annual profit below estimates and missed quarterly sales estimates on Wednesday, as the packaged food maker faces sluggish demand for its products such as Lunchables and packaged meat following price hikes.

The company's shares were down about 2% in premarket trading.

Middle-to-lower income groups have reduced spending on categories like condiments and spices amid sticky inflation.

Kraft Heinz expects fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.74, compared with analysts' average estimates of $3.04, as per data compiled by LSEG.

The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $6.58 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $6.66 billion.
