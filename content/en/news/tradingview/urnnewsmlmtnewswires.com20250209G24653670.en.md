Radiopharm Theranostics said that a recently published study reported a methodology for detecting brain metastases using its proprietary radiotracer 18F-RAD101, according to a Monday Australian bourse filing.

A study published in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging investigated the imaging characteristics of brain metastases in 12 patients with no prior brain radiotherapy and 10 patients who had previously been treated with brain radiation.

The use of the radiotracer with Positron Emission Tomography and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging detected all brain metastases, regardless of the tumor of origin, with a high tumor-to-background ratio, the filing said.

The biopharmaceuticals firm's phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the radiotracer in patients with suspected recurrent brain metastasis from solid tumors of different origins is currently recruiting in the US.

The firm's shares fell 4% in recent trading on Monday.
