Malaysian palm oil futures extended their gains on Wednesday as trading resumed after a public holiday, supported by stronger prices in competing edible oils.

The benchmark palm oil contract for April delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange climbed 76 ringgit, or 1.65%, to 4,669 ringgit ($1,048.51) a metric ton in early trade.

FUNDAMENTALS

\* Dalian's most-active soyoil contract (DBYcv1) rose 0.27%, while its palm oil contract added 1.48%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade were up 0.65%.

\* Palm oil tracks price movements of rival edible oils, as it competes for a share of the global vegetable oils market.

\* Oil prices fell as an industry report showed an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and tariff worries weighed on sentiment. O/R

\* The ringgit , palm's currency of trade, strengthened 0.31% against the dollar, making the commodity more expensive for buyers holding foreign currencies.

\* European Union soybean imports for the 2024/25 season, which began in July, totaled 8.36 million metric tons by February 9, marking a 10% increase compared with the previous year. Meanwhile, palm oil imports reached 1.73 million tons, a 21% decline from the same period last year, according to data from the European Commission.

\* China's agriculture ministry kept its forecasts for corn, soybeans and other key crops in the 2024/25 crop year largely unchanged in its February outlook with a minor revision to soybean planted acreage from 10.321 million hectares to 10.325 million hectares.

\* Palm oil may retrace into a range of 4,494 ringgit to 4,523 ringgit per metric ton, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. TECH/C
