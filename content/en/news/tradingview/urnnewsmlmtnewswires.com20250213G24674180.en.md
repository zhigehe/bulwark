China launched a carrier rocket designed to send up bigger batches of satellites in a single launch on Tuesday from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan with several rockets, Reuters reported Tuesday.

These rockets can counter U.S. billionaire Elon Musk's presence in Earth's lower orbits via SpaceX. The technology allows greater fuel efficiency and longer life for the satellites. The rocket has enhanced payload capacity and can deliver multiple satellites in low and medium orbits in one launch, Reuters said, citing China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation (CASC).
