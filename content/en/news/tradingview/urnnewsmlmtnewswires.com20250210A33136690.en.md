(Recasts with report on Acting CFPB Director telling staff not to work)

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Russell Vought has instructed the agency's workers to do no work while its Washington, D.C. headquarters remains shut, multiple media outlets reported.

Vought issued the directive in an email to employees Monday morning, including an instruction that any urgent matters should be relayed to Mark Paoletta, the chief legal officer at the Office of Management and Budget, according to a Bloomberg report.

An email sent Saturday by Vought had instructed staff to suspend almost all regulatory activities, including supervising financial companies, CNBC reported. An internal memo seen by CNBC told employees Sunday to work remotely as the headquarters would be closed through Feb. 14, the report said.

The CFPB did not immediately reply to a request for comment from MT Newswires.
