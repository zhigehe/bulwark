Gildan Activewear's Q4 results will be in line with expectations as channel checks indicate strong fundamental business trends and a strong product pipeline for fiscal 2025, UBS Securities said in an earnings preview emailed Tuesday.

The company remains moderately long-crowded among investors, with a crowding score of 6.5, above the softlines industry average of 4.2, according to the preview.

The firm said it remains bullish on Gildan Activewear's long-term prospects as it holds a dominant position in the US imprintables market and has expansion opportunities internationally, while its low-cost production model provides a competitive advantage, supporting market share gains.

UBS has a buy rating on Gildan Activewear's stock with a price target of $60.
