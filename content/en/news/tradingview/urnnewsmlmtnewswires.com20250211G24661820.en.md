TikTok said it has allowed Android users in the US to download the app through package kits on its website, Reuters reported.

The workaround is seen as a way to circumvent the restrictions on the short video app in the country after a US law requiring parent ByteDance to sell TikTok's US operations on security grounds or face a ban took effect Jan. 19, the report said.

Apple and Google have not yet restored the app on their app stores since the law took effect, according to Reuters.

US President Donald Trump signed an order during his inauguration to delay the enforcement of the law by 75 days, Reuters said.
