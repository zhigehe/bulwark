US stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open, with S&P 500 futures up 0.3%, Dow Jones futures gaining over 70 points, and Nasdaq futures rising 0.4%, as investors weighed inflation data, earnings reports, and potential new tariffs.

A stronger-than-expected PPI reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep rates steady.

Meanwhile, markets remain on edge over President Trump’s tariff policies, which have already raised consumer inflation expectations.

Investors are also watching earnings, with Reddit shares down nearly 9% premarket after disappointing user growth, while Dutch Bros surged 24% on strong earnings and sales.

Upcoming reports from Airbnb, Coinbase, and Palo Alto Networks are set to provide further market direction after Thursday’s closing bell.
