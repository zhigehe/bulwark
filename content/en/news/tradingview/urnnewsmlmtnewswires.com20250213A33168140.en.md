TD Securities lowered its price target on Linamar Corp. to $66 from $68 on Thursday.

Analyst Brian Morrison maintained a Hold rating on shares of the Canadian manufacturing company ahead of its fiscal Q4 results on March 5.

"We see few near-term catalysts given the weak y/y Q4/24 outlook, slowing demand in its Industrial segment, and ongoing tariff uncertainty that could have a material financial impact," Morrison said in a note to clients.

"While Linamar's valuation is attractive relative to its average, we see downside risk to the consensus outlook and prefer our Hold recommendation until we have improved visibility upon these headwinds subsiding," the analyst said.
