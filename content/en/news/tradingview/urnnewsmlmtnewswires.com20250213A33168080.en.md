Meta Platforms said Thursday it is launching the Facebook Marketplace Partner Program to open its Facebook Marketplace platform to eligible online classified ad service providers in response to the European Commission's November 2024 ruling that the company was in violation of EU antitrust rules.

The European Commission said on Nov. 13,Â 2024, that it had fined Meta 797.72 million euros ($828.9 million) for tying Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and "imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers."

"This new program will mean that third-party partners (specifically, online classified ad service providers as defined in the European Commission's decision) will be able to list their consumer-to-consumer inventory on Facebook Marketplace," Meta said in a post on its website. "That inventory will appear side by side with other third-party inventory and Facebook user listings, opening up access to a new distribution channel for their platforms and sellers, and a broader set of consumers to tap into."
