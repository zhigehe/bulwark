By Josh Beckerman

AbbVie received Food and Drug Administration approval of Emblaveo, an intravenous antibiotic, for treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections with limited or no treatment options.

The drug, which combines aztreonam and avibactam, was approved in combination with metronidazole.

Emblaveo was jointly developed with Pfizer. AbbVie holds U.S. and Canada commercialization rights, with Pfizer responsible for commercialization in all other areas. Last April, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated urinary tract infections.

"The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacteria has left some patients with little to no treatment options, resulting in extended hospital stays, additional morbidity and death," AbbVie said.

The drug will be available for commercial use in the U.S. in the third quarter.
