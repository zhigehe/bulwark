India's central bank will likely cut rates by 25 bps in April, SMBC economist Ryota Abe says in a note. Estimates point to a continued economic slowdown, and the government and the Reserve Bank of India will likely work together to support the economy with complementary policies, Abe says. The RBI's recent manufacturing sentiment survey showed that 25% of companies surveyed reported shrinking net profit margins for the October-December quarter, up from 19% a year ago. That suggests a persistent manufacturing slowdown and likely contributed to the RBI's lowered GDP growth forecast for this fiscal year, the economist adds. In addition, as inflation stabilizes, real rates will remain high, leaving more room for lowering the nominal policy rate, Abe says. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)
