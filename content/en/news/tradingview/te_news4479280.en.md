The South Korean won weakened toward 1,445 per dollar, reversing gains from the previous session, as investors remained on edge following US President Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on countries taxing US imports.

On Thursday, Trump instructed his economics team to investigate unfair trade practices and devise plans for reciprocal tariffs, with South Korea among its key targets, further pressuring the won, although the tariffs would not be implemented immediately.

In response, South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok stated the government would review non-tariff barriers and vulnerabilities to address the plans, aiming to mitigate potential economic impacts.

Choi also emphasized that despite low tariffs under the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, the government will closely monitor the situation and prepare to negotiate, given its significant US investments.
