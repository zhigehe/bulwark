The European stock markets closed modestly higher in Wednesday trading as The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.09%, Germany's DAX rose 0.48%, the FTSE 100 in London was up 0.34%, France's CAC 40 increased 0.17%, and the Swiss Market Index closed 0.16% higher.

Global supply chains were operating at full capacity in January "with the notable exception of Europe, which remains in a protracted industrial recession," according to the latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index report released Wednesday.

It also said that factories in Germany, France, Italy, and the UK held back on material purchases in January, "implying that Europe's manufacturing recession is set to persist a while longer." The index for Europe declined to -0.61 during the month, from -0.49 in December.

French oil and gas company TotalEnergies said Wednesday it signed a 10-year agreement to supply 400,000 tons of liquefied natural gas to India's state-owned oil and gas company Gujarat State Petroleum starting next year.
