Sichuan Kelun-Biotech Biopharmaceutical will present the results of its phase 1/2 study of its sacituzumab tirumotecan drug during a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in San Francisco from Thursday to Saturday.

The drug is indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have shown progress on or after prior anti-cancer treatments, according to a Tuesday filing with the Hong Kong exchange.

The drug has previous indications for advanced solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and gynecological tumors, among others, the filing said.
