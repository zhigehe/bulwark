Copper Nickel Cobalt Zones Show Improving Grade AtDepth

February 12, 2025 – TheNewswire - Miramichi, New Brunswick ‐ SLAMExploration Ltd. (“SLAM” or the “Company”) (TSXV-SXL)is pleased to announce itdrilled a 117.6 meter core interval grading 0.54% copper equivalentincluding a new high grade zone of 17.1 meters grading 1.1% copperequivalent in hole GW24-15 in the Logan Zone. GW24-15 is 450 metersnorth of a 64.9 meter interval grading 2.00% copper equivalent drilledin hole GW24-02.

The Farquharson, Logan and Granges zones are hostedwithin sill-like gabbro units with potential for ovoid bodies andother structural traps that could host large accumulations of copper,nickel and cobalt mineralization located on Slam’s wholly ownedGoodwin claims in the mineral-rich Bathurst Mining Camp of NewBrunswick. All 3 zones are all open along strike as well as at depthand represent high priority targets for the 2025 drilling campaign.

The new high grade zone in GW24-15 is the deepestintercept to date on the Logan zone. It is 1,000 meters northwest of a60.6 meter interval grading 1.11% copper equivalent drilled in holeGW24-03 on the Farquharson zone. This is the deepest and highest gradeintercept on the Farquharson zone. High grade mineralization occursnear surface in the Granges zone. All 3 zones are open along strikeand at depth.

The grade of the Logan copper nickel zone is increasingat depth as shown in 3 holes drilled on one line and portrayed on thecross section below:

The new high grade zone at a depth of 200 meters inhole GW24-15 is a repeat of a similar copper nickel zone at the samedepth in GW24-14. It is a 50 meter step-out to the southeast ofGW24-14 as shown on the drill plan map below. The Logan zone is openat depth and along strike.

The Logan Zone:The Logan copper nickel zone is located 450 meters north of theGranges zone where Slam previously reported2.00% copper equivalent over 64.9 meters in hole GW24-02. Slam also reported 1.49% copperequivalent over 47.00 meters in hole GW24-03 on the Farquharsoncopper nickel cobalt zone 1,000 meters southeast of theLogan zone. Selectedresults are tabled below:

| Zone | Hole ID | From | To (m) | Length | Copper% | Nickel% | Cobalt% | Cu-Eq% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logan | GW2415 | 98.00 | 215.60 | 117.60 | 0.24 | 0.15 | 0.03 | 0.54 |
| Logan | GW2415 | 198.50 | 215.60 | 17.10 | 0.48 | 0.30 | 0.05 | 1.10 |
| Logan | GW2415 | 205.00 | 206.00 | 1.00 | 2.66 | 0.34 | 0.06 | 3.35 |
| Logan | GW2414 | 159.50 | 209.00 | 49.50 | 0.27 | 0.21 | 0.04 | 0.69 |
| Logan | GW2414 | 196.86 | 209.00 | 12.14 | 0.66 | 0.43 | 0.07 | 1.52 |
| Logan | GW2414 | 202.37 | 206.40 | 4.03 | 1.04 | 0.62 | 0.10 | 2.27 |
| Farquharson | GW24-03 | 72.90 | 133.50 | 60.60 | 0.39 | 0.35 | 0.04 | 1.11 |
| Granges | GW24-02 | 23.60 | 88.50 | 64.90 | 0.73 | 0.64 | 0.05 | 2.00 |

The Farquharson Zone: All5 holes on the Farquharson zone intersected copper nickel mineralization over core intervalsranging from 46 meters to 75 meters and grades ranging from 0.75% to1.26% copper equivalent as previously reported. These holes define theFarquharson zone over a strike length of 140meters and to a downhole depth of 130 meters. As in the Loganzone, the grade of the Farquharson zone isincreasing with depth. The best Farquharson interval was drilled inGW24-03 as shown on the cross section below:

The Goodwin project also includes the Bruce coppernickel occurrence acquired in 2024 and a block of claims recentlystaked to cover a large area of aeromagnetic anomalies associated withgabbro intrusive bodies. The Goodwin project now covers 11,450hectares of prospective ground extending from the Bruce occurrence for25 kilometers westward to a copper nickel float occurrence located ona prospector’s claim.

PDAC Investors Exchange: For more information about the Goodwin Copper Nickel Projectand about Slam, visit Booth3228 from Sunday March 2 to Wednesday March 5,2025 at the Metro Toronto Convention Center.

Canada’s Atlantic EdgeSession: Mike Taylor will participate in thissession with a presentation titled “The Goodwin Copper NickelProject” at 11:55 AM on Tuesday, March 4, 2025at Ballroom A of the Intercontinental Hotel in downtownToronto.

QA-QC Procedures: Core was collected from the drill in trays and delivered toa secure logging facility in Bathurst, New Brunswick. After logging,samples were sawn using a diamond blade. Sawn half-core samples werenumbered, collected in bags, tagged and delivered to ActivationLaboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) in Fredericton for multi-element analysisusing their methods assay method AR-ICP. Samples that were over-limit(above 1%) for the ICP method were re-analyzed using method8-AR.

About SLAM Exploration Ltd:SLAM Exploration Ltd. is a public resourcecompany with a large portfolio of mineral claim holdings in themineral-rich province of New Brunswick. The Company has reported significantcopper, nickel and cobalt intercepts from 15 diamond drill holescompleted on the Goodwin copper nickel project in the Bathurst MiningCamp (“BMC”) of New Brunswick.
