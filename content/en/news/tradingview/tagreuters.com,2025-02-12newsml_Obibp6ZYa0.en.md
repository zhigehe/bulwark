Aker Carbon Capture ASA (ACC), an Aker Horizons portfolio company, todayannounced that the Board of Directors of ACC has proposed an extraordinarycashdividend of NOK 3.5 billion, of which Aker Horizons is expected to receiveapproximately NOK 1.5 billion based on its 43.27% ownership in ACC.

In June 2024, ACC and SLB announced the completion of a transaction combiningtheir carbon capture businesses in a joint venture (JV), since renamed SLBCapturi. ACC retains a 20% ownership stake in the JV and SLB holds theremaining80%. ACC booked a gain on the sale of NOK 4.9 billion in its consolidatedaccounts.

Going forward, ACC will, through its ownership in SLB Capturi, continue tosupport the development of the carbon capture business of SLB Capturi. Thecashposition remaining in ACC following the proposed dividend distribution willenable ACC to retain a sufficiently robust balance sheet to fulfill its roleandresponsibilities as a minority owner of SLB Capturi, and will back ACC'sremaining pro-rata guarantee exposure for projects awarded prior to theformation of the JV.

ACC's proposed cash dividend is among other things subject to approval by anextraordinary general meeting in ACC, expected to be held on or about 7 March2025. Please refer to ACC's announcement for more details.
