A ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia war could pave the way for a reconstruction project akin to the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild parts of Europe after the World War II or a common bond plan similar to the EU Recovery Fund launched after the Covid pandemic, UBS analysts say. The potential cost of rebuilding Ukraine has been estimated at $0.6 trillion, they note. A ceasefire would also lower energy prices, especially if the deal allows Russian gas to flow again, they add. Falling gas helps lower the price of electricity, which has been abnormally high relative to the U.S., the analysts say. UBS considers a ceasefire quite likely because of increasing signs of fatigue from Ukraine, rising distress in the Russian economy, and the pressure to reach a deal exerted by U.S. President Trump.
