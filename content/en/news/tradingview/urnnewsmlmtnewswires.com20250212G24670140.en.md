Nippon Denko raised its year-end dividend forecast to 7 yen per share, bringing the total annual dividend for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, to 11 yen per share, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The revision aligns with the company's shareholder return policy, which targets a payout ratio of about 40% based on underlying profit.

Nippon Denko calculated underlying profit for 2024 at 3.64 billion yen, or 26.5 yen per share. The updated dividend plan will be presented at the general shareholders' meeting on March 27.

The company previously forecast a 6 yen year-end dividend and a 10-yen annual payout. It paid 4 yen per share at the half-year mark.
