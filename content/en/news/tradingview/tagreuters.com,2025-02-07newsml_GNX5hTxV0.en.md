Lake City, Colo., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In a free webinar on February 19, Green Builder Media CEO Sara Gutterman will share detailed insights from COGNITION Smart Data, offering actionable advice on how to meet the preferences of Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen Zs—and prepare for the upcoming demands of Gen Alpha.

The webinar will offer hot-off-the-press market intelligence about the changing attitudes and expectations for each generation. Join the webinar and get the details, trends, and ideas for attracting buyers from all demographics:

* As **Boomers** transition into retirement, their housing preferences focus on comfort, accessibility, durability, and cost savings.
* Considered the "sandwich" generation, many **Gen Xers** are taking care of parents, children, and in some cases, grandchildren. Balancing careers, family, and the realities of their own aging, these individuals want homes that are practical yet offer good value for their investment.
* **Millennials**, the largest home-buying generation, are demanding a blend of affordability, sustainability, and connectivity. Recognizing that first cost isn’t full cost, these individuals are willing to pay more upfront for products like energy efficient windows, insulation, appliances, and electric systems that will reduce both monthly bills and environmental impact.
* As **Gen Z** enters the housing market, their priorities reflect their upbringing in a tech-dominated, climate-conscious world. In nascent stages of their careers, these individuals are extremely cost-conscious, but sustainability remains top of mind, with nearly 70 percent saying that they are deeply worried about climate change. They’re seeking small, affordable, minimalistic housing with multi-functional spaces and shared amenities.
* While **Gen Alphas** (born 2013 and beyond) are still young, their preferences are beginning to form. As they see the world burn, parch, flood, and blow down around them, expect them to force the housing industry to rethink resiliency and sustainability.

In addition to generational differences, this webinar will explore how essential topics like resiliency, insurance, AI, remote work, mental health concerns, affordability, multifamily living, and creative co-ownership solutions are transforming the housing market.

If you want to future-proof your business and thrive in today’s evolving market, this webinar is a must-attend event. Register now to stay ahead of generational trends and ensure your products and designs resonate with the buyers of today and tomorrow!
