Barclays said with its 2024 results on Thursday that it is facing a new money-laundering probe from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority while also disclosing a provision of 90 million pounds sterling for a separate FCA probe.

The new civil enforcement investigation from the FCA is mainly focused on the historical oversight and management of certain customers with increased risk. The British bank said it is cooperating with the regulator for the investigation.

The provision of 90 million pounds is related to the FCA's ongoing review of historical motor finance commission arrangements. Barclays noted that it stopped operating in the motor finance market in 2019 but its previous operations may be covered by potential a redress scheme by the FCA.

The provision is based on currently available information and is subject to uncertainty as the FCA's review remains ongoing.
