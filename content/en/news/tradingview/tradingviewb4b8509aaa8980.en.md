CoreCivic, Inc., a diversified government-solutions company, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company, which provides corrections and detention management, residential reentry services, and government real estate solutions, reported strong financial performance driven by higher occupancy rates and effective cost management.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, CoreCivic reported total revenue of $479.3 million, with a net income of $19.3 million. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $0.17, while adjusted diluted EPS was $0.16. The company also reported normalized funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share of $0.39 and adjusted EBITDA of $74.2 million.

For the full year 2024, total revenue reached $2.0 billion, with a net income of $68.9 million. Diluted EPS for the year was $0.62, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.81. Normalized FFO per diluted share was $1.70, and adjusted EBITDA was $330.8 million.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

CoreCivic experienced increased occupancy rates, reaching 75.5% of available capacity, the highest level since the first quarter of 2020. This increase in occupancy, combined with cost management initiatives, contributed to the company's strong financial performance. Despite the termination of a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the South Texas Family Residential Center and the expiration of a lease with the state of California at the California City Correctional Center, the company managed to achieve positive results.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

CoreCivic resumed its share repurchase program, buying back 4.4 million shares of common stock in 2024 at an aggregate purchase price of $68.5 million. The company has $168.9 million remaining under the share repurchase program. Additionally, CoreCivic announced a new management contract with the state of Montana to care for additional inmates, with 240 inmates arriving at its facilities in January 2025.

**Management's Perspective**

Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic’s Chief Executive Officer, expressed optimism about the company's future, anticipating accelerated demand from federal, state, and local government partners. He highlighted the company's strong balance sheet and readiness to meet growing demand. Patrick Swindle, CoreCivic’s President and Chief Operating Officer, noted that the fourth quarter financial results exceeded internal forecasts and analyst estimates, attributing the success to cost management initiatives and increased occupancy.

**Future Outlook**

CoreCivic provided financial guidance for the full year 2025, projecting net income between $53.5 million and $67.5 million, diluted EPS between $0.48 and $0.61, FFO per diluted share between $1.37 and $1.50, and EBITDA between $281.0 million and $293.0 million. The guidance reflects a reduction in facility net operating income due to the termination of the ICE contract at the South Texas Family Residential Center and the lease expiration with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at the California City Correctional Center.
