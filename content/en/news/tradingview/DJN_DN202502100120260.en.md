WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday announced 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S., reinstating global duties without exceptions for allies such as Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea that were relaxed by the Biden administration.

"It's a big deal. This is the beginning of making America rich again," Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday, as he signed dual executive orders for steel and aluminum tariffs. "No exceptions, no nothing," Trump added.

The steel and aluminum tariffs are just the latest in a litany of tariff threats and impositions from Trump in the first weeks of his second term. Trump has so far imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods — in addition to previous tariffs — and threatened 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Colombia, before reaching deals with their governments.

Updates to follow as news develops.
