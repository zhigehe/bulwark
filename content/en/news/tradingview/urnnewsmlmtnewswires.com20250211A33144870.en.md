Siebert Financial said Tuesday it has launched the Siebert Investment Banking unit led by Kimberly Boulmetis and Ajay Asija as co-heads.

The company said the new unit, focused on middle-market clients, will offer services in capital markets, mergers and acquisitions, and financial advisory, initially targeting financial services, FinTech, and specialty finance sectors, with plans to expand into blockchain and digital assets.

Siebert said Asija was most recently chief financial officer at BM Technologies, while Boulmetis led US Financial Institutions for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's debt capital markets group.
