Brent crude oil futures advanced 1.6% to settle near $75.9 per barrel on Monday, as supply concerns mounted following new US sanctions, even as investors largely brushed off President Donald Trump’s latest threat.

The sanctions targeted individuals and tankers involved in transporting Iranian crude to China, increasing pressure on Tehran.

However, the rally was capped by lingering fears over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s recent tariffs on steel and aluminum, which could disrupt the US energy sector—particularly oil drillers reliant on specialty steel unavailable domestically.

Additionally, China’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods took effect today, though their impact is expected to be limited due to China’s relatively small imports of US energy products.

While supply constraints are providing upward momentum for oil prices, market sentiment remains cautious amid escalating trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty.
