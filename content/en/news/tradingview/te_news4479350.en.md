New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.6% to 12,989 on Friday, tracking Wall Street's gains after US President Donald Trump delayed implementing reciprocal tariffs.

Sentiment also improved as New Zealand’s factory activity expanded in January for the first time in nearly two years, marking its strongest growth since September 2022.

Meanwhile, food inflation hit a one-year high of 2.3%.

Traders now await the RBNZ’s policy meeting next week, where a 50 bps rate cut to 3.75% is expected.

Among key stocks, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare led gains, rising 1.9%, while electronic technology and non-energy minerals also advanced.

On the downside, Manawa Energy was ordered by the High Court to forgo formal service of its amended scheme of arrangement with Contact Energy, sending its shares down nearly 2%.

Commercial services stocks also slipped 0.2%.

For the week, the index gained 0.7%, its first rise in four weeks.
