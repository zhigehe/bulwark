US equity futures were lower Tuesday as traders looked ahead to key inflation reports due later in the week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%, S&P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq futures were down 0.4%.

Investors are keeping an eye on the consumer price index report scheduled for release on Wednesday, which will be followed by the producer price index on Thursday.

Oil prices were higher, with front-month global benchmark North Sea Brent crude up 1.5% at $76.97 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude up 1.4% at $73.33 per barrel.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for the first day of his semiannual monetary policy testimony.
