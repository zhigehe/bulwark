Australia's Star Entertainment Group said on Monday it has received offers from its Hong Kong investors to acquire a 50% interest in the embattled casino operator's Destination Brisbane Joint Venture.

Destination Brisbane Consortium is a joint venture between Star Entertainment and its Hong Kong partners, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises and Far East Consortium. It operates Queen's Wharf Brisbane which includes luxury hotels and restaurants, among other amenities.

The casino operator said none of the proposals have provided "sufficient value" for the company and that it continues to engage with the both the parties to negotiate the proposals.

The announcement came as response to recent media report relating to the proposed offers.

Last month , Star said it would divest its Star Sydney Event Centre assets to theater owner and operator Foundation Theatres for A$60 million ($37.5 million) as it undergoes a cash and liquidity crunch.

Since 2021, Star has been embroiled in a slew of government probes over possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws at its Sydney and Queensland casinos.
