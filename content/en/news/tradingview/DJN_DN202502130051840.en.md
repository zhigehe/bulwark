   PR Newswire   
   
   
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 12, 2025   
   
   
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Karman Holdings   
Inc. ("Karman" or the "Company"), a company specializing in the upfront   
design, testing, manufacturing, and sale of mission-critical systems for   
existing and emerging missile and defense, and space programs, today   
announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 23,000,000   
shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per   
share (the "Common Stock"). The offering consists of 8,421,053 shares of   
Common Stock offered by Karman and 14,578,947 shares of Common Stock to   
be sold by certain of Karman's existing stockholders (the "Selling   
Stockholders"). Karman will not receive any proceeds from the sale of   
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. The shares of Karman's Common   
Stock are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock   
Exchange under the ticker symbol "KRMN" on February 13, 2025, and the   
offering is expected to close on February 14, 2025, subject to customary   
closing conditions.   
   
   
   
   In addition, certain of the Selling Stockholders have granted the   
underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,450,000   
shares (solely to cover over allotments, if any) of its Common Stock at   
the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and   
commissions. Karman will not receive any proceeds from the sale of   
shares by the selling stockholder if the underwriters exercise their   
option to purchase additional shares of Common Stock.   
   
   
   Karman currently intends to use the net proceeds it receives from this   
offering, together with its existing cash, cash equivalents and   
short-term investments, for general corporate purposes, including   
additional development efforts, working capital and operating expenses.   
   
   
   Citigroup and Evercore ISI are acting as book-running managers for the   
proposed offering and as representatives of the underwriters for the   
proposed offering. RBC Capital Markets and William Blair are acting as   
joint bookrunners for the proposed offering. Baird is acting as   
co-manager for the proposed offering.   
   
   
   A registration statement relating to the Common Stock was declared   
effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12,   
2025. The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. Copies
