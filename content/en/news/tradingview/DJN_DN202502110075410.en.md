Merck's advanced takeover talks with the U.S. biotech Springworks Therapeutics will likely have a minimal impact on earnings estimates, analysts at DZ Bank say in a note. Springworks fits into the German company's strategy of focusing on drugs below the blockbuster threshold, they say. However, both companies are too small to predict a guaranteed success of the merger. In principle, a strengthening of the Merck Healthcare division is desirable, DZ Bank analysts say. Merck has long stated its desire for larger acquisitions in the healthcare and life science space, which should be possible even after this transaction, according to the DZ Bank. Shares are flat at 134.95 euros. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)
