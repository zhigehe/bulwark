Bawan (SASE:1302) said Thursday it satisfied the legal requirements for its initial acquisition of an 80% stake in Petronash Holding.

The majority stake transaction is part of the Saudi Arabian industrial group's planned $175 million takeover of Petronash.

Under the companies' sale and purchase agreement, Bawan will acquire the remaining 20% stake after Petronash publishes its financial statements for 2027 or 2028.
