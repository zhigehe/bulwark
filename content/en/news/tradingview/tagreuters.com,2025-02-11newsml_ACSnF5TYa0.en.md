* BV500 reaches second milestone, with the advancement of multiple broadly profiled and highly potent oral Lead candidates with demonstrated broad-spectrum in vitro and in vivo efficacy against non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
* Continued strategic support from LifeArc through the CF AMR Syndicate Collaborative Discovery Programme (CDP), accelerating the development of novel therapies for difficult-to-treat NTM lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.
* Leveraging its proprietary Ansamycin Chemistry platform, BioVersys' BV500 molecules are designed to overcome resistance and address highly drug-resistant NTM infections.

**BASEL, CH / ACCESS Newswire / February 11, 2025 /** **BioVersys AG** , a multi-asset, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on research and development of novel antibacterial products for serious life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, announced today that its BV500 NTM program has reached its second milestone, " identification of up to 5 Optimized Lead compounds", under the CF AMR Syndicate Collaborative Discovery Programme (CDP) agreement. Supported by LifeArc funding, BioVersys is developing novel small molecules targeting difficult to treat non-tuberculous mycobacteria lung disease (NTM-LD) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

The company's BV500 NTM program is derived from its proprietary Ansamycin Chemistry platform from which the research team has identified and is developing several advanced, highly potent ansamycin oral Lead candidates, with broad-spectrum *in vitro* and *in vivo* anti-NTM activity, and which are devoid of cross-resistance with other therapeutic classes.

**Dr. Nawaz Khan, Head of Research at BioVersys:** "We are very pleased with the progress of our BV500 program, the fourth of a series of successful pipeline programs, targeting high unmet medical need in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Together with our collaboration partners from the CF AMR Syndicate (LifeArc, Medicines Discovery Catapult and Cystic Fibrosis Trust), we continue to show how successful partnerships can be developed to address patients suffering with difficult to treat NTM-LD, through synergizing a broad range of complementary expertise."

Dr. Catherine Kettleborough, Head of Chronic Respiratory Infection Translational Challenge at LifeArc: "Addressing the urgent challenge of NTM lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis requires innovation and collaboration. The progress of the BV500 program demonstrates the impact of bringing together scientific expertise to accelerate the development of much-needed treatments. We are proud to support BioVersys in advancing this promising research, with the shared goal of improving outcomes for patients."

**About non-tuberculous mycobacteria**

Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental bacteria whose common clinical manifestation is pulmonary (lung) disease (NTM-PD or NTM-LD) caused most frequently by *Mycobacterium avium complex* (MAC) and *Mycobacterium abscessus* subspecies (MAB). [1] NTM-PD affects approximately 250,000 people per year, predominantly in North America and Asia. 3 Treatment of NTM infections is challenging due to variable intrinsic bacterial susceptibility, acquired resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents, length of therapy (at least 12 months) and adverse effects associated with current treatment options. Macrolide-based, triple drug regimens, plus aminoglycosides for chronic/relapsing infections [2] are considered only moderately effective for treating MAC, whereas no therapy of predictable efficacy exists for the treatment of MAB, a pathogen associated with up to 50% mortality. [3] People with preexisting conditions, including cystic fibrosis (CF), other lung diseases and immune-compromised patients are more easily colonised. The incidence of NTM infections among people living with CF has increased from 3.3% to 22.6%, with MAB becoming a more prominent pathogen. [4]

**About the CF AMR Syndicate**

The CF AMR Syndicate is a cross-sector initiative that brings together leading experts in CF and AMR from industry, academia and the clinic with people with CF. The Syndicate's aim is to accelerate the translation of CF antimicrobials and diagnostics to the clinic and bring new and effective treatment options to people with CF. The Syndicate was established in 2019 and is jointly managed by Medicines Discovery Catapult, Cystic Fibrosis Trust and LifeArc. www.cfamr.org.uk

**About LifeArc**

LifeArc is a self-funded, non-profit medical research organisation. We take scientific ideas out of the lab and help to turn them into medical breakthroughs that can be life-changing for patients. We have been doing this for more than 25 years and our work has resulted in five licensed medicines and a diagnostic for antibiotic resistance. Our teams are experts in drug and diagnostics discovery, technology transfer, and intellectual property. Our work is in translational science - bridging the gap between academic research and clinical development, providing funding, research and expert knowledge, all with a clear and unwavering commitment to having a positive impact on patient lives.

LifeArc is a charity registered in England and Wales under 1015243 and in Scotland under SC037861.

**About Medicines Discovery Catapult**

Medicines Discovery Catapult (MDC) is a national Life Sciences service dedicated to turning drug discovery into commercial breakthroughs. At the frontier of drug discovery, MDC works with entrepreneurial scientists to make every move count. It validates their ideas, de-risks investments, and feeds insights back into the sector to drive productivity and impact.

MDC creates momentum through its unique blend of discovery expertise, technology, insights, and sector-leading partnerships. Where there is unmet patient need, MDC stimulates innovation through its National Programmes. MDC has helped over 300 companies raise more than £1.2bn of R&D investment.
