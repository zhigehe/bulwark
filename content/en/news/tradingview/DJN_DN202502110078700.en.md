Base metal prices fall, with LME three-month copper down 1% at $9,358 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum down 0.85% at $2,638.50 a ton. Metal prices sit higher on-week however, after President Trump formalized 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports, removing prior exemptions, Morgan Stanley analysts say in a note. The tariffs will likely raise costs for U.S. aluminum users, predominantly via a higher Midwest premium, which has already jumped from 16% of the LME price in November to 29%--and could rise higher, Morgan Stanley analysts write. The copper spread has also widened, with U.S. commodities exchange Comex now trading at an 11% premium to the LME, from a normal level of 0%-2%. This suggests the market is anticipating future tariffs on copper, Morgan Stanley adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)
