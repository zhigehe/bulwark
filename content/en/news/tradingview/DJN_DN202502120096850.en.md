Average daily production of ethanol in the U.S. continues to fluctuate, this week sinking after coming close to an all-time record high the previous week.

The Energy Information Administration said in its latest Weekly Petroleum Status report on Wednesday that U.S. ethanol through the week ended Feb. 7 averaged production of 1.082 million barrels a day. That's off 30,000 barrels a day from last week's production figure, falling within the estimates of analysts surveyed by Dow Jones this week.

Inventories also fell back, dropping back below the 26 million barrel mark to 25.69 million barrels. That's on the low end of analyst expectations for the week.

Most-active corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade are up 0.6% to nearly $4.87 a bushel on Wednesday, coming back from selling seen overnight and a generally sour sentiment after February's Wasde report from the Department of Agriculture contained no revisions to domestic corn production estimates.
