**(07:21 GMT)** Birkin Bag Maker Hermes Posts Higher Revenue on Strong Americas Performance

By Andrea Figueras

French luxury group Hermes reported higher sales for the final quarter of 2024 after a strong performance in the Americas, adding to signs of a potential rebound in demand for luxury goods.

The maker of the Birkin bag reported on Friday revenue of 3.96 billion euros ($4.15 billion) for the fourth quarter, up nearly 18% at constant exchange rates compared with the prior-year period.

The result compares with analysts' expectations of 3.73 billion euros, according to a Visible Alpha poll of estimates.

For the year as a whole, the group made earnings before interest and taxes of 6.15 billion euros compared with 5.65 billion euros previously. Net profit jumped to 4.60 billion euros, surpassing analysts' prospects of 4.51 billion euros.

The company confirmed its expectations for the medium-term of revenue growth at constant exchange rates, but cautioned on global economic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties.
