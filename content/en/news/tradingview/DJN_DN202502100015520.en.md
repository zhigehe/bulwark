WH Ireland said it agreed to allow Verso Wealth Management to market its services to certain clients of its loss-making Henley office.

The wealth manager said Monday that under the agreement, it would receive cash payments linked to any revenue generated from its clients until June 20, with a maximum of 500,000 pounds, equivalent to $620,150.

The portfolio represents around 152 million pounds of its assets under management, WH Ireland said.
