The S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.3% to around 8,560 on Thursday, edging closer to new all-time highs, as mining stocks drove the gains amid stronger commodity prices.

Investors also digested a range of mostly positive earnings results from major companies for the first half of the year.

The local market shrugged off the hotter-than-expected US consumer inflation data, which reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged.

The mining sector saw significant gains, with BHP Group rising 1.7%, Fortescue up 1.1%, Pilbara Minerals gaining 4.2%, and Mineral Resources jumping 6.4%.

Sigma Healthcare surged 3.6% after announcing its merger with Chemist Warehouse.

However, Treasury Wine Estate and IAG faced declines, falling 3.8% and 9.4%, respectively, due to disappointing half-year results.
