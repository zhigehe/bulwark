South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service unveiled its strategic goals for 2025, focusing on stability, trust, growth, and innovation.

The financial watchdog plans to enhance financial system stability by supervising real estate finance and addressing potential risks while boosting loss-absorbing capacities. Efforts will also target combating unfair practices, boosting internal controls, and protecting consumers, according to an FSS release on Monday.

The FSS aims to foster a "virtuous" financial ecosystem, support capital market advancements, and safeguard vulnerable groups. It will also promote AI-driven digital innovation and establish a secure digital environment while continuing internal innovations to deliver advanced supervisory services.
