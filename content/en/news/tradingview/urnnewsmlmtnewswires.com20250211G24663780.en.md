Barclays expects Spanish drugmaker Grifols to report strong full-year 2024 results amid a recovering plasma market as indicated by its peer CSL Behring's solid fiscal first-half results.

CSL Behring's $5.74 billion in sales for the first half exceeded consensus estimates, with the result boosted by robust demand for immunoglobulin albumin, according to a Monday note. Barclays said CSL Behring's results confirm ongoing recovery in the plasma market, which analysts see as a positive sign for Grifols' outlook.

"Overall, we see this positive print from CSL Behring as supportive of our above consensus expectations for GRF FY24 results and FY25 outlook," analysts said. "We retain our above consensus forecasts into FY24 results, predicting c10.4% CER FY24 GRF Biopharma growth (vs guidance 8-10% and Bloomberg consensus 9.8%) and our above consensus adjusted EBITDA margin (26.8% vs >25.5%)."

Grifols is set to release its 2024 results on Feb. 26. Barclays rates the company at overweight, with a price target of 13 euros.
