The repricing of the Federal Reserve cycle after the strong United States jobs data has seen EUR:USD two-year swap rate differentials widen beyond 190bps, said ING.

The bank expects those differentials to stay near 200bps for most of the year and to keep under pressure.

Friday's release of the European Central Bank's staff paper on the neutral interest rate had little impact on the pricing of the ECB cycle, stated ING.

The threat of U.S. tariffs coming to Europe this week has seen drop close to 1.03 again, wrote the bank in a note. A move back to 1.0225 is possible if there are 'reciprocal' tariffs from the European Union or some of the major European countries not in the bloc.

Wednesday's U.S. consumer price index release is another negative event risk for , pointed out ING. If it can survive the tariff risk and the CPI, the run-up into Friday could look a little better for as investors turn their attention to the Munich security conference. Here the bank is expecting to hear more about the U.S. proposed ceasefire deal in the Russia-Ukraine war.

A surprise deal would certainly be a positive for the European currency.

The data calendar is light on Monday — just ECB President Christine Lagarde in parliament at 3 p.m. CET.

is offered again early Monday as financial markets are dominated once more by the tariff story, added the bank. Markets expect the EU to have more to lose than the United Kingom on tariffs.

ING cannot rule out another drop in to the 0.8250 area should tariffs hit the EU in the early part of this week. However, Tuesday could see the focus flip back to the Bank of England easing cycle. Former arch-hawk — potentially now arch-dove — Catherine Mann delivers a speech on the U.K. outlook.

Understanding why she voted for a 50bps rate cut last week could shed light on whether others will want to follow suit. A soft Q4 U.K. gross domestic product figure out on Thursday could also add to a dovish narrative.

should be the focus for any sterling downside, however. ING favors heading down towards the lower end of a 1.2250-1.2500 trading range.
