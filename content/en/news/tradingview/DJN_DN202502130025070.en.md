By Anthony O. Goriainoff

Coca-Cola HBC said its net profit rose last year, beating consensus as volumes grew, but also flagged foreign-exchange headwinds in the year ahead.

The bottler for Coca-Cola Co.--listed in both London and Athens--on Thursday said it expects the effect of translational foreign exchange on its comparable operating profit to be a 15 million euros to 35 million euros ($15.6 million-$36.3 million) headwind.

The company reported 2024 net profit of 820.6 million euros compared with 636.5 million euros in 2023. Company-compiled net profit consensus was 812.3 million euros.

Revenue was 10.75 billion euros, compared with 10.18 billion euros the previous year.

Net sales revenue rose to 10.75 billion euros from 10.18 billion euros over the period. Consensus anticipated a result of 10.7 billion euros.

Net sales revenue per unit case was up 2.7% at 3.69 euros. Volumes grew to 2.91 billion cases from 2.835 billion cases.

The Switzerland-based group said its comparable earnings before interest and taxes--or operating profit--came in at 1.19 billion euros, compared with 1.08 billion. EBIT consensus was 1.18 billion euros.

The board declared a dividend payout of 1.03 euro cents a share, compared with 93 euro cents.

For 2025, the company sees organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, and organic EBIT growth in a 7% to 11% range.
