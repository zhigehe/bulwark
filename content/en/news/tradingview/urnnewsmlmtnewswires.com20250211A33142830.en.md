Magna said on Tuesday that the auto supplier expanded its partnership with automaker Mercedes-Benz through development and engineering services up to the production of the all-new electric model of Mercedes-Benz's iconic off-roader.

According to Magna, its eDS Duo electric drive system marked a new chapter in the partnership, providing advanced electric drive system for leading performance and efficiency. The system offers leading traction and off-road capabilities, including a unique wheel-individual propulsion system that enables features like the "G-Turn," allowing the vehicle to rotate 360 degrees in place.

"Strong partnerships with our customers are essential for driving innovation and advancing the automotive industry," said Eric Wilds, Magna's chief strategy and commercial officer. "Our continued partnership with Mercedes-Benz exemplifies how working together can lead to groundbreaking solutions and mutual success."

Magna noted that its long-term partnership with Mercedes-Benz includes the production of more than 500,000 iconic off-roaders at Magna's Graz, Austria facility since 1979.

Magna's share price gained 1.1% on Monday to $55.73 on the TSX.
