PHINIA Inc., a leading provider of advanced fuel injection systems and aftermarket solutions, has released its annual Form 10-K report, detailing the company's financial and operational performance for the fiscal year. The report provides insights into PHINIA's strategic initiatives, business highlights, and the challenges and risks faced by the company as it navigates a competitive global market.

**Financial Highlights**

* **Net sales**: $3,403 million, a decrease of $97 million or 3% from the previous year, primarily due to unfavorable volume and net new business, and the end of certain contract manufacturing agreements.
* **Gross profit**: $756 million, representing a gross margin of 22.2%, an increase from 20.7% in the previous year, driven by lower supplier costs and favorable volume in the Aftermarket segment.
* **Operating income**: $259 million, an increase from $241 million in the previous year, reflecting improved gross profit and lower other operating expenses.
* **Net earnings**: $79 million, a decrease from $102 million in the previous year, impacted by higher interest expenses due to the issuance of debt in connection with the Spin-Off.
* **Earnings per share — diluted**: $1.76, down from $2.17 in the previous year, reflecting the decrease in net earnings.

**Business Highlights**

* **Revenue Segments**: PHINIA Inc. reports its results under two segments: Fuel Systems and Aftermarket. The Fuel Systems segment focuses on advanced fuel injection systems and related components, while the Aftermarket segment provides products and solutions for independent aftermarket customers and original equipment service (OES) customers.
* **Geographical Performance**: In 2024, approximately 37% of PHINIA's net sales were generated in the United States, with the remaining 63% coming from international markets. The company experienced lower commercial vehicle sales in Europe and China within the Fuel Systems segment, but saw favorable volume in Europe within the Aftermarket segment.
* **Future Outlook**: PHINIA expects challenges in earnings and cash generation in 2025 due to foreign currency impacts and a softening of the original equipment markets. However, the company anticipates strong growth in its Aftermarket segment to offset these challenges. PHINIA is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy, with a focus on market share expansion in the commercial vehicle market and growth in hybrid and plug-in vehicles.

**Strategic Initiatives**

* **Strategic Initiatives**: PHINIA Inc. has undertaken strategic initiatives to establish itself as a standalone company following its spin-off from BorgWarner Inc. This includes the installation and implementation of information technology infrastructure to support business functions such as accounting, financial reporting, human resources, legal compliance, and manufacturing. The company is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy, focusing on market share expansion in the commercial vehicle market and growth in hybrid and plug-in vehicles.
* **Capital Management**: PHINIA Inc. has engaged in several capital management activities, including the issuance of $525 million in 6.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 and $450 million in 6.625% Senior Notes due 2032. These issuances were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A and B Facilities. The company also declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per share throughout 2024, with an increase to $0.27 per share announced for March 2025. Additionally, PHINIA repurchased $212 million of its own shares in 2024 as part of its capital management strategy.
* **Future Outlook**: Looking ahead, PHINIA Inc. expects to face challenges in earnings and cash generation in 2025 due to foreign currency impacts and a softening of the original equipment markets. However, the company maintains a positive long-term outlook, focusing on strategic investments and product development to drive growth. PHINIA plans to continue its debt reduction strategy and explore opportunities for capital investment, particularly in sustainable growth initiatives and expanding its differentiated offerings in electronics, software, and complete systems.

**Challenges and Risks**

* **Market Risks**: The company is sensitive to global and regional economic conditions, particularly in the vehicle and industrial equipment industries. Economic downturns, inflation, and changes in consumer preferences, especially towards electric vehicles, could adversely impact sales and profitability.
* **Operational Risks**: PHINIA faces challenges related to supply chain disruptions, volatile commodity prices, and the need to continuously innovate to meet regulatory and consumer demands. The company also faces pressure from OEMs to reduce product prices, which could impact margins.
* **Regulatory Risks**: The company is subject to extensive environmental, health, safety, and other regulations. Changes in these regulations, particularly those related to climate change and emissions, could increase operational costs and impact product demand.
* **Emerging Risks**: The ongoing energy transition and the adoption of electrified powertrains pose a risk to PHINIA's traditional combustion-powered product lines. Additionally, cybersecurity threats and the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence technologies present significant risks to the company's IT infrastructure and data security.
* **Management’s Discussion and Analysis**: Management anticipates challenges in 2025 due to foreign currency fluctuations and a softening of the original equipment markets. The company expects a decline in light vehicle volumes and a modest rebound in commercial vehicle volumes. PHINIA is focusing on operational efficiencies and growing its Aftermarket segment to offset these challenges. The company is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its market position and address long-term growth trends, such as the adoption of zero- and lower-carbon fuel solutions.
* **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**: PHINIA is exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect its financial results. The company also faces risks from changes in interest rates and asset returns, which could impact pension funding obligations and overall financial performance.
