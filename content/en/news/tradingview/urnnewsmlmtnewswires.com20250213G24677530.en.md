Banco Santander said its UK business is not for sale, Reuters reported Thursday, citing a spokesperson for the Spanish lender.

The bank made the statement after London's Financial Times reported the same day that it had early-stage talks with NatWest Group in 2024 regarding the potential divestment of its retail business in the UK. The FT report cited people familiar with the matter.
