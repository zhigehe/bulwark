Bitcoin has faced persistent challenges in recent weeks, struggling to maintain a stable upward momentum. After recently slipping below $100,000, the cryptocurrency now hovers around the $95,000 mark, causing uncertainty among investors.

Despite these setbacks, some analysts see signs that the market’s bull cycle may still have room to run. CryptoQuant contributor MAC\_D recently examined the current state of Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization, offering insights into what might lie ahead for the asset.

**Bitcoin Realized Cap as a Bullish Indicator**

According to Mac’s analysis, Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization—calculated by summing the value of each Bitcoin based on its last recorded transaction price—has reached an all-time high, surpassing $857 billion. This increase occurred even as Bitcoin’s price experienced a downturn.

Traditionally, a rising realized cap indicates that coins are being sold by long-term holders and absorbed by new investors. This redistribution cycle often reflects a healthy, ongoing bull market rather than the end of one.

Mac noted that the proportion of long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for more than six months currently stands at 39.74%, compared to 15.66% during the previous market peak. This higher percentage suggests that long-term holders remain active, and the market has yet to reach its zenith.

While the data indicates that the bull cycle continues, external factors such as trade tensions and inflation could still influence short-term corrections. However, Mac believes these macroeconomic elements won’t derail the market’s long-term upward trajectory. The analyst wrote:

The increase in realized market cap and the decrease in long-term holder ratio indicate that the market is still in a bull cycle. However, investors should also consider macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and inflation. While these factors may lead to short-term corrections and periods of price stability, the long-term upward trend is expected to persist.

**Retail Activity Shows Signs of Revival**

In addition to realized cap metrics, other market indicators also suggest potential positive developments. Another CryptoQuant analyst, caueconomy, highlighted retail investor behavior as a key factor to watch.

While retail demand for Bitcoin has been muted over the past month—declining by just 2% compared to a steeper 20% drop in January—there are signs that this normalization period is ending. Historically, increases in retail activity have coincided with improved market sentiment and short-term price rallies.

If retail participation resumes, it could strengthen Bitcoin’s market structure and contribute to a broader recovery. Although Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase has tempered its recent performance, these underlying metrics provide some optimism for investors.

The data suggests that both long-term and retail participants remain engaged, setting the stage for potential growth once the market regains momentum.
