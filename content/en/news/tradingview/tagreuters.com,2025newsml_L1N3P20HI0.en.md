Vietnam's Nghi Son Refining & Petrochemical (NSRP) is offering prompt spot 500ppm sulphur gasoil for sale in a rare move and for the first time since November 2023, a document on the company's website showed, amid limited local demand.

The refiner is seeking to sell 40,000 kilolitres (14,125 metric tons) of the fuel for loading before February 15.

The tender closes on February 13, but no exact validity dates were stated in the document.

Limited domestic demand and ample supplies were key reasons for the refiner seeking sales outlet outside home, two trade sources said.

Most of the local tanks are filled with gasoil now amid slow demand over the earlier holiday season, with a demand pick-up likely only in March or later, one of the sources added.

Earlier in January, Vietnam's Petrolimex sought to buy a total of 57,000 tons of 500ppm and 10ppm sulphur gasoil for mid-February delivery.
