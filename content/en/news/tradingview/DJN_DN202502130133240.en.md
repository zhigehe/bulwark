It's a mixed picture in markets, with investors on alert for further details of President Trump's tariff plans, as they parse more earnings and inflation data.

The White House has said Trump plans to unveil reciprocal tariffs for all trading partners Thursday, ahead of his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India's high tariff rates make it more vulnerable than most to tit-for-tat levies.

In addition, Trump said Wednesday he and President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin talks on a peace deal to settle the Ukraine war, with concessions to Russia. That helped boost European stocks and currencies.

Meantime, another U.S. inflation reading came in stronger than expected. Wholesale prices rose by 0.4% in January, and the December reading was revised up.

Although producer-price inflation stayed hot last month, the categories that matter for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, were much more muted. Economists now think the PCE, which draws on data from both the consumer and producer-price indexes, probably came a bit closer to target last month.

Still, some investors are worried that stubborn price pressures and the Trump administration's aggressive use of tariffs could lead to a meaningful increase in inflation. Traders have pared back their Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations since Wednesday's surprisingly hot consumer-price index.

"The inflation prints are already above trend, and tariffs haven't really ramped up yet," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. "I think the Fed is doing the right thing by being a little bit more cautious around the rate-cutting campaign."

In recent trading:

U.S. stocks rose. All three major indexes gained, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

Benchmark Treasury yields retreated below 4.55%, after jumping in the previous session following the CPI report.

European equities extended recent gains after Trump said Putin had agreed to begin Ukraine peace talks. The STOXX Europe 600 index gained more than 1%.

Benchmark European natural-gas prices dropped. Any moves to ease restrictions on Russian energy producers could weigh on prices.

The WSJ Dollar Index weakened. The euro and the U.K. pound strengthened against the greenback.

Bitcoin prices slipped to around $96,000.

Coming up:

Earnings are due late Thursday from Airbnb, Applied Materials, Coinbase and others.
