SOMERSET, N.J., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cepham, a leader in nutraceutical innovation, has introduced its Life Phases and Stages Blends (LPAS Blends), a new line of scientifically formulated ingredient blends designed to address nutritional needs at critical life milestones. The LPAS Blends offer dietary supplement companies pre-formulated solutions tailored to specific phases of life, from adolescence to adulthood and aging.

For decades, the dietary supplement industry has largely categorized products based on broad age and gender demographics, overlooking the unique physiological and lifestyle shifts that occur at key life stages. Cepham’s LPAS Blends fill this longstanding gap by providing targeted polyherbal compositions designed to support individuals as they navigate distinct health challenges associated with various life developments.

“Health is not static; it evolves as we progress through life’s different stages,” said Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., founder and president of Cepham. “Our LPAS Blends reflect this reality by offering carefully designed formulations that provide precise nutritional and bioactive support tailored to each phase. This is a step forward in the evolution of personalized nutrition.”

Cepham’s approach to LPAS Blends starts with identifying key health concerns tied to specific life phases. Supplement companies can then access pre-developed formulations designed to address these needs, whether it be cognitive support for students, metabolic balance for young professionals, or hormonal health support for women experiencing menopause. Cepham’s scientific process ensures each blend is optimized for bioavailability, absorption, and real-world efficacy.

“By preemptively developing these specialized polyherbal blends, Cepham is meeting the growing demand for personalized supplement solutions,” Swaroop said. “Consumers are looking for products that align with their life circumstances, and supplement brands are seeking reliable, research-backed ingredient solutions. Our LPAS Blends provide a scientifically validated approach to delivering targeted health benefits.”

With the LPAS Blends, Cepham is setting a new industry standard for nutraceuticals, offering companies a customizable framework for product development. As consumer demand shifts toward more personalized and stage-specific supplementation, Cepham continues to lead the way in developing innovative, science-driven solutions that align with the future of health and wellness.
