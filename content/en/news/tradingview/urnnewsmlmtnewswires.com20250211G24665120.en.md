The industrials sector advanced past 1.6% at midday Wednesday. Investors continued to switch to defensive stocks following the imposition of a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports by US President Donald Trump.

Computershare reported Tuesday fiscal first-half earnings of $0.49 per diluted share, up from $0.17 per diluted share a year earlier. Revenue for the six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was $1.5 billion, compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier. Its shares were up past 14% in recent trading on Wednesday.

On the flip side, the information technology sector shed 1.6%. Trading on Wall Street was mixed as the US Federal Reserve Chair said the central bank is in no rush to cut its short-term interest rate again.

Vection Technologies entered into a three-year partnership valued at AU$484,000 to AU$575,000 with Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali.
