Wyndham Hotels & Resorts logged profit and revenue growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties and franchise fees.

The hospitality company on Wednesday posted a profit of $85 million, or $1.08 a share, up from $50 million, or 60 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, earnings per share came in at $1.04. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share.

Revenue rose to $341 million from $321 million a year earlier, missing the $344.1 million expected by Wall Street.

Chief Executive Geoff Ballotti said the company expects to maintain its momentum as it sees improving customer demand across its leisure and infrastructure segments.

For 2025, the company anticipates adjusted earnings of $4.66 to $4.78. Wall Street forecasts full-year adjusted earnings of $4.77.
