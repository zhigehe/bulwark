**MANA Info**

Decentraland is a blockchain platform that combines elements of virtual reality and digital assets. It is a digital space where users interact and participate in content creation.

The mechanism of Decentraland is based on the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) â€” unique assets that represent virtual land parcels called LAND. Each LAND parcel is unique and owned by only one owner, and it can be occupied by various virtual buildings or objects. All decisions regarding the development and management of Decentraland are made through voting by token holders within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

MANA is the native token in the Decentraland ecosystem. The token serves as a means of participating in DAO voting. Therefore, owning MANA tokens provides the opportunity to participate in platform governance and determine its future development. LAND is a non-fungible token representing land parcels owned by community players. Like MANA, it is part of the Decentraland governance protocol and grants voting rights.
