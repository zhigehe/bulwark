US President Donald Trump said he had held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping after being sworn in on Jan. 20 but did not disclose details of their conversation, Reuters reported Monday, citing an interview on Fox News.

"We have a very good personal relationship," Reuters quoted Trump as saying in the interview.

The conversation confirmation came a week after Trump said he was not rushing to speak with Xi to deescalate the trade war between the world's two economic superpowers, the report said.

In early February, Trump imposed a new 10% tariff on Chinese products. In retaliation, Beijing implemented a 10% to 15% additional tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas, and related products from the US.
