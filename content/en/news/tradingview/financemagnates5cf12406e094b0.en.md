"The initial idea was to launch a university to create a four-year Bachelor's degree programme, but that would be very hard," Francesc Riverola told Finance Magnates after launching the International Trading Institute. The institute plans to offer a Master’s degree to traders. Although the institute currently only offers online classes, its ultimate goal is to launch "in-person classes and a four-year Bachelor's degree programme."

"It would be a university 100% for traders and specifically for the trading world," Riverola said.

Riverola, Chairman of the International Trading Institute, is also the founder and President of FXStreet, which funds the institute, although they are separate entities. In addition to Riverola, the institute has two other active executives: Julie Cook, President, and Jasman Mann, Marketing Director. They are now in the process of hiring and aim to have a team of about 10 staff.

"Since the early days at FXStreet, our goal has always been to help traders," said Riverola pointing out the reason behind launching the institute. And one of the things of course is do something in the education field."

"For me, this project of the institute is very special because my father was a professor and one of the founding fathers of a business school in Barcelona. So for me, it's something that I'm very proud of doing and is a way to honor the memory of my father."

**A Master’s Degree in Trading, but for Only 25 Traders**

The Master’s degree course will cover "all the relevant aspects for a trader," including technical analysis, market fundamentals, trading psychology, and even physical wellness. Further, among many other things, the course will cover artificial intelligence in trading to help traders better understand such tools. It will also cover Python coding necessary for trading.

"The idea is to cover everything related to trading," Riverola said. "So, it has to be a long course with the best faculty possible and the best content possible."

The 18-month long course duration is divided into four semesters, alike the course structure of any university. Each semester will have five modules, each carrying 3 credits.

It has also onboarded eleven industry experts as faculty members. "Some of them will be practitioners. They will be in charge of the non-theoretical part of the course, the real stuff, trading," Riverola added. "The official faculty will teach the theory, and the former professionals will teach the practical part of the course."

These faculty members will provide mentorship to the enrolled traders as well. Riverola states mentorship will be provided during the course’s 18-month duration. "If we see a need afterwards to keep the mentorship going, we will do something."

The International Trading Institute will also offer certification to traders.

The institute's website mentions that relevant academic and industry bodies will recognise the degree. Riverola also revealed that the institute is in talks with two universities for certification without disclosing the potential partners. The talks with them are also in the advanced stage and in case of a failure to onboard them as a partner, it has a backup plan "to get someone on board."

"Failure to get a partner to certify our Masters is not an option," he added. "At the end of the day, the more you are willing to concede to the partner, the better chances you have. We are now fighting for a fair deal, but if they would fail, then we would concede more."

However, the selection process is rigorous, as the institute only wants to enrol a maximum of 25 traders on its inaugural course.

"We are looking for traders with two to three years of experience, like people who are already in the market and want to step forward," Riverola said. "Later on, we will see what the market brings to us because you know that sometimes you have an idea of who will be your target, and then the reality is completely different."

As the institute's website highlights, it targets two groups: independent traders who want to advance their trading skills to a higher level and professional aspirants looking to transition into institutional roles.

**"Master's Degrees Require an Undergraduate Degree"**

The €28,000 price tag for the course will also filter out many applicants. "Initially, the target is traders who want to do something more than just trade their own account, or they want to master their own account," continued Riverola. "It's more aimed at traders who either want to become professionals on the institutional side or do more on the retail side, managing other people's money or entering any company where trading is involved, like hedge funds or prop firms."

Furthermore, the minimum requirement for the 18-month cohort is to hold a Bachelor's degree. However, Riverola highlighted this requirement because the institute will provide a Master’s degree, and "accredited Master’s degrees require an undergraduate degree."

"I know some successful traders who have been in the field for many years, making a very good living out of it, but do not hold a Bachelor's degree," he added.

Despite the high price tag and rigorous admission requirements, the International Trading Institute’s first course has already received "some applications." However, the institute will start its course in September 2025.

**"Initially, Our Goal Is Not to Be Profitable"**

Despite the high fees, the limited seats restrict the unique institute's expected turnover. Even if it manages to fill the 25 seats, the institute can collect only €700,000 from fees.

"Initially, our goal is not to be profitable," said Riverola. "Our goal is to try to cover the cost if possible, and if not, as long as we are accomplishing our goals of quality and satisfaction, it's fine by us. We know this will not happen from day one; it will take time."

He further emphasised that the future cost of more elaborate courses would be higher. "That's not going to be the price of the Master's in two to three years, probably," Riverola said regarding the €28,000 fees, adding: "If there is a second edition, it’s going to be more expensive. Later on, things might change, but initially, it’s a high price as the course is not trivial."

However, the institute will also offer sponsorships, and financial aid will be available to eligible candidates. As Riverola pointed out, "Anyone with potential who joins in and cannot afford the cost of the course will receive the scholarship." However, his institute does not currently offer many scholarships; "it will depend on the needs of the students and the admission process."
