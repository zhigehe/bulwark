Shares of Rollins fell after the company's fourth-quarter earnings missed analysts' views.

The stock declined 5.2%, to $47.50, in after-hours trading Wednesday. Shares ended the regular session roughly flat, at $50.10, putting them up 13% in the past year.

The Atlanta-based pest control company posted a profit of $105.7 million, down from $108.8 million a year earlier. Earnings of 22 cents a share just missed the 23 cents a share that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting.

On an adjusted basis, quarterly earnings were 23 cents a share, in line with analyst forecasts.

Revenue rose 10% to $832 million, coming in ahead of the $817.6 million that analysts surveyed by FactSet modeled.

Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Krause said that growth investments and pressure from developments on legacy auto claims in December hurt margins during the quarter.

Rollins said it expects strong organic growth in 2025, citing the health of core pest-control markets and the company's operations. The company this year will focus on pricing, ongoing modernization efforts and acquisitions.
