Skanska has signed a contract with DXC Technology to manage Skanska's global IT infrastructure operations. With this solution, Skanska aims to meet new demands for modern and flexible IT infrastructure services. The overall ambition is to enhance operational efficiency and increase the focus on innovative and client-centric solutions.

Starting 1 July 2025, Skanska will introduce a restructured IT organization, transitioning its global IT infrastructure organization to DXC Technology. With this move, Skanska will establish a robust foundation for delivering high quality IT services, optimizing operations across regions, and enhancing its security capabilities.

As part of the agreement, both services and employees currently managing Skanska's global IT infrastructure operations will be transferred to DXC Technology.
