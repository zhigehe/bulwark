China's AI-related stocks have rallied on DeepSeek's breakthrough but could face near-term headwinds, HSBC analysts say in a research note. AI-related stocks, ranging from hardware to software and applications, currently account for more than 50% of the A-share market turnover, though they make up only 15% of the market capitalization, the analysts say. They note that these stocks could have stretched valuations, with the stocks trading at the high end of their historical prices since 2019. From a long-term perspective, however, these tech stocks still have sufficient upside for a rerating, the analysts add. "China's stock market has yet to reflect China's improving innovation capability." (sherry.qin@wsj.com)
