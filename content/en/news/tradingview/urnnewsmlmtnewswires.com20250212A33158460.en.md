The consumer price index rose by 0.5% in January and was up 0.4% excluding food and energy prices, both above expectations.

The gain lifted the year-over-year increase to 3% from 2.9% in December, the highest since June 2024, while the core measure was up 3.3% year-over-year after a 3.2% rate in the previous month.

Food prices rose by 0.4%, while energy prices increased by 1.1%. Gasoline prices were up 1.8%.

Owners' equivalent rents and regular rents were both up 0.3%, the same as in the previous month and accounting for about one-third of the overall gain.

Prices of new vehicles were flat, but prices of used vehicles jumped by 2.2% and airline fares were up 1.2%. Apparel prices declined by 1.4%.

The US Treasury posted a $128.64 billion budget deficit in January compared with the $94.8 billion deficit expected and larger than the $21.93 billion budget deficit a year earlier.

The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 2.3% gain in mortgage applications in the week ended Friday after a 2.2% increase in the previous week. Refinancing activity surged while new home applications declined despite a further reduction in mortgage rates.

Total crude oil inventories rose by 4.3 million barrels in the week ended Friday with commercial oil inventories up 4.1 million and stocks in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve up 200,000. Gasoline inventories decreased last week, while distillate inventories increased.
