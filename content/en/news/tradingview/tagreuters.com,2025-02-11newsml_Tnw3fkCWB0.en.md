Quebec is globally recognized as a premier jurisdiction for mineralexploration and extraction. Consistently ranked among the topmining-friendly regions by the Fraser Institute, Quebec boasts astrong natural resource-based economy with a rich history in miningand mineral processing.

The Abitibi Gold Belt hosts several major gold producers, fromworld-renowned producing gold and industrial metal majors to juniorexplorers. While renowned for its rich gold mining history, the belthas yielded over 300 million ounces of silver, 15 billion tons ofcopper, and 35 billion tons of zinc from its base metal mines.

Tier-1 Gold Producers Surround theBazooka and Arrowhead Properties

Established in 1957, Agnico is one of the region’s largest goldproducers, with key operations at the LaRonde, Goldex, and CanadianMalartic mines. LaRonde, one of Canada’s largest gold mines, hasproduced over 5 million ounces of gold, while Agnico’s 50% stake inCanadian Malartic (fully acquired in 2023) solidifies its dominance inthe region.

In 2022, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. completed a $13.5 billion merger withKirkland Lake Gold, consolidating major assets in the belt—including the high-grade Macassa Mine and DetourLake Mine. Agnico Eagle further expanded in 2023 by acquiring YamanaGold Inc.’s 50% stake in the Canadian Malartic Mine, gaining fullownership, while other Yamana assets were acquired by Gold Fields Ltd.

Newmont Corporation, the world’s largest gold producer, strengthenedits foothold in the region with the 2019 acquisition of Goldcorp Inc.for $10 billion. The acquisition included key Canadian assets such asthe Porcupine Gold Mines in Timmins, Ontario. In addition, HeclaMining expanded its Canadian footprint in 2022 through the acquisitionof Alexco Resource Corp, primarily focused on silver but with futurepotential for gold exploration.

The region remained active for acquisition activity last year, withQuebec-based explorer Yorbeau Resources Inc. agreeing to sell itsflagship Rouyn gold property to Lac Gold Pty Ltd. C$25 million. TheRouyn property spans a 12-km section of the Cadillac-Larder LakeBreak, a major fault zone in Quebec’s Abitibi region, coveringnearly 27 km².

To date, Opawica has only drilled andexplored 15% of the Bazooka project, leaving 85% still untouched.Historically, the explored portion of Bazooka has yielded high-gradedrill intercepts ranging from 7.5 grams per ton (gpt) Au over 25.77mand reaching up to 316.23 gpt over a 1-meter section in Hole#BA-03-02A.

As gold prices continue to rise and new discoveries are made, thejurisdiction-friendly Abitibi Gold Belt is expected to remain one ofthe world’s top gold-producing regions. Opawica aims to capitalizeon favorable price fundamentals by unlocking Bazooka’s goldmineralization potential through this new drill campaign.
