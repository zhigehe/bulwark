Grades rose on Wednesday, dealers said, with MEH trading at a nine-month high.

Permian-quality crude arriving by pipeline to the Magellan East Houston (MEH) terminal, the main price assessment point along the Gulf Coast traded at its highest level since mid-May on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week as refinery maintenance continued, while gasoline stockpiles posted a surprise draw, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.

Crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels to 427.9 million barrels in the week ended February 7, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 3 million-barrel rise.

Elsewhere, Russia may be forced to throttle back its oil output in the coming months as U.S. sanctions hamper its access to tankers to sail to Asia and Ukrainian drone attacks hobble its refineries.
