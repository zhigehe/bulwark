CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **CEMATRIX Corporation**  (OTCQB: CTXXF) ("**CEMATRIX**" or the "**Company**"), a specialty construction contractor that produces cellular concrete solutions on site and is a leading manufacturer and supplier of cellular concrete in North America.

**New Contract Awards:**

CEMATRIX announces that it has won $5.8 million in new contract awards. These awards are split between executed contracts and contracts in process.

Significant awards as part of the $5.8 total include:

* a contract for a large heavy tunnel grouting application;
* a contract for an increase in scope of a large lightweight fill application on a bridge abutment project;
* a change order for additional lightweight fill applications on a light rail transit extension project.

“These awards demonstrate the continued confidence that our customers have in CEMATRIX’s sales and operations teams to deliver a quality product on time and on budget. We continue to see strong bidding activity and a robust sales pipeline well into the future and we are excited for the spring weather to kick start what we expect to be a busy 2025,” stated Mr. Randy Boomhour, President and CEO of CEMATRIX Corporation.

Going forward, the Company will provide its backlog information as part of its quarterly financial reporting process in its Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

**Corporate Update:**

“It is business as usual at CEMATRIX. Winter months are traditionally slower months with lower sales activity and lower revenue due to the seasonality inherent in the construction industry in the winter months,” stated Mr. Boomhour.

“With respect to the potential impact of tariffs, our Canadian and US operations buy materials including cement or ready-mix locally. We manufacture and supply our product on site. As a result, there is very little crossover between borders and we do not expect any material impact from any potential tariffs,” continued Mr. Boomhour.

“We are a growth company with positive adjusted EBITDA, positive cashflow from operations, and a healthy balance sheet. Our focus is on our customers – providing solutions to their requirements and exceeding their expectations. When we successfully focus on our customers, both our revenues and bottom-line benefit. As we continue to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA, our valuation will increase, and it is through our business plan execution in 2025 and beyond that we intend to grow long term value for our shareholders. This is our focus. We are set up for a great year in 2025,” concluded Mr. Boomhour.
