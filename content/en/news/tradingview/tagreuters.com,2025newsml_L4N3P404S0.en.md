Chicago corn futures rose for a second straight session on Thursday, support by tightening global stocks, while soybeans gained on bargain-hunting after weak Chinese demand and higher supply outlook drove prices lower in the previous session.

Wheat futures slipped for a fifth straight session amid a lack of bullish news, even as traders monitored freeze risks to wheat crops in the U.S. Plains and Black Sea region.

FUNDAMENTALS

\* The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) gained 0.27% to $10.3 a bushel by 0145 GMT after two sessions of declines.

\* The Chicago corn contract gained 0.1% to $4.90-6/8 a bushel, up for a second session on strong demand, while wheat dropped 0.09% to $5.74 a bushel.

\* In its monthly report on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture kept U.S. soybean and corn end-of-season supply forecasts unchanged, contrary to analyst expectations, and lowered Argentina's corn and soybean production outlook due to hot, dry weather.

\* Argentina's 2024/25 soybean crop is forecast at 47.5 million metric tons, while the corn crop estimate is lowered to 46 million tons, down 4% from the previous forecast, according to the Rosario grains exchange.

\* Heavy rains in Argentina's key agricultural regions offered relief to soy and corn crops, the exchange said.

\* Global soybean supplies are expected to rise due to Brazil's bumper crop.

\* The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed private sales of 130,320 metric tons of U.S. corn and 120,000 tons of U.S. soybeans for shipment to unknown destinations in the 2024/25 marketing year.

\* Traders monitored cold fronts in the U.S. Plains and Black Sea; snow could protect Midwest wheat, but dryness in the Southern Plains may stress hard red winter wheat.

\* Commodity funds were net buyers of corn on Wednesday but net sellers of soybean, soyoil, soymeal, and wheat futures.
