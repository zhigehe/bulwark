SINGAPORE, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Primech AI Pte. Ltd. ("Primech AI"), a subsidiary of Primech Holdings Limited , proudly announces the signing of three important pilot program agreements for its groundbreaking HYTRON AI-powered cleaning robots. These agreements with established Singapore-based cleaning companies, including a leading provider of facilities and industrial services operating across Singapore, China, and Malaysia, represent a major expansion of Primech AI’s market presence and a solid vote of confidence in its advanced AI technology.

These agreements involve deploying HYTRON units across various sectors, showcasing the versatility and efficiency of these AI-powered cleaning solutions. The HYTRON units are powered by NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super, a state-of-the-art System-on-Module (SoM) designed for robust edge AI and robotics applications robots that will enhance hygiene standards and operational efficacy at several key facilities, reflecting growing industry confidence in robotic automation.

At the core of HYTRON’s navigation capabilities is a multi-sensor system consisting of (1) LIDAR for Mapping and Navigation, which enhances both precision and safety; (2) Ultrasonic Sensors for Proximity Detection to identify nearby objects and adjust its path accordingly, ensuring seamless movement through cluttered spaces without colliding with furniture or other obstacles; and (3) AI-powered Camera Sensors for Object Identification to recognize and classify bathroom objects, such as sinks, toilets, and mirrors. This ensures it applies the appropriate cleaning technique to each surface, enhancing its efficiency in commercial restroom cleaning.

Under the two-year pilot program agreements, these prominent cleaning companies will integrate HYTRON robots into their daily facility operations. This reflects the sector's readiness to embrace innovative cleaning solutions that promise to revolutionize facility management through enhanced efficiency and reduced costs. This deployment is set to showcase the substantial benefits of integrating AI-powered automation into traditional cleaning processes.

Each pilot program agreement includes full support from Primech AI’s customer service framework, ensuring that HYTRON operates at peak efficiency and reliability. In addition, Primech AI will conduct staff training for the companies to ensure the effective operation and maintenance of the robots.

“Our three new esteemed partners for these pilot programs have a combined 75 years of facilities service and have worked on nearly 1,000 different commercial cleaning projects. Securing these leases is a strong endorsement of HYTRON’s capabilities and our Company’s direction,” stated Charles Ng, Chief Operating Officer of Primech AI. “We believe HYTRON is the future of cleaning and look forward to sharing updates with our shareholders about our continued development as the facility management industry reflects a continued shift and acceptance of robotic solutions.”
