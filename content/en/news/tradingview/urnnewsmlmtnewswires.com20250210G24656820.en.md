Drax Group and the UK government signed a nonbinding heads of terms for a low-carbon dispatchable contract-for-difference deal for the renewable energy company's Drax Power Station.

The proposed agreement has a four-year term starting April 2027 and ending and March 2031. The contract includes a strike price of 113 pounds sterling per megawatt-hour for the plant's four biomass units, with an estimated generation collar of 6 terawatt-hours per year, according to a Monday filing.

The deal is projected to bring savings of between 1.6 billion pounds and 3.1 billion pounds for consumers. Drax Power Station is also expected to adjust its electricity generation depending on high or low demand to help secure local energy security.
