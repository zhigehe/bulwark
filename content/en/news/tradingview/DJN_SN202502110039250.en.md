Refiner Phillips 66 is the latest target of activist investor Elliott Management that is aggressively pursuing companies in the energy space.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott, which had previously disclosed a $1 billion investment in the company, has now pushed its stake to more than $2.5 billion.

Elliott plans to push Phillips 66 into selling or spinning off its midstream business, the report said.

Phillips 66 already has disposed of more than $3.5 billion of what it calls non-core assets, the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. Its midstream business was by far the most profitable unit in the fourth quarter.

Phillips 66 shares (PSX) rose 3% in premarket trade.

BP shares (BP) surged on Monday when reports emerged that Elliott was building a stake. The investor also has taken on Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Suncor Energy and Hess.
