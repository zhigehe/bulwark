Oil futures fall for a third consecutive week as the market grappled with complications from postponed U.S. tariffs on oil from Canada and Mexico, Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. oil and gas, OPEC+ sticking with its plan to start raising output in April and an oversized buildup in U.S. crude oil stocks. "Some of the impact this week has been more from the growth in inventories," says Kenny Zhu of Global X. "I think folks have been worried about what the tariff impact might actually be, so there's a bit of front-running of imports to try to bring in those barrels in front of the trigger date. Luckily that was pushed back." WTI settles up 0.6% at $71 a barrel Brent up 0.5% at $74.66 a barrel, and are down 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively, on the week. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)
