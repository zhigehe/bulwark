Asian currencies consolidate against the dollar in the morning session as traders assess U.S. President Trump's tariff policy. Trump on Thursday ordered federal agencies to explore how to adjust U.S. tariffs to match those of other countries. However, Trump's order stops short of actually imposing tariffs immediately. "Tariff ambiguity still reigns," NAB's Ray Attrill says in a commentary. "But, markets are currently drawing some comfort from the news the next set won't come into effect before April," the head of FX Research says. USD/JPY is 0.1% lower at 152.63; USD/KRW edges 0.1% higher to 1,441.53; AUD/USD is little changed at 0.6318. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
