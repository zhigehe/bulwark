RBC Capital Markets slightly lowered its price target and estimates on ING Groep after the Dutch financial institution provided a worse-than-expected outlook on costs for 2025 with its full-year 2024 earnings report.

"We were already at the lower end of [net interest income] margin guidance going into results," analysts wrote Feb. 7. "We had expected ING would manage towards its cost income ratio guidance in 2025 (54-55%) but cost guidance implies a cost income ratio of below 56%. Higher inflation and investments drive the higher cost run rate."

As such, the research firm kept the stock at sector perform and edged down the price target to 18.25 euros from 18.50 euros. EPS estimates for 2025 and 2026 were also adjusted to 1.96 euros and 2.28 euros, respectively, from previous estimates of 1.97 euros and 2.31 euros.
