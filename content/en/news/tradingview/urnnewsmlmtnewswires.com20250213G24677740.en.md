HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering unveiled a prototype for a small modular reactor (SMR)-powered container carrier at the New Nuclear for Maritime Summit in Houston, US earlier this week, The Korea Herald reported Thursday.

Based on a 15,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU)-class vessel, the design received approval in principle from the American Bureau of Shipping, ensuring compliance with key safety standards, the report said.

The shipbuilder aims to finalize its marine nuclear business model by 2030, integrating enhanced safety features, including a double-tank radiation containment system, it said.

Shares of HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering fell nearly 6% in recent trade on Friday.
