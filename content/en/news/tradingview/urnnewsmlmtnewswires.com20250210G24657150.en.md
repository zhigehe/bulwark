Indian equities extended losses for the fourth straight session on Monday as investor sentiment weakened following US President Donald Trump's renewed tariff threats.

Trump said he would impose a 25% duty on all steel and aluminum imports into the US, along with additional reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries.

The uncertainty surrounding US trade policies added to selling pressure in domestic markets, analysts said.
