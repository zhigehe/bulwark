The conditions for corn growing in Argentina have improved thanks to better soil conditions. Corn led CBOT grains lower throughout the day, and government agencies in the country say that better rain has had a positive effect on the health of crops. "The Buenos Aires Exchange said late planted corn in southern Cordoba and western Buenos Aires province have seen a 21% improvement in adequate to optimal soil moisture, and said that early harvesting has begun in Entre Rios province," says Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. If Argentina's crop production manages to come in at or above forecasts, then it may prove to be stiff competition to corn grown in the U.S. due to more-competitive pricing. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)
