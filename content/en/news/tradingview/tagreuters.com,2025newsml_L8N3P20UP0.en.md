\*\* Citigroup cuts its rating on BPER Banca to "neutral" from "buy" after the Italian lender launched a 4.3 billion euro ($4.44 billion) bid for smaller peer Banca Popolare di Sondrio

\*\* The broker says it sees limited benefits for BPER's minority shareholders and questions the long-term outlook for the potential combined entity; keeps its PT unchanged at 6.95 euros

\*\* Citi notes that BPER's expected ROTE target for the combined entity in 2027 at around 15% is slightly below the estimate of above 16% presented in its latest stand-alone business plan, while it forecasts an only minimal EPS growth

\*\* "We are less convinced if the proposed transaction (...) is the optimum use of capital of all shareholders," it says

\*\* However, the presence of Unipol as a main shareholder in both banks and the low acceptance threshold - 35% plus one share given the shareholding structure - suggest the deal could be successful, Citi adds

\*\* Out of nine analysts that cover BPER, six rate the stock "strong buy" or "buy" and three rate it "hold"

($1 = 0.9690 euros)
