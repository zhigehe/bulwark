Amazon.com is being accused of violating state and federal privacy laws by harvesting location data from tens of millions of people using its apps and software development tools without their consent.

The suit filed Monday in a federal court in Washington alleges that the company used "biometric data and precise location information" to target advertising on its apps and generating revenue for the company.

The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, is asking monetary damages, restitution or injunctive relief.
