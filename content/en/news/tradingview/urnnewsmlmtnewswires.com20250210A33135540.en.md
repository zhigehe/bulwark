Innoviz Technologies said Monday it has agreed to sell about 28.78 million units, each consisting of one ordinary share and a portion of a warrant, at $1.39 per unit in a registered direct offering expected to raise gross proceeds $40 million.

Each warrant is immediately exercisable at $1.69 and will be valid for five years, the company said.

Net proceeds from the offering, expected to close Tuesday, will be used for general corporate purposes, Innoviz said.

Shares of the company were down by nearly 16% in recent Monday premarket activity.
