Australia has passed new legislation to provide tax incentives for companies producing renewable hydrogen or processing critical minerals, aiming to boost green industries and reduce reliance on China’s supply chain.

Starting in July 2027, eligible producers will receive tax discounts for up to 10 years per project.

The legislation also introduces a 10% production tax credit for refining critical minerals like lithium and nickel, also available for up to a decade.

Combined, these incentives are valued at AUD 13.7 billion over 10 years and are part of the government’s Future Made in Australia policy.

In a joint statement, federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen described the tax incentives as critical to “seizing the vast economic and industrial opportunities” of the net-zero transition.

The bill’s passage has been widely welcomed by industry stakeholders.
