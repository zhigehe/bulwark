\*\* Shares in CCC jump more than 10% after the Polish footwear and fashion retailer on Monday reported preliminary Q4 results above market expectations

\*\* It posts 122% y/y jump in preliminary Q4 core profit to 525 million zlotys ($129.36 million), compared with 442 million zlotys expected by analysts polled by Reuters

\*\* "EBITDA and EBIT were 19% and 28% above consensus, respectively, and also significantly beat our estimates," Trigon analyst Grzegorz Kujawski says in a note

\*\* "Results were positively surprised by an 8% y/y decrease in SG&A costs," Kujawski adds

\*\* Piotr Bogusz from Erste Group notes the positive surprise was also due to Modivo's strong performance, driven by improved gross margins and effective SG&A cost optimization, with benefits expected to continue in the coming quarters

\*\* "Modivo has already shown the first signs of improvement in Q3'24/25, nevertheless the Q4'24/25 result only reinforces the belief that the positive earnings momentum for this segment can be maintained," Bogusz says

\*\* CCC is on top of Poland's mid-cap index

($1 = 4.0585 zlotys)
