Diagonal Bio raised 6 million kronor from its oversubscribed offer of rights issue.

The offer closed Feb. 6, according to a Feb. 7 release. The Swedish biotechnology company will issue 601,071,318 new shares and 267,142,808 warrants of series TO 2 after subscriptions.

In addition to the rights offering, the company also issued units to Red√©n Trotting and Svea Bank, increasing total proceeds from the issuance of units to 7.7 million kronor.

Diagonal Bio will receive an additional 3.4 million kronor in June if all attached warrants to the units are exercised. Chief Executive Officer Karin Wehlin said the company will be financed until the first quarter of 2026 with the full exercise of the warrants.
