Gold edges higher in the early Asian session. U.S. President Trump said that he plans to impose 25% tariffs Monday on imports of steel and aluminum, which could spur safe-haven demand by investors fearful of Trump's trade policies. Trump also said that he plans to make an announcement about reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Spot gold is 0.3% higher at $2,867.96/oz. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
