Ether's price is outperforming the cryptocurrency market on Feb. 6, with 4% daily gains to trade above $2,800. The total crypto market capitalization is up 0.65% over the last 24 hours to reach $3.23 trillion.![Cryptocurrencies, Markets, Market Analysis, Ether Price, Ethereum Price](https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:ff6ec9409094b-851bd3358fa34dbde164d1a5f1812e64-resized.jpeg)

Ether’s outperformance today can be attributed to several factors, including:

* Increasing investor interest surrounding the upcoming Pectra upgrade.
* Increasing inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs.
* ETH bulls attempting to flip $3,000 into support.

****Upcoming Pectra Upgrade****

One bullish catalyst for Ether price is the much-anticipated Pectra upgrade.

Things to know:

* It is set to be one of the most significant upgrades to Ethereum in history.
* Aims to improve scalability, increase transaction speeds, and reduce gas fees by doubling the blob space in Ethereum blocks, among other features.
* Slated for March 2025, with test runs on Ethereum's test networks, Sepolia and Holesky, throughout February.
* By making the network more efficient and cost-effective, Pectra could attract more developers to build on Ethereum
* This could increase demand for ETH.

The excitement around these improvements has undoubtedly contributed to the bullish sentiment around Ethereum, pushing its price upward as traders price in a potentially more robust and scalable platform.

Ethereum researcher Justin Drake believes that the Pectra upgrade will reduce ETH supply.

In a Feb. 5 post on X, Drake said:

“To become ultrasound again, either issuance has to decrease, or the burn has to increase. I believe both will happen.”

A lot of bullish things are happening now with Ethereum, including the Pectra upgrade, “and none of them have been priced in,” said crypto investor Ted Pillows, adding:

“Along with that, sentiment is at ATL, which is the best signal for reversal. $5K ETH is coming before April 2025.”

****ETH price boosted by high ETF inflows****

Adding to Ether’s bullish momentum on Feb. 6 is the significant inflows into US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the last couple of weeks.

* Spot ETH ETFs have recorded positive inflows for five straight days, totaling $421.5 million.
* Year-to-date inflows are now $1.1B, and the cumulative total net inflow is $3.17B.

* BlackRock’s ETHA fund was the primary buyer with $579 million in inflows between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5.
* These ETFs are expected to attract substantial investments in 2025, especially if regulatory changes allow staking.

****Ether price needs to reclaim $3,000****

From a technical perspective, Ether’s marker is slightly biased to the downside, suggesting that increased selling could lead to another correction.

* The relative strength index is below its neutral level, indicating that the bears hold the advantage.
* The moving averages have produced a bearish cross, positioning ETH price for more downside.

Conversely, the ETH will likely resume the uptrend if $3,000 is reclaimed as support.

* The price has historically rallied between 20% and 35% after overcoming and holding above the said level.
* The ETH support zone to watch for a rebound is right above $2,700, according to the liquidation heatmap from CoinGlass.
* If ETH turns $3,000 as support, it could rally toward the Dec. 16 range high of $4,100, or 44% gains from current levels.
