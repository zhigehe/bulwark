The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note remained relatively unchanged around 4.49% on Monday, as investors awaited key economic data this week that could impact the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook.

The latest consumer inflation report is set to be released on Wednesday, followed by weekly jobless claims and producer inflation data on Thursday.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak before Congress, with tariffs likely to be a central topic.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump announced a blanket 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, effective later today, along with additional tariffs to be disclosed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

This move comes as China’s retaliatory tariffs on select US exports are set to take effect, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that the EU is prepared to respond "within an hour" if the US imposes tariffs on European goods.
