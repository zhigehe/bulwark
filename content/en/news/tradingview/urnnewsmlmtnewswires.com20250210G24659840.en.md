South Korea's Kyobo Life Insurance settled a seven-year dispute with private equity firm Affirma Capital by purchasing its 5.33% stake for 198,000 won per share, which was about half of Affirma's original demand, Pulse News reported Monday.

The conflict stemmed from a failed initial public offering and Affirma's 2018 exercise of a put option at 397,900 won per share. Affirma will now withdraw its arbitration case, the report said.

The settlement may influence Kyobo Life's ongoing dispute with Affinity Equity Partners, which exercised a similar option at 410,000 won per share, it said.
