CEO Erik Stenfors comments on the report:

"HANZA is a group in constant motion, driven by a clear strategy and a strong corporate culture. In 2024, we maintained a high development pace - something that is appreciated by both customers and colleagues. We integrated the acquisition of Orbit One in our clusters in Sweden and Central Europe, and continued our organic expansion by opening new factories in Estonia and Sweden.

We ended the year with a strategically important acquisition of a Finnish company, Leden Group, which strengthens our competence and capacity in mechanical manufacturing, broadens our customer base in a good way and increases our presence in Finland and the Baltics. With a strong 2024 behind us, and a clear strategy going forward, HANZA is well equipped for the future."
