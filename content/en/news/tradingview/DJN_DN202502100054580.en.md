MEXICO CITY--Mexico's production of cars and light trucks rose 1.7% in January from the year-earlier month to 312,257 units, while exports fell 14% to 219,414 units, statistics institute Inegi said Monday.

Domestic new-car sales in Mexico, which include imported models, totaled 119,811 units in January, a 5.9% increase from the year-earlier month.

Mexico produced a record 3.99 million light vehicles in 2024, and exported a record 3.48 million units.

Mexican auto-industry association AMIA has said the expectation is for production to exceed 4 million units in 2025, and for exports to reach 3.5 million. The auto-dealership association sees new-car sales rising 2.1% to 1.53 million units, assuming that the economy grows 1.1%, while a 1% decline in economic output could lead to a 1.5% drop in sales.
