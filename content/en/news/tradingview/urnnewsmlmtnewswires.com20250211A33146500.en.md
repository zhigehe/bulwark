Atlassian said Tuesday it is forming a long-term title partnership with the Williams Racing Formula 1 team, rebranding it as Atlassian Williams Racing.

Under the deal, Atlassian becomes the official title partner, official technology partner, and official collaboration software partner of the team, the company said.

Atlassian's System of Work approach aims to support Williams' comeback plan by connecting all teams and using AI to increase efficiency, it said.

Atlassian's branding will appear prominently on the FW47 race cars for the 2025 F1 season with a new merged logo, combining Atlassian and Williams Racing features, according to the company.

Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed.
