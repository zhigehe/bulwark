Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, said Saturday he only does what he knows and loves, and launching a meme coin is not among them. The rap mogul firmly dismissed swirling rumors of a possible coin launch, stating that he only pursues things he's "passionate and knowledgeable about."

"IM NOT DOING A COIN," Ye wrote on X. "I MAKE PRODUCTS."

Ye, whose net worth stands at $400 million according to Forbes, said he is too rich for that. The head behind Yeezys, some of the most iconic, hyped sneakers, added that coins feast on fan hype, "JUST LIKE HYPED UP SNEAKERS CULTURE."

Following the 2025 Grammy Awards, Ye's all-caps outburst on X has put him back in the spotlight this weekend. Posts that touched on "coin" and "crypto" especially drew attention from members of the crypto community.

In one post, he stated, "WHEN PEOPLE MAKE ALL THAT MONEY WITH A COIN IS THAT CASH OR CONCEPT.” The statement triggered crypto community buzz. Many encouraged him to launch his own coin.

And as the statement circulated, searches for "Ye" and "West" coins trended on Pump.fun. A Solana token using the ticker "YE" shot up almost 290% on Friday before rapidly declining, according to CoinGecko.

In another post, Ye revealed that he rejected a $2 million offer to promote a fraudulent "ye currency" on X. He later signaled interest in connecting with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.
