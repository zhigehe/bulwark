Guelph, Ontario, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Skyline, a Canadian capital management company that offers private alternative investments in real estate and clean energy, sees opportunity ahead for those looking to invest in Canadian real estate investment trusts (REITs) and renewable energy infrastructure.

In their *2025 REIT and Clean Energy Fund Outlook* report, released today, Skyline offers its analysis of the macroeconomic trends impacting Canada’s real estate investment trust (REIT) market, along with insights into the growing need for renewable energy infrastructure.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE REPORT**

* Skyline anticipates favourable conditions for strong REIT and renewable energy investment performance for 2025, thanks to an increasingly normalized interest rate environment.

* Canada has entered a more moderate inflationary environment, which historically has promoted favourable to REIT returns.

* The current environment presents opportunity for disciplined investors looking to mitigate risk and identify value with private alternative investments.

As one of Canada’s largest multiclass REIT operators—public or private—Skyline has a unique perspective on the interplay between the economy and real estate and clean energy investment in Canada.
