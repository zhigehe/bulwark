Fed Chairman Jerome Powell (voter) said that the Federal Open Market Committee does not need to rush to lower rates, but repeated that the FOMC will also be nimble in reacting to incoming data and conditions and could lower rates faster or hold rates steady for longer depending on what is needed, calling monetary policy "well positioned" to address any uncertainties and risks.

Powell also committed to tailoring bank regulations to reduce unnecessary burdens, saying that large banks' capital remains about right.
