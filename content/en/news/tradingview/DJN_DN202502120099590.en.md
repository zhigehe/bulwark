Restaurant Brands International's comparable sales are slowing, but they are still ahead of the quick service restaurant industry thanks to its performance in France. TD Cowen's Andrew Charles says in a report that the company's international segment saw comparable sales growth of 4.7% which "continues the 4Q industry trend of outperformance, exceeding our 3% estimate & 2.8% consensus." Charles says RBI's international business is dominated by BK France, but not all is rosy. RBI cited bad debt expense incurred from the BK China business which continues to be a drag.
