Washington, D.C., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — FrankSpeech Network, Inc (“FSBN”), currently being rebranded as Mike Lindell Media Corp., announces the addition of Vanessa Broussard, who extensively covered political events and rallies across the country during the 2024 presidential election for Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN). Ms. Broussard is an Emmy nominated journalist with over 25 years of news experience. Prior to working with RSBN, Ms. Broussard was a news anchor in Southeast Texas. She also covered several major disasters. Vanessa has a Radio/Television Broadcast Journalism degree from Sam Houston State University and extensive experience in news producing, reporting and anchoring.

In 2017, Vanessa traveled to Washington, D.C. to cover the Inauguration of President Donald J. Trump. She brings with her a large nationwide audience and will be co-host along with Mike Lindell for the “The LindellTV Report” Monday-Friday on LindellTV.

Vanessa Broussard said, “I am honored to join Mike Lindell, a powerhouse in the Republican Party. I have always respected Mike and his willingness to fight for a better, stronger America. At Lindell TV, I look forward to bringing the American people real stories, bold interviews and coverage you can trust.”

Mike Lindell said, “We’re absolutely thrilled to have Vanessa Broussard on board, who brings with her 25 years of responsible and accurate experience and reporting. Vanessa was at the rally the day our great President took a bullet for all of us. Her relatable and compassionate style make her an incredible asset to the team. She and everyone at the Rally showed great courage that day".

Our heartfelt prayers continue to go out to the entire Cory Comperatore family as Cory paid the ultimate price by giving his life for his family and friends. We also wish everyone who was wounded that day the very best. We love you and pray for you all. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." John 15:13 (KJV)
