CAB Payments Holdings said Richard Hallett has stepped down as chief financial officer and executive director with immediate effect.

The London-listed fintech group said Monday that it would disclose the details of Hallett's exit agreement in its 2024 annual report, and that it has kicked off the search for his replacement.

Matthew Talty, currently group head of banking, will temporarily serve as CFO until a replacement is found, the company said.

Hallett had worked for CAB Payments for nine years.
