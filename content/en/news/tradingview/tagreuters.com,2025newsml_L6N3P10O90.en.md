Key points:

Risk sentiment was fragile in Latin America on Monday, as investors weighed the implications of U.S. President [Donald Trump's](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) latest threats on global trade and monitored geopolitical developments in the Middle East.

Trump is expected to announce 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. on Monday or Tuesday, according to a source, and will potentially unveil further a set of reciprocal tariffs on top trade partners later in the week.

The latest threats follow Trump ordering tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods on February 1, before giving both countries a one-month reprieve after negotiations.

Steel exporter Mexico's peso dipped 0.2% on Monday, while local stocks were up 0.6%.

Metals exporter Brazil's real firmed 0.3%, while its Bovespa index added 0.8%. Steelmaker Gerdau , which has units in the U.S., rose 5.8% after the tariff news.

Officials from both Latin American economies said that they will wait to see whether the U.S. President announces the import duties before reacting.

With each Trump announcement, markets have braced for possible volatility on concerns over potential retaliatory measures and an increasingly uncertain outlook for emerging market assets.

When asked on investing strategies against a volatile backdrop, Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, an emerging markets debt portfolio manager at BankInvest said, "in the countries or companies or sectors where we believe there is more risk of a headline coming, we are normally 'neutral' or 'underweight', or you can just outright add more if it's a country or a jurisdiction or sector where you think he won't be (targeting again) too quickly."

More broadly, MSCI's index tracking regional currencies (.MILA00000CUS) was off 0.3%, while the stocks gauge (.MILA00000PUS) was 0.5% higher, after logging five consecutive weeks of gains on Friday.

Ecuador's government bonds plunged as they resumed trading, with the country now facing two months of uncertainty after its presidential election failed to produce a winner in the first round of voting between incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist Luisa Gonzalez.

The country's dollar-denominated bonds expiring in 2030 (XS2214237807=TE), 2035 (XS2214238441=TE) and 2040 (XS2214239175=TE) fell between 5 and 10 cents on the dollar.

"A series of blackouts in recent weeks, and still some degree of violence in different areas (has been hurting Noboa). He's still in the lead and maybe markets will reconsider in the next few days, but maybe not as much as before, considering that the second round won't be as easy as they thought it would be," Bueso added.

In the Middle East, Palestinian militant group Hamas announced it would stop releasing Israeli hostages until further notice over what it said were Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement announced about a month ago. Egyptian security sources feared the agreement's breakup.

Israeli dollar bonds (46513JXN6=) were last down 0.2 cents on the dollar, while the shekel dropped 0.6%.

Credit rating agency Moody's warned that the triple-A ratings of top multilateral lenders such as the World Bank would be at risk if the U.S. withdrew support for them.

Elsewhere, currencies of copper exporters Chile and Peru added about 0.1% each tracking higher prices of the red metal.

Oil exporter Colombia's peso dipped 0.5%, while its stocks (.COLCAP) were up 0.6%. Its Finance Ministry said on Friday that Colombia had met its fiscal rule in 2024 despite its fiscal deficit landing well above target and the government trimming its economic growth forecast.
