Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures fell on Monday on fears of retaliatory tariffs against U.S. grain exports as well as diminishing prospects for freeze damage to U.S. and Black Sea wheat crops.

* CBOT March soft red winter wheat (WH25) settled down 3-1/4 cents at $5.79-1/2 a bushel.
* K.C. March hard red winter wheat (KWH25) ended down 7-1/2 cents at $5.96-3/4 a bushel.
* Minneapolis March spring wheat (MWEH25) ended unchanged at $6.27-3/4 a bushel.
* President Donald Trump said he would order 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.
* Tariff worries and expectations that Tuesday's U.S. Department of Agriculture report will show substantial wheat ending stocks pressured wheat prices, along with diminished prospects of freeze damage to Black Sea and U.S. wheat crops.
* Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expect the U.S. Department of Agriculture to report U.S. wheat ending stocks at 799 million bushels in its upcoming supply and demand report on Tuesday, up from 798 million bushel in January.
* A cold front is headed in to key wheat-growing regions in the Black Sea and the U.S. Plains, but snow cover expected in the area has reduced the risks of winterkill.
