European stocks closed firmly higher on Monday, extending the peaks from last week and aligning with the rhetoric that European stocks have more favorable valuations than US counterparts, extending the momentum despite fresh tariff threats from the US. The Eurozone’s STOXX 50 jumped 0.7% to close at a near 25-year high, and the pan-European STOXX 600 advanced 0.7% to a new record high of 546.

US President Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum into the US and said new reciprocal tariffs would also be announced this week.

This came as China’s retaliatory tariffs on select US exports are set to take effect today.

Corporate gains were dominated by tech, industrials, and consumer discretionary stocks with Hermes, Ferrari, Siemens, Schneider, Prosus, and ASML jumping between 3% and 1.7%.

Outside the Eurozone, BP soared more than 7% after activist investors Elliott Management acquired a stake in the energy giant.
