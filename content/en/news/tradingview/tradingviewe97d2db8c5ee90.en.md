For Q1 2025, Quipt reported revenue of $61.4 million, a 2% decrease from $62.6 million in Q1 2024, and flat compared to Q4 2024. The company faced challenges due to the discontinuation of the Medicare 75/25 blended rate and the non-renewal of a disposable supply contract, impacting revenue by approximately $1.5 million for the quarter.

Net loss improved to ($1.1) million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, compared to ($1.5) million, or ($0.04) per diluted share in Q1 2024. Cash flow from operations was $9.3 million, down from $10.6 million in the same period last year. The company had $15.5 million in cash on hand as of December 31, 2024, with total credit availability of $32.4 million.

Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2025 was $14.0 million, representing 22.8% of revenue, an 8.7% decrease from $15.3 million (24.5% of revenue) in Q1 2024. However, Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially by 4.5% from Q4 2024.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The company's customer base grew by 1% year-over-year to approximately 157,000 unique patients. Quipt completed approximately 221,000 unique set-ups/deliveries in Q1 2025, a 3% increase from Q1 2024. The company's resupply program, a significant contributor to its 77% recurring revenue base, now serves 174,000 patients.

Quipt continues to see consistent demand and referral patterns across all major product categories, with approximately 36,000 referring physicians and over 140 locations.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Quipt is focused on driving organic revenue growth, achieving operational net profit, generating positive cash flow, and expanding Adjusted EBITDA. The company is optimizing its organizational structure to enhance operational efficiencies and streamline operations, positioning itself for sustainable long-term growth.

**Management's Perspective**

Gregory Crawford, Chairman and CEO, emphasized the company's progress in strengthening operations and positioning for long-term growth. He highlighted the focus on expanding presence in existing and new markets, leveraging the scalable business platform, and optimizing the organizational structure.
