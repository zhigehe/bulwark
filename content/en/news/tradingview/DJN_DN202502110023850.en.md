Kering's results show there was no real sign of improvement at Gucci, Bernstein analysts write in a note. The group's star label reported a 24% organic decline in revenue for the last three months, against consensus estimates of a 23% drop. The results follow the recent announcement that Sabato De Sarno is leaving the brand as creative chief. A strong replacement for De Sarno could work as a catalyst for both business and stock market improvement, they say. The most credible name reported by media could be fashion designer Hedi Slimane, who left LVMH's Celine brand in October, they add. Kering's tough year is reflected in its share price, they say. Shares have dropped around 40% in the past 12 months. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)
