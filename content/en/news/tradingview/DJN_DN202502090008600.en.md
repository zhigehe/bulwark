By Anne Steele

The Super Bowl's pregame performers are all Louisiana natives, in a nod to the host city's rich musical legacy.

Jon Batiste, a Grammy-winning jazz musician and former bandleader of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," will sing the national anthem. Musician and producer Trombone Shorty and Christian music singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle-also both Grammy winners-will perform "America the Beautiful" together.

Soul and R&B singer Ledisi, another Grammy winner, will perform the hymn "Lift Every Voice and Sing."
