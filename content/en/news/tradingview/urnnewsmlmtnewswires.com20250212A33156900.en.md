US crude oil stocks, including those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, rose by 4.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 7 following an increase of 8.9 million barrels in the previous week.

Excluding inventories in the SPR, commercial crude oil stocks rose by 4.1 million barrels after an 8.7-million-barrel increase in the previous week, a larger gain than the 2.3 million barrel increase expected in a survey compiled by Bloomberg as of 7:30 am ET.

Stocks in the SPR increased by 200,000 in the week after rising by 300,000 in the previous week.

Overall crude oil stocks were up 0.5% from the previous week and up 3.1% from a year earlier. Crude oil inventories are about 4% below the five-year average for this time of the year.

Gasoline stocks fell by 3 million barrels, compared with the 1.2 million barrel increase expected. Gasoline stocks were down 1.2% from the previous week, but up 0.3% from a year earlier.

Distillate stocks increased by 0.1 million barrels in the current week, compared with an expected decrease of 2.3 million barrels. Distillate stocks were up 0.1% from the previous week but were still 5.6% lower than in the same week a year ago.

Refineries operated at 85% of their capacity, up from 84.5% in the previous week.
