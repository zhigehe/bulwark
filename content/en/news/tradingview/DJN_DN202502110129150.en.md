DoorDash's international food-delivery business is growing, CFO Ravi Inukonda says on a call with analysts. "We're growing substantially faster than peers," Inukonda says, adding that the company reached all-time high monthly active users. Its order frequency continues to grow, too, Inukonda says. The company's goal is to scale the international business to drive efficiency, which will continue to lead to more gross profit in the system, the executive says.
