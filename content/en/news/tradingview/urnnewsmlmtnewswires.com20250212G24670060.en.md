Japan Display has signed an equity investment agreement and strategic alliance with Tech Extension Co., a Tokyo-based company specializing in 3D semiconductor integration, according to a Wednesday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The partnership will establish a next-generation 3D semiconductor integration manufacturing line at Japan Display's Ishikawa Fab, leveraging Tech Extension's Bumpless Build Cube (BBCube) technology.

The collaboration will incorporate wafer-on-wafer and chip-on-wafer stacking processes, aiming to improve efficiency in semiconductor packaging.

The manufacturing line is set to launch in the second half of 2025.
