Pronexus has entered into a capital and business alliance with Access Group Holdings , acquiring 160,000 shares, or 10% of its issued stock, through a third-party allotment, according to a Friday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The partnership builds on an existing 2023 agreement and aims to integrate Pronexus' expertise in investor communications with Access Group's human resources recruitment business.

Both firms seek synergies in content production, outsourcing, and corporate communications.

Access Group, which provides recruitment and promotional support, plans to use the capital injection for talent development, security enhancements, and business expansion.
