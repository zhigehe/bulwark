Swiss equities closed higher on Tuesday as markets digest the global response to fresh tariffs set to be imposed by the US.

The Swiss Market Index gained 0.53% at the end of the trading day.

US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum entering the country, with the new measures set to effect March 12, Reuters and other media outlets reported. In response, the European Union plans to take "firm and proportional countermeasures" to protect its economic interests. "Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Mexico and Canada also expressed their disapproval of the tariffs, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying his country will "stand up strongly and firmly" if necessary to defend against the tariffs.

"If the EU is hit by additional tariffs from March, it could simply reinstate its retaliatory tariffs on US exports. And, if history is anything to go by, EU policymakers will not be the only ones opting for retaliation," ING said. "With growth in the US likely to slow due to the tariffs, and with China already struggling to revive its economy, demand for industrial metals is likely to weaken ... President Trump has laid the foundations for further trade escalations. This will not be the last tariff move."

In corporate news, SGS jumped 6.69% as it reported a 5.1% year-over-year growth in 2024 profit attributable to equity holders to 581 million francs from 553 million francs, with sales also up over the period to 6.79 billion francs from 6.62 billion francs. Looking ahead, the Swiss testing and certification company expects organic sales growth to be between 5% and 7% in 2025.

Meanwhile, Novartis agreed to purchase US-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Anthos Therapeutics, with the Swiss drugmaker to pay $925 million upfront and potential payments of up to $2.15 billion based on certain regulatory and sales milestones. The deal is expected to complete in the first half. Novartis shares were up 1.13% at closing.
