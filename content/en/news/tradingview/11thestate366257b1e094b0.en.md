Court: E.D. Michigan

Case: 2:24-cv-12477

Domino’s Australia stock surged 23% after announcing the closure of 205 underperforming stores, mainly in Japan, and reporting strong early sales for fiscal 2025. The closures are expected to improve profitability, adding up to $12 million in annual earnings.

At the same time, investors sued Domino’s after the company promised big store growth but later admitted it would miss the target, leading to a 13% stock drop in July 2024.
