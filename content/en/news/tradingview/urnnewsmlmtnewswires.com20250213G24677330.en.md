The Korea Trade Commission will meet Feb. 20 to decide on potential anti-dumping measures against Chinese thick steel plate imports, Yonhap News reported Thursday.

Hyundai Steel filed a complaint in July 2024, prompting an investigation into low-priced Chinese imports affecting local producers. If the KTC assesses this is damaging to domestic firms, the South Korean government may impose tariffs, the report said.

Shares of Hyundai Steel rose nearly 3% in recent trade on Friday.
