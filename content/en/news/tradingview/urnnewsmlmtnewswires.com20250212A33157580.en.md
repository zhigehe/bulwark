Shopify reported strong fourth-quarter results and provided healthy guidance for the first quarter, notes Wedbush.

While first quarter guidance was in line with Wedbush estimates, the company's outlook implies that Y/Y revenue growth will decelerate to the mid 20s% range from the +31% Y/Y growth in the fourth quarter.

"We think the outlook for 1Q reflects some level of conservatism as management has a history of outperforming its guidance, having just delivered 4Q revenue growth above the high end of the prior outlook," Wedbush said.

Shopify is rated Outperform, with a US$140 target, at Wedbush.
