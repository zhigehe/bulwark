U.S. natural gas output and demand will both rise to record highs in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday.

EIA projected dry gas production will rise from 103.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2024 to 104.6 bcfd in 2025 and 107.3 bcfd in 2026. That compares with a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

The agency also projected domestic gas consumption would rise from a record 90.2 bcfd in 2024 to 90.7 bcfd in 2025 before easing back to 90.2 bcfd in 2026.
