New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.6% higher at 12989.18 as the benchmark index snapped a run of three weekly declines. Large-cap stocks and local shares of Australian banks finished higher on Friday, helping the NZX-50 add 0.7% over the week. It is now flat so far this month and 0.9% lower in 2025. The index spent all but a few minutes of Friday in positive territory, building on a strong lead by U.S. equities and finishing at a session high after New Zealand's manufacturing PMI moved into positive territory for the first time in almost two years. Medical-device maker Fisher & Paykel Healthcare was the best large-cap performer, adding 1.9%. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)
