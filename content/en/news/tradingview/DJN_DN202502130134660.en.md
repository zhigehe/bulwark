Wood products company West Fraser Timber wants to be smart about how it approaches tariffs, which includes being up to date with policy. On an analyst call, executives say the company is taking a number of actions to prepare for potential tariffs, including being "policy-current," and having multiple plans to adapt to any scenario, such as tit-for-tat tariffs. However, executives say they come from a position of strength thanks to a strong balance sheet and liquidity approaching C$1.7 billion that "provides a shock absorber for potential economic issues that may unfold in the face of looming tariffs and trade wars, while still allowing us to pursue cost improvement objectives and the return of surplus capital," they say.
