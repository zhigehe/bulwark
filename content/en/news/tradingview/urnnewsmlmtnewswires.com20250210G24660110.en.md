Chinese mobile phone makers are integrating DeepSeek's large language model into their smartphones, Yicai Global reported Monday.

ZTE's unit, Nubia Technology, is testing its Z70 Ultra model, which is among its models embedded with a full-scale DeepSeek system, the report said, citing Nubia's president, Ni Fei.

Huawei connected its HarmonyOS-based virtual assistant, Xiaoyi, to DeepSeek-R1, allowing users to communicate through the chatbot seamlessly, the report said.

Honor launched its pilot version of DeepSeek-R1 on Feb. 8, while Oppo is integrating DeepSeek-R1 into its Oppo Find N5, the report said.

Vivo and Xiaomi have not announced any plans with DeepSeek yet, Yicai said.
