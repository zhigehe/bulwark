Expectations for New Zealand inflation over the coming year have picked up slightly, rising to 2.15% from 2.05% previously, which follows a sharp fall in the New Zealand dollar in recent weeks that is set to push imported inflation higher for a period over the coming year, says Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at Westpac. Of more concern for the RBNZ are expectations over longer horizons, with the closely watched measure of expected inflation in two years' time edging down to 2.06% from 2.12% in the prior quarter, he adds. The survey will leave the RBNZ feeling comfortable that pricing behavior is well aligned with its medium-term inflation target, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)
