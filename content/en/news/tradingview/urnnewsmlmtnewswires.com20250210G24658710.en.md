Wellneo Sugar approved a tender offer for Toyo Sugar Refining , aiming to acquire all outstanding shares and make it a wholly owned subsidiary, according to a Monday filing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The company has agreed to buy Marubeni Corp.'s 39.3% stake and set a minimum acceptance threshold of 50.1% of voting rights.

If the offer falls short, Wellneo plans to secure additional shares through market purchases or other means to complete the privatization.
