Alibaba's cloud computing unit has embedded six more artificial intelligence models from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, the South China Morning Post reported Monday.

The development comes as the Hangzhou, China-based internet giant refuted rumors it is investing in the startup based in the same city, the SCMP reported.

DeepSeek's models are integrated into large language model service platform Bailian, offering one million free tokens for its full-strength V3 and R1 models, while selling the same amount of tokens for one of its distilled models at 0.5 yuan, the "lowest price on the market," the report said, citing a post on WeChat.
