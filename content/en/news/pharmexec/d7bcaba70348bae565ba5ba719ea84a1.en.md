The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) issued a response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The President recently placed tariffs on imports from China, including on pharmaceutical and technology products. China has stated that it will react with tariffs and export restrictions of its own, which will likely draw further response from the President.

According to President Trump, the tariffs are being put in place for several reasons. He plans on using the tariffs to improve the United States’ own manufacturing capabilities, draw better trade deals, and even prevent the influx of illegal drugs and immigrants from foreign countries. He has also announced plans to place tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, although those tariffs have not yet officially been put in place.

In a statement sent to *Pharmaceutical Executive*, AMCP CEO Susan A. Cantrell, MHL, RPh, CAE, said, “Although President Trump’s new and proposed tariffs aim to level the playing field between American industries and our foreign competitors, we are concerned about the unintended, adverse consequences they may have on the cost of medicines in the U.S.”

She continued, “Tariffs on China and other key countries in the global pharmaceutical supply chain could lead to increased costs for medicines, ultimately burdening U.S. patients and the health care system. Many critical medications and raw materials are sourced internationally, and imposing tariffs risks driving up prices, creating supply disruptions, and impeding patient access to essential treatments.”

The statement concludes, “With that in mind, we respectfully urge caution when instituting tariffs that may negatively impact prescription drug costs and potentially contribute to drug shortages. We ask the administration to consider exemptions for pharmaceutical products or deliberate implementation timelines in order to maintain efficient and affordable delivery to patients. That way, those patients who need these prescriptions the most are protected.”
