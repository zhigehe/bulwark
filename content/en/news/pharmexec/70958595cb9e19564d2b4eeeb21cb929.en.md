Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services.1

The US Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Kennedy on Thursday, February 13. The vote was mostly along party lines, with Mitch McConnell being the only Republican to vote against Kennedy.

During a confirmation process that became contentious at moments, Senate Democrats questioned Kennedy on a variety of his health stances, primarily focus was on the environmental lawyer's past statements regarding vaccines. Critics of the new HHS secretary claim that he is anti-vaccine, although Kennedy has denied this.

In order to secure the necessary votes, Kennedy made certain pledges to maintain existing government vaccine programs.2 This includes an ongoing promise to meet with Republican Senator Bill Cassidy multiple times a month, Reuters reports. Cassidy is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which voted to advance Kennedy’s nomination to the wider Senate earlier in February.

Kennedy’s nomination has drawn much interest from the pharmaceutical industry. The environmental lawyer has made multiple statements about the safety and efficacy of vaccines over the years. However, Kennedy has also made a variety of other health related statements, such as wanting to improve the quality of America’s food supply.

As Secretary of HHS, he will have authority over a variety of agencies, including FDA and the CDC. It’s unclear which areas Kennedy will focus on first, which has left many in the pharma industry uncertain about the industry’s regulatory future.

Aside from vaccines, Kennedy has also stated a desire to end DTC pharma advertising. Once again, it’s unclear when or if he will act on this intention.

Kennedy had initially run for President during the 2024 election, but eventually endorsed and campaigned for President Trump.
