The Jan. 27 order, titled “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness,” states, “Expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the **rigorous standards necessary** for Military Service.”    “**Effective immediately**, all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for Service members are paused,” Hegseth wrote.    The Department of Justice filed the memo as part of a lawsuit **challenging Trump’s order**. The plaintiffs [in that case](https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5110909-lgbtq-groups-sue-donald-trump-transgender-military-ban/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.10.25%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0Defense%20%26%20National%20Security), six transgender active-duty service members and two individuals seeking to enlist in the military, had requested the department notify them whenever the administration issued guidance on implementing the executive order.    DOJ identified **three additional memos** from the Navy, Air Force and Army directing recruiters to reject transgender applicants, and another memo from Hegseth dated Jan. 31 that instructs DoD to take steps to implement the order.    “Biological sex is **an immutable characteristic**,” Hegseth wrote in the Jan. 31 memo. “It is not fluid, and it cannot transform. Gender ideology denies this fundamental reality, and places women at risk by allowing biological males to gain access to intimate, single-sex spaces.”    **Two federal lawsuits** argue Trump’s executive order preventing transgender troops from serving is unconstitutional.    *Read the full report at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5136517-transgender-military-integration-medical-care-paused/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.10.25%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0Defense%20%26%20National%20Security).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Defense & National Security** newsletter, I’m Ellen Mitchell — your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
