President Trump on Friday signed an executive order to establish [a White House Faith Office](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5130103-trump-national-prayer-breakfast-religious-discrimination-task-force-anti-christian-bias/) in an effort to empower faith-based entities.

The office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and headed by a senior adviser tasked with consulting with various faith and community leaders in an effort to defend religious liberty and combat antisemitism, anti-Christianity and other anti-religious bias, according to the order.

The president announced the new office at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this week, saying that it would be led by the Rev. [Paula White,](https://thehill.com/people/paula-white/) who has served as a religious adviser to him for years.

In the order, Trump directed the office to identify ways to reduce burdens on the free exercise of religion and direct all federal agencies to designate a “faith liaison” within 90 days.

The office inside the White House would coordinate with attorney general Pam Bondi, who Trump earlier this week said would be named the head of [a task force](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5130103-trump-national-prayer-breakfast-religious-discrimination-task-force-anti-christian-bias/) to “eradicate anti-Christian bias.”

The office will also advise on policies that can enable faith-based entities, coordinate with other agencies on training and education for faith-based entities to procure grants and support agencies in development training on religious liberty exceptions and accommodations.

Additionally, it will be tasked with consulting with private businesses on charitable giving and payroll deductions while also coordinating with agencies on promoting grant opportunities for non-profit faith-based entities.
