Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) introduced a new bill this week aiming to rename Greenland to “Red, White, and Blueland,” as President Trump [seeks to acquire](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5074900-trump-provokes-anxieties-with-greenland-panama-canal-military-talk/) the island territory.

The legislation, called the “[Red, White, and Blueland Act of 2025](https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=15398),” directs [Interior Secretary](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5117068-senate-confirms-doug-burgum-interior-secretary/) Doug Burgum to oversee the implementation of the name change and to ensure official documentation and maps refer to Greenland by its updated name.

The legislation also authorizes President Trump to [enter into negotiations](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5097789-trump-greenland-international-security/) with Denmark “to purchase or otherwise acquire Greenland.”

“America is back and will soon be bigger than ever with the addition of Red, White, and Blueland,” Carter said in a statement Tuesday, after introducing the legislation.

“President Trump has correctly identified the purchase of what is now Greenland as a national security priority, and we will proudly welcome its people to join the freest nation to ever exist when our Negotiator-in-Chief inks this monumental deal,” he added.

Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in [purchasing Greenland](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5072757-trump-second-term-imperialism/), a semi-autonomous country that is currently under Denmark’s control. He has argued that the U.S. taking over the Arctic island [is necessary](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5053319-trump-greenland-purchase/) for national security purposes.

During his inauguration speech, Trump referred to the U.S. as a growing nation [expanding its territory](https://thehill.com/homenews/5080121-trump-expansion-greenland-canada-panama-leaders/). He [has also called](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5058013-trump-purchase-canada-panama-canal/) for the U.S. to retake the Panama Canal and mused about annexing Canada.

Greenland and Denmark have emphatically [resisted Trump’s push](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5091212-greenland-donald-trump-expansion-proposal/) to acquire the country.

“We don’t want to be Danes,” Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte Egede previously said on Fox News. “We don’t even want to be Americans. We want to be Greenlanders.”

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also insisted Greenland is not for sale and that it is up to Greenland to make its decision about its independence.
