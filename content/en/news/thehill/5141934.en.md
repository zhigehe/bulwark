Ed Markey (D) and Elizabeth Warren (D), **expressed alarm** that Musk and his DOGE team gained access to sensitive payment and contracting systems at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).    “Masquerading as a false crusade against waste, fraud, and abuse, Musk appears intent to break the programs that seniors, people with disabilities, children, and families rely on to get their health care,” the senators wrote in the letter, which was **shared first with The Hill**.    Last week, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) **accessed systems** at CMS in its far-reaching quest to uncover examples of waste, fraud and abuse.    In a [post on](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1889198569518719122?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CMS%202.12%20Health) [X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1889198569518719122?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CMS%202.12%20Health), Musk, who owns the social media platform, said he believes the amount of **fraud** in federal entitlement programs “exceeds the combined sum of every private scam.”    But ending fraud, waste and abuse is a focus of every federal agency, and, to date, DOGE has focused on **slashing staff** and spending seemingly indiscriminately, without concern for consequences.    “We write to say no to Elon Musk and DOGE, and demand hands off Medicare and Medicaid,” lawmakers wrote in the letter. “We strongly oppose any efforts by Musk—or anyone else in your administration—cutting or damaging these vital programs. Medicare and Medicaid must not be raided to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.”    Medicaid is a **prime** **target** for Republicans, who see it as a program rife with fraud and abuse and have long sought to rein in its spending.    The joint federal and state-funded program provides health coverage to more than **72 million** low-income Americans.    The Democrats’ letter comes as a budget blueprint from House Republicans called for the Energy and Commerce Committee to find **$880 billion** in savings. The bulk of those savings will likely come from Medicaid changes. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Health Care newsletter**, we’re Nathaniel Weixel, Joseph Choi and Alejandra O’Connell-Domenech — every week we follow the latest moves on how Washington impacts your health. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
