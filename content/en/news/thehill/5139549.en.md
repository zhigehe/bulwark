Trump [quickly signed](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-trump-signs-executive-order-on-developing-artificial-intelligence-free-from-ideological-bias-2/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025) an executive order to roll back any policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation” just days after taking office.    Coupled with Vance’s remarks, the Trump administration is signaling a **growing disagreement with Europe** over how to handle the emerging tech.    Questions have long swirled over how the U.S. should balance AI innovation and regulation.    The Trump administration has so far prioritized AI innovation in a more **hands-off approach,** contrasting with Europe, which has largely tightened regulations over safety and responsibility concerns.    “The Trump administration believes that AI will have countless revolutionary applications and economic innovation, job creation, national security, health care, free expression and beyond,” Vance said.    “And to restrict its development now will not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies that we have seen in generations.”    *Read more in a full report at **[TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5137834-trump-administration-ai-regulation/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025)*** | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Technology newsletter**, we’re Julia Shapero and Miranda Nazzaro — tracking the latest moves from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?

The agency joined crypto exchange **Binance**, which it sued in 2023 for alleged securities violations, in asking a federal judge Monday to put their case on hold for the time being.    They pointed to the SEC’s newly established **crypto task force**, which they suggested “may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.”    The SEC is also scaling back a unit of more than 50 lawyers and staff dedicated to crypto enforcement and reassigning some to other departments, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/sec-crypto-task-force.html?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025).    This shift was widely expected, although questions have remained about what changes exactly the agency would implement amid the pro-crypto shift.    After embracing the industry during his 2024 campaign, President Trump has tapped several crypto-friendly figures to serve in his administration, including **Paul Atkins**, his pick to lead the SEC.    Atkins is still awaiting Senate confirmation. In the meantime, Republican commissioner **Mark Uyeda**, who has criticized the agency’s previous approach to crypto, is serving as acting chair. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **The Refresh** | | --- |  | *News we’ve flagged from**t**he intersection of tech and other topics:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | * Thompson Reuters wins first major AI copyright case in U.S. ([WIRED)](https://www.wired.com/story/thomson-reuters-ai-copyright-lawsuit/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025) * BuzzFeed to launch new social media platform ‘BF Island’ ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/buzzfeed-social-media-app-island?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025)) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **In Other News** | | --- |  | *Branch out with other reads on The Hill:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | [I'm an image](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5136612-deepseek-banned-from-ny-state-government-devices/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Tech%20newsletter%2002.11.2025) | | --- |  | **DeepSeek banned from NY state government devices** | | --- |  | New York State is prohibiting the China-based artificial intelligence application DeepSeek from government devices.
