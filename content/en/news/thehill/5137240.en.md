He also pledged shortly after Election Day that his political action committee would “play a significant role in primaries” next year.    At the time, the threat was seen as mostly aimed at rebellious House conservatives who loomed as an obstacle to reelecting **Speaker Mike Johnson** (R-La.) and threatened to derail Trump’s tax agenda by insisting on major spending cuts.    But Republican senators have taken Musk’s warning to heart.    “That’s one of the reasons why you see people who are close to an election —**Bill Cassidy, Thom Tillis** — voting for certain nominees,” said one Republican senator who requested anonymity to discuss the recent votes of GOP colleagues, including Louisiana’s Cassidy and North Carolina’s Tillis.    “The White House hasn’t been too subtle about that. I think they’ve been fairly threatening,” the lawmaker added, noting Cassidy already faces a primary challenge from Louisiana state Treasurer **John Fleming.**    *The Hill’s Alexander Bolton has more at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133777-elon-musk-threatens-republican-senators/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.10%20Tech%20Newsletter%20MN).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Technology newsletter**, we’re Julia Shapero and Miranda Nazzaro — tracking the latest moves from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
