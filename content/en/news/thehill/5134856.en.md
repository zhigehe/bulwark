(NEXSTAR) — We’re still a few hours out from Super Bowl LIX, but the commercials set to air between the action are already catching attention.

More than 120 million viewers are expected to tune in to the game Sunday and companies are paying top-dollar to make sure their brand is seen by the millions of watching eyes.

Demand for ad space was robust this year, said Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, with ad space selling out in November and a waitlist for marketers ready to take the space of anyone who pulled out.

The high demand seems to have pushed prices to a record, with a few ad spots reportedly selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Fox declined to comment on the specific price tag for 30 seconds, which can vary depending on placement and other factors. But in an earnings call in November, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said ad space had sold out at “record pricing.” Last year, a 30-second spot went for around a reported $7 million.

Even the Secret Service is reportedly getting in on the advertising action. [CNN reported](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/politics/secret-service-super-bowl-ad/index.html) the agency will be airing a recruitment ad during the Super Bowl.

Despite those hefty price tags, some companies released their ads well before the game kicked off. Here are some of the most talked about commercials from this year’s Super Bowl.

Vehicles
--------

### Ram

While automakers are mainly sitting out of the Super Bowl commercial game this year, Ram turned to actor Glenn Powell for a Goldilocks — sorry, “rugged, woodsy dude” take on its trucks. You can watch the fairytale-ish commercial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9ot1x4oEaQ).

Entertainment
-------------

### Disney

Unlike Ram’s fairytale-like ad, Disney is inviting viewers to imagine a world without its magical stories and characters in its Super Bowl LIX commercial, [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8May3405b_o). Featuring beloved animated features, storied franchises, award-winning shows, and its live sports offering via Disney family member ESPN, the commercial first questions you about the “what ifs” before reminding you these shows, films, and sports can be viewed on Disney’s streaming services.

Beer
----

### Budweiser

The beer brand is once again relying on its beloved Clydesdales for its Big Game ad spot. This year, an ambitious foal makes its “first delivery.” You can see the ad before the Super Bowl by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0iKgJXy_gk).

### Michelob Ultra

Another brand under the Anheuser-Busch umbrella tapped Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara for its commercial. The beloved actors play pickleball hustlers in this spot. While you may be familiar with the sport that has been sweeping the nation, Dafoe told the Associated Press that he was unfamiliar with “this phenomenon of pickleball” until this job. You can see “The ULTRA Hustle” [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAJW_-i4-kc).

### Stella Artois

David Beckham has long been the face of Stella Artois, but it turns out someone else may have his face — at least according to the ad. The teaser features Beckham learning from his parents (not his actual parents) that he has a twin, named Other David, that he never knew about. You’ll have to wait until Super Bowl Sunday to meet Other David, but you can watch the teaser now by [clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYB3nJ9HfQk).

### Bud Light

Sticking with the beer commercials for a moment, you can catch comedian Shane Gillis, singer Post Malone, and hall of fame quarterback Peyton Manning serving as the “Big Men on Cul-de-Sac.” We can’t launch a Bud Light into your kitchen (spoiler alert), but we can direct you to the ad, seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbswwBCDo).

### Coors Light

OK, one more beer commercial won’t hurt, right? Playing into [its promotional gaffe and temporary name change](https://www.wjhl.com/news/coors-light-is-temporarily-changing-its-name-heres-why/), Coors Light is using its Super Bowl ad spot to highlight how viewers will likely feel on the Monday after the big game. [See it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTj2BH0qJjU).

Food

### Hellmann’s

When Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal starred in “When Harry Met Sally” in 1989, they likely didn’t think it would be Hellmann’s mayonnaise that would reunite them in 2025. They may, however, have been able to guess a certain scene in a deli would come back to haunt (or maybe highlight?) them again. You can [see that commercial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX9qfSEKyuc) — but maybe make sure you’re wearing headphones first, if you’re in public.

### Häagen-Dazs

“Fast and Furious” fans may enjoy Häagen-Dazs’ Super Bowl commercial, featuring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Ludacris. You can see the “not so fast” ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTppVzG8gpU).

### Nerds

The small, rainbow-colored candies are taking on the Big Game with a New Orleans-inspired ad featuring singer Shaboozey, well-known for his chart-topping song “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” It’s not that song that Shaboozey performs during the commercial — instead, he sings a bit of “What a Wonderful World” by New Orleans native Louis Armstrong. You can see the ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwcZ2dxPUo0).

### Ritz

Two of the saltiest actors you may know, Aubrey Plaza and Michael Shannon, seem to break the salty mold after enjoying some buttery, salty Ritz crackers at the Salty Club, located on the Salt Flats of Utah. They’re joined by the seemingly unsalty music artist Bad Bunny for the Ritz Super Bowl commercial, [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjINFAdmhI).

### Oikos Yogurt

Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns (the team he has since requested a trade from) may have missed out on the Big Game this year, but he didn’t miss his chance to star in a commercial. He was joined by actor Juno Temple, well-known for her role in “Ted Lasso,” in an Oikos Yogurt ad that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-LCyj_-hRU).

### Taco Bell

In another apparent teaser, rapper Doja Cat photobombs a drive-thru camera at a Taco Bell, only to be immediately scolded for it. According to the ad, the full Super Bowl commercial will feature actual photos from actual Taco Bell drive-thru cameras — so if you’ve been through one recently, you may want to tune in to the game on Sunday. Until then, you can catch the teaser released by Taco Bell in the video player below.

### Little Caesars

The “pizza pizza” chain tapped actor Eugene Levy — or maybe more appropriately, his eyebrows — for a spot teasing their Crazy Puffs. You’ll even catch a cameo by his daughter, Sarah Levy, when you watch the ad, [seen here](https://youtu.be/KPeAKY73c10).

### Pringles

They’re not Eugene Levy’s eyebrows, but there is some facial hair featured in [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-nGdi_3_o) from Pringles. In it, actor Adam Brody blows into an empty can of Pringles, calling some famous mustaches — those belonging to actor Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, L.A. Clippers’ James Harden, and Mr. Potato Head — to a Pringles-less party.

### Totinos Pizza Rolls

You know them from “Detroiters” and “I Think You Should Leave,” but now you’ll recognize Sam Richardson and Tim Robinson from the Super Bowl commercial in which a pizza rolls-holding alien dies. You can see that strange moment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIYkPHUiCW4).

Tech

### Uber Eats

While it doesn’t appear that we have the full commercial yet, Uber Eats has dropped a worthwhile 30-second clip of what is sure to be a talked-about ad. In it, Martha Stewart and Charli XCX take on a new social media trend in which “we listen and we don’t judge” — you can watch the ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jJckmvAp70) and then be the judge of its viral-ness.

### Meta

A trio of Chrises — Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner — have teamed up for a Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses ad in which they’re all wearing said glasses. Pratt observes the now-iconic duct tape banana, which Hemsworth then eats, ultimately prompting a scolding from Jenner. You can see the ad, regardless of whether you’re wearing Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cqwXxUo_q8).

Serious messages
----------------

### Dove

The spot, highlights the problem of low body confidence in young girls, depicts a young girl running down the sidewalk to H.E.R.’s version of “Born to Run.” You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IxFsKqxLRA).

### Foundation to Combat Antisemitism

Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady appear in the ad, trading reasons why people hate each other in an effort to combat hate speech. This is the second year the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, has run a Super Bowl ad, which you can [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOxm8LmH7Y4).

### Hims & Hers

The Hims & Hers company, Telehealth, is debuting its first Super Bowl ad, which highlights the obesity epidemic and says weight loss drugs should be more affordable. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l6QMNnqoc).

### Novartis

Also running its first Big Game ad is Novartis, tapping actors Wanda Sykes and Hailee Steinfeld (who is engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen) for a commercial focusing on breast cancer awareness. You can watch a teaser [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_-AqDbYOtM&t=1s).

### Pfizer

Featuring a young boy apparently geared up to knock out cancer, Pfizer will air a commercial highlighting its efforts to fight for eight cancer breakthroughs by 2030. You can see the full ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNLhMZuA00c).

There are also some nonexistent ads that have caught attention. State Farm pulled out of its planned advertising to focus on the devastating California wildfires. Another traditionally big category for the Super Bowl, automakers, are mainly sitting it out after a tough year in the sector, with only Stellantis’ Jeep and Ram brands having announced an appearance.

Dunkin’ has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn’t given any other details.
