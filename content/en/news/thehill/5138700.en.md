A California teenager was sentenced to 48 months in prison on Tuesday following a series of [interstate threats](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4990669-teen-pleads-guilty-swatting-calls-doj/) to injure individuals across the country.

Alan W. Filion, 18, of Lancaster, Calif., made over 375 swatting and threat calls to the authorities in which he claimed to have planted bombs in the targeted locations, threatened to detonate bombs or conduct mass shootings at those locations between August 2022 and January 2024, according to the plea agreement.

He is said to have targeted religious institutions, high schools, colleges and universities as well as government officials and numerous individuals across the U.S.

Filion said some of the calls were self motivated and that he was paid for other instances, the Department of Justice.

The teenager was arrested in California on Florida state charges in late January following a May 2023 threat he made to a religious institution in Sanford, Fla., where he claimed to have an illegally modified AR-15, a Glock 17 pistol, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails.

Filion said that he was going to imminently “commit a mass shooting” and “kill everyone” he saw. He pleaded guilty in federal court to making that threat.

He’s pleaded guilty to several other similar crimes in Washington, Texas and Florida.
