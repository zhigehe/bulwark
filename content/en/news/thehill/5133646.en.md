Presented by Becker & Poliakoff ‚Äî President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson will attend the game Sunday as unruly House Republicans squabble over spending{beacon}

It‚Äôs a high-stakes, intra-party battle for control, with Trump‚Äôs legislative agenda hanging in the balance.    It begins tonight. Senate Republicans are [headed to Mar-a-Lago](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132110-speaker-johnson-house-lawmakers-to-work-through-weekend-amid-trump-agenda-stalemate/) to huddle with Trump. House Republicans will work through the weekend ‚Äî [including on Super Bowl Sunday](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132110-speaker-johnson-house-lawmakers-to-work-through-weekend-amid-trump-agenda-stalemate/) ‚Äî as they seek to maintain control of the process.    Additional details could be revealed in Trump‚Äôs interview with Fox News Channel‚Äôs **Bret Baier**, which will air during the game.    **Here‚Äôs the latest:**    **‚Ä¢** Johnson and House Republicans were supposed to have already released a blueprint for ‚Äúone big, beautiful‚Äù bill that extends Trump‚Äôs tax cuts, addresses the debt ceiling and allocates new spending for Trump‚Äôs priorities, including border security.    But conservative fiscal hawks want to see **trillions more in cuts** than Johnson is offering, citing the national debt as their primary concern.    The extension of the Trump tax cuts would reduce government revenue by somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 trillion annually, [according to](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/trump-tax-priorities-total-5-11-trillion) the **Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget**.    Johnson says House Republicans made some progress Thursday at a five-hour closed door meeting. He says the House blueprint could come Sunday or Monday.    Johnson blamed Democrats for the stalemate, [eliciting outrage](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5133390-top-house-democrats-push-back-against-republican-accusations/) from Democratic leaders who say they‚Äôve been trying to get Republicans to negotiate for weeks.    *‚ÄúHe‚Äôs full of s‚Äë‚Äë‚Äë,‚Äù* [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5133390-top-house-democrats-push-back-against-republican-accusations/) Rep. **Jim McGovern** (D-Mass.). | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **SENATE MAKES ITS MOVE** | | --- |  | Senate Republicans are tired of waiting, with the clock ticking toward a March 14 government shutdown.    While the budget traditionally originates in the House, Senate Budget Committee Chair **Lindsey Graham** (R-S.C.) says the upper chamber will take the lead on a two-bill strategy.    Graham unveiled a 61-page budget resolution on Friday and planned a mark-up for next week.    The Hill‚Äôs **Alexander Bolton** [has the details](https://thehill.com/business/5133363-senate-bill-border-defense-energy/): *‚ÄúThe resolution includes $175 billion to secure the southern border and $150 billion to beef up national defense‚Ä¶If the Senate and House adopt the resolution‚Ä¶it would allow Senate Majority Leader **John Thune**(R-S.D.) to bring a reconciliation package to the Senate floor‚Ä¶ immune from a Democratic filibuster.‚Äù*    GOP senators will [press Trump to side with them](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5131694-republicans-trump-budget-reconciliation/) when they huddle with the president at Mar-a-Lago this evening.    Johnson is feeling the squeeze.    *‚ÄúOur message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is: Allow the House to do its work,‚Äù* he said.    The Hill‚Äôs **Mychael Schnell** reported Johnson said he‚Äôs been playing [‚Äúphone tag‚Äù](https://x.com/mychaelschnell/status/1887896430444183964) with Graham for the last 36 hours.    *‚ÄúI sent him a text message earlier this morning and explained where we are in the process and how it‚Äôs moving aggressively and how important it is for the House to be the one that leads on this and so I expect I‚Äôll talk with him today,‚Äù* Johnson said. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **üí°*Perspectives****:*  **‚Ä¢** [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5128995-american-manufacturing-struggling-tariffs/): Tariffs won‚Äôt bring back American manufacturing.  **‚Ä¢** [Freddie DeBoer](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/we-have-to-take-some-kind-of-an-l?): Liberals must accept the loss on immigration.  **‚Ä¢** [USA Today](//www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/02/07/democrats-protest-trump-democratic-party-unpopular/78216909007/): Trump just getting started on what voters want.  **‚Ä¢** [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5130576-trump-imperial-presidency-threat/): Who will stand up to Trump‚Äôs un-American rule by decree?  **‚Ä¢** [The Liberal Patriot](https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/the-democrats-voter-registration?): The Democrats‚Äô voter registration blues. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | ***Read more:***  **‚Ä¢** House Republicans [pass fentanyl bill](https://thehill.com/homenews/5131950-house-republicans-pass-fentanyl-bill-with-democratic-support/?tbref=hp) with Democratic support.  **‚Ä¢** Cook Political Report unveils [18 toss-up House races](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5130655-cook-political-report-democrats-republicans/?tbref=hp) for 2026. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | CATCH UP QUICK | | --- |  | * **The U.S. added 143,000 jobs** during former President Biden‚Äôs [final month in office](https://thehill.com/business/5132310-us-added-143k-jobs-in-bidens-last-month-as-president/), which was [lower than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/jobs-report-january-2025.html).

Trump alleged that ‚Äúmany NGOs are engaged in actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.‚Äù    The Hill‚Äôs **Julia Mueller** [reports](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5132625-trump-review-federal-funding-ngos/): *‚ÄúThe broad announcement did not name specific NGOs. According*[*to the State Department,*](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/releases/2025/01/non-governmental-organizations-ngos-in-the-united-states)*there are some 1.5 million such advocacy and service groups operating in the United States, focusing on social and economic issues including elections, healthcare and women‚Äôs rights, among many others.‚Äù*    This comes as **Elon Musk**‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its offensive against the federal workforce.    Early on, it appeared some Democrats would be on board with the effort to root out government waste. Instead, Democrats now see Musk as a villain for the provocative and brute manner in which he‚Äôs gone about his business.    Rep. **Val Hoyle** (D-Ore.) told NewsNation‚Äôs **Chris Cuomo** that she‚Äôs leaving the House DOGE caucus to protest what she described as [Musk‚Äôs belligerence](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132271-val-hoyle-democrat-house-doge-caucus/).    *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how we can do this work when Elon Musk is blowing things up,‚Äù* she said. *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like trying to replace your roof when someone is throwing dynamite through the window into your living room.‚Äù*    Trump gave Musk a vote of confidence on Friday.    *‚ÄúElon is doing a great job,‚Äù* he said. *‚ÄúHe‚Äôs finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste. You see it with the USAID, but you‚Äôre going to see it even more so with other agencies and other parts of government.‚Äù*    **The latest:**    **‚Ä¢** The House Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a [hearing next week](https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5131710-trump-administration-slashing-usaid-reports/?tbref=hp) on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) amid Musk‚Äôs plans to reduce the workforce from about 14,000 to 300.
