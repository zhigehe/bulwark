(üì∏ [**The cover**](https://x.com/TIME/status/1887849588104548502)**)**He also shared a photo of himself sporting a comically big MAGA hat while standing in the Oval Office. (üì∏ [**Elon in the giant MAGA hat**](https://nypost.com/2025/02/07/us-news/elon-musk-shares-oval-office-photo-of-him-in-massive-maga-hat/)**)**    **And so is DOGE**: Trump is using Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to try to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has his eyes set on the Department of Education next. He‚Äôs also targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and foreign aid. His team has gained access to some government agency‚Äôs internal systems, one of which includes sensitive tax information for Americans. Musk claims his effort has already saved more than $1 billion. [**More on what DOGE has done so far**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-doge-elon-musk-findings-trump/)    **Democrats are obviously livid**: Democrats have struggled to find their footing to combat Trump‚Äôs barrage of changes in his second administration. But witnessing Musk‚Äôs seemingly unchecked power has helped them rally in opposition. Democrats are trying to characterize him as a boogeyman, with some in the party pointing to the fact that he‚Äôs a [high-profile billionaire who is erratic](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5131567-democrats-target-musk/) and out of touch with most Americans.    The Hill‚Äôs **Amie Parnes** [reports](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5131567-democrats-target-musk/) how Musk has provoked a battle among Democrats over how to fight back. It‚Äôs worth reading.    **Keep in mind**: Democratic Rep. **Ro Khanna** (Calif.) did acknowledge Musk will likely find ‚Äúawful examples‚Äù of wasteful government spending, but it‚Äôs the magnitude and speed of changes that‚Äôs worrying some.    **How are Republicans feeling about Musk?**: Trump has such a grip on the Republican Party that he is not receiving much internal pushback. They‚Äôre generally happy about the spending cuts that would come with DOGE. Even some [red states are trying to implement](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5131393-republicans-state-governments-cost-cutting/) their own DOGE-style slashes.    **But there‚Äôs a limit**: Republicans are uncomfortable with the scope of Musk‚Äôs power. Some Senate Republicans [are questioning the basis](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5126740-elon-musk-government-authority/) of his authority. Plus, [recent polling shows](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129353-gop-support-for-musk-influence-with-trump-falls-dramatically-poll/) that Republican voters are uneasy with some of the changes.    üí°**Why Musk is prompting such a visceral reaction:** He‚Äôs an unelected adviser with little familiarity with Washington politics. While many in the MAGA movement specifically appreciate his outside perspective and ability to buck political norms, that experience should also come with an understanding of the factors and countless challenges involved in governing.    **What‚Äôs keeping lawmakers up at night:** Musk is singlehandedly trying to dismantle government agencies. Many in Washington are wondering if he has the power to do so, and lawmakers are also concerned his actions could pose a threat to Congress‚Äôs power of the purse. He‚Äôs been handed a top-secret security clearance, but questions remain over full vetting for his team and the broader ramifications of their actions.  **Related, via NBC News:** [**‚ÄòSecrecy is becoming a defining trait of Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE‚Äô**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/secrecy-becoming-defining-characteristic-elon-musks-doge-rcna190966) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | **Oh yeah, hey JD!:** | | --- |  | Elon Musk has been attracting so much attention as Trump‚Äôs deputy that **Vice President Vance** has not been in the spotlight as much. Well, Trump just handled him a whopper of a project: Save TikTok.    Vance has been tapped to handle the potential sale of the TikTok social media app. If no deal is reached by April, the popular app will be banned. National security adviser **Mike Waltz** will also help.    **üí°** **Why this matters**: Presidents often hand over a particularly tough project to their vice presidents to spearhead. Remember how former **President Biden** tasked former **Vice President Kamala Harris** with working on the U.S.-Mexico border issue? üòÖ This is high stakes. More than 170 million Americans use the app, but facilitating a potential sale over the next two months will be a heavy lift.    FWIW, Vance has experience in this area. He is a former venture capitalist and was involved in social media investments (like the YouTube alternative Rumble.) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | **üì∞** **News This Morning** | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Biden‚Äôs last jobs report**: | | --- |  | The U.S. economy [added 143,000 jobs in January](https://thehill.com/business/5132310-us-added-143k-jobs-in-bidens-last-month-as-president/?tbref=hp), roughly in line with economists‚Äô expectations. The unemployment rate fell to 4 percent.    **What economists had expected**: A job gain of roughly 170,000 and a jobless rate of 4.1 percent. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | **ü•ä** **On Capitol Hill** | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Who will be the favorite child?**: | | --- |  | There‚Äôs a standoff brewing on Capitol Hill, and, shockingly, it‚Äôs not Republicans vs. Democrats ‚Äî it‚Äôs the House GOP vs. Senate GOP.    House Republicans want **President Trump**‚Äôs priorities to be balled together into ‚Äú[one big, beautiful bill.‚Äù](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5068196-johnson-says-he-expects-to-pass-most-of-trumps-agenda-with-one-big-beautiful-bill-by-memorial-day/)¬†Senate Republicans want them to be split into two bills ‚Äî knock out the easy stuff now and then work on the trickier proposals.    **What does Trump think?**: He‚Äôs letting both sides make their case.    **House Republicans had their chance to woo Trump**: The caucus met with Trump at the White House yesterday for several hours. | | --- |  | **And now, the Senate has a chance to work its magic**: Trump [invited Senate Republicans to a private dinner](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5131694-republicans-trump-budget-reconciliation/) this evening at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The dinner is an extended opportunity for senators to chat with Trump. Senators are expected to dress up. They‚Äôre staying at The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach and will be picked up for the dinner. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | **üêù**¬†Internet Buzz | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **üçù** **Celebrate**: Today is **National Fettuccine Alfredo Day!** And while that deserves proper appreciation, Sunday is **National Pizza Day!** **üçï**Perfect for the Super Bowl.    **‚òï** **Free coffee at Starbucks**: Starbucks is [offering a free hot or iced brewed coffee](https://mashable.com/article/feb-7-free-starbucks-deal) on Monday, the day after the Super Bowl. **The fine print**: You must be a rewards member.    **üê∂** **Walter, you have my vote**: A 10-year-old golden retriever named Walter has entered the race for honorary mayor of Dorchester, Mass., [per the Dorchester Report](https://www.dotnews.com/2025/first-ever-caninedacy-mayor-dorchester). üì∏ [**Walter looking mayoral**](https://www.dotnews.com/2025/first-ever-caninedacy-mayor-dorchester) | | --- |  | üìÜ On The Agenda | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | The House [met this morning](https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/default.aspx).
