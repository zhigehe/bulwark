President Trump on Sunday said that he has revoked the security clearances of people he doesn’t respect, days after he said he would end former President Biden’s security clearance.

“There are people that we don’t respect, if there are people that we thought that were breaking the law, that came very close to it in previous years, we do it. And we’ve done it with some people,” the president told reporters.

He was asked about his reasoning for yanking the clearance of New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump has also revoked the clearances of former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and [announced on Friday](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133854-trump-biden-security-clearance-revoked/) he would revoke Biden’s clearance.

“We’ve done it with Biden himself. Biden himself. We think our country is not as safe when you gave him clearance,” Trump added on Sunday. “We don’t think he knows what he’s doing and what he’s done to this country is a disgrace, and what he’s done in terms of allowing criminals, murderers, drug lords into our country, people from mental institutions into our country, he should be ashamed of himself.”

The president had argued that there is no need for Biden to receive a security clearance and aimed to stop him from receiving daily intelligence briefings. He had referenced special counsel [Robert Hur’s](https://thehill.com/people/robert-hur/)2024 [report](https://thehill.com/homenews/4525955-biden-hur-transcript-special-counsel-classified-documents-report/), which offered insights into Biden’s handling of classified materials.

Trump also [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5098612-john-bolton-donald-trump-secret-service/) the Secret Service protection for his former national security adviser John Bolton last month and pulled security protection for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, The Hill [reported](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5103558-trump-security-pompeo-hook-bolton/).
