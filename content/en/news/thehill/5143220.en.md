A U.S. aircraft carrier collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday, a U.S. Navy spokesperson said Thursday.

The collision occurred between the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) and the merchant vessel Besiktas-M, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Timothy Gorman, a spokesperson for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.

The ships collided in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt, at approximately 11:46 p.m. local time, Gorman said. There were no reported injuries or flooding on the Navy aircraft carrier and its propulsion plants “are unaffected and in a safe and stable condition,” Gorman said.

The incident is currently under investigation, Gorman said, and officials will continue to release information as they learn more.
