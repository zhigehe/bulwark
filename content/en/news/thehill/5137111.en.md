Democratic attorneys general in **22 states** and Washington, D.C., who challenged the freeze said the Trump administration was not complying with the judge’s initial command.    The judge said withheld funds that must be restored include those appropriated under two laws championed by former President Biden — the **Inflation Reduction Act** and **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act** — and those intended for institutes and other agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH).    In a memo last month, the Office of Management and Budget directed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of grants while the administration assessed its spending to assure it aligned with Trump’s agenda, sparking legal challenges and widespread confusion.    Though the memo was later withdrawn, McConnell said the reversal was “in name only” after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt specified on social media that the administration’s rescission only referred to the memo itself, not the entire freeze.    The rescission “may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts. The substantive effect of the directive carries on,” McConnell, an appointee of former President Obama, wrote in his previous order.    The Justice Department has [appealed the judge’s order](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5136833-trump-administration-appeals-order-federal-grants-freeze/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.10.25%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL%20JB).

In the House, Speaker **Mike Johnson** (R-La.) and Republicans are vowing to keep working on a budget resolution to advance Trump’s priorities **in a single bill**, despite such an agreement eluding them for days.    The chamber is set to blow through another self-imposed deadline as lawmakers remain at odds over key issues.    **In the Senate,** meanwhile, top Republicans are moving on an effort to advance Trump’s agenda in **two separate bills**, as the conference grows impatient with the House’s lack of progress.    The chamber vs. chamber battle comes as GOP lawmakers are eager to enact items on Trump’s wish list, but remain in disagreement over the best strategy to do so — with neither side willing to back down.
