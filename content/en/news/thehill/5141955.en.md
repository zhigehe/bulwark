She repeatedly said Musk should **testify under oath** before the panel.    But Republicans on the subcommittee, which is chaired by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), **fiercely defended** Musk’s actions even in the wake of federal judges attempting to stop some of them.    Greene said a ruling blocking DOGE from accessing the Treasury Department’s payment systems was “absurd.”    And Greene issued a warning: “We will hold this judge and others who try to stop the will of the people and their elected leaders accountable.”    The hearing also got into some discussion of the technicalities of **improper payments**.    Witness Haywood Talcove, the CEO for Government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, estimated that implementing front-end identity verification, eliminating self-certification and monitoring the back end of the programs could save $1 trillion annually across federal, state and local governments. That, he said, could take a fraud rating of around 20 percent to around 5 percent.    “The gravy train for a lot of these folks, it’s been on biscuit wheels and it’s about to run off the dadgum tracks,” quipped Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.).

| | --- |  | **GOP looks to accounting tactics to address costs of agenda** | | --- |  | Republicans are trying to make budget cuts in order to help pay for their tax agenda, core elements of which would cost as much as **$4.7 trillion** over the next decade, or about as much revenue as the government collects in a year.    But due to the difficulty of passing budget cuts, GOP lawmakers are also considering some **special accounting** to help lower the price tag. These methods are known as dynamic scoring and working from the policy baseline.    Dynamic scoring means factoring in presumed economic growth resulting from tax cuts, and using the policy baseline means ignoring revenue losses that would show up if current tax rates are considered to be expiring at the end of this year, as is current law.    “The current policy baseline is current law,” Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) told reporters Tuesday.    Neither dynamic scoring nor the policy baseline constitute standard accounting as far as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official legislative scoring body, is concerned.    Tax experts have told The Hill that dynamic scoring is especially not at play in the current tax debate, since most of what’s being extended is rate reductions for individuals as opposed to corporate deductions, which can spur production increases in the economy.    The corporate rate was reduced on a permanent basis from 35 to 21 percent in 2017, though President Trump has signaled interest in getting it down to **15 percent**.    *—  Tobias Burns* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  {{if !contains(profile.lists,”Evening Report”)}  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  {/if}}{{if !contains(profile.lists,”Evening Report”)}  | | | COMING UP | | --- |  | *The Hill’s **Evening Report** breaks down the day’s big political stories and looks ahead to tomorrow. **[Click here to sign up & get it in your inbox](https://cb.sailthru.com/join/7aa/cross-promo-signup-confirm?sailthru_vars%5Bcross_promo_signup_evening_report%5D=1&sailthru_lists%5BEvening%20Report%5D=1&email=email&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH)*** | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  {/if}}  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **The Ticker** | | --- |  | *Upcoming news themes and events we’re watching:* | | --- |  | * The producer price index (PPI) for **January** comes out Thursday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **In Other News** | | --- |  | *Branch out with more stories from the day:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | [I'm an image](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-texas-county-approves-holding-election-to-make-spacexs-starbase-its-own-city/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH) | | --- |  | **[Texas county approves holding election to make SpaceX’s Starbase its own city](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-texas-county-approves-holding-election-to-make-spacexs-starbase-its-own-city/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH)** | | --- |  | McALLEN, Texas (AP) — A Texas county on Wednesday approved holding an election sought by SpaceX that … | | --- |  | [Full Story](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-texas-county-approves-holding-election-to-make-spacexs-starbase-its-own-city/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **Good to Know** | | --- |  | *Business and economic news we’ve flagged from other outlets:* | | --- |  | * Hopes for more Fed rate cuts dim as Powell notes hot CPI means ‘we’re not quite there yet’ ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/hopes-for-more-fed-rate-cuts-dim-as-powell-notes-hot-cpi-means-were-not-quite-there-yet.html?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH)) * Who Pays for Tariffs ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/12/business/economy/who-pays-for-tariffs.html?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20CMS%20SL%20BH)) * Which US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives?
