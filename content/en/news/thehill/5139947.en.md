Connecticut Rep. John Larson (D) said Tuesday that he had a seizure on the House floor the previous day.

“Yesterday, at around noon, I experienced a medical incident on the House floor, when my speech momentarily paused,” a statement from Larson [posted to X reads](https://x.com/repjohnlarson/status/1889501746071839028?s=46&t=E3khqTN17-VjsQxDtM14UA). “Following the incident, I saw the House Attending Physician, Dr. Monahan, who referred me for further evaluation.”

“After a round of tests, it was determined that the cause of the brief pause in my speech was a complex partial seizure.”

In [a video captured](https://www.c-span.org/program/us-house-of-representatives/morning-hour/655546) on Tuesday available via C-SPAN, Larson can be seen speaking and then stopping, struggling to get words out after the initial stop.

“Fifteen years ago, I had a heart valve replacement due to a variation in the shape of my aortic valve that I was born with,” said Larson. “Sometimes, people with this condition can later develop symptoms such as the momentary change in speech or movement that was apparent yesterday.”

In 2023, former Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) [had two notable times where he](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4179341-mcconnell-freezes-for-second-time-during-press-conference/) halted while talking with reporters within a matter of weeks, which resulted in questions about his health.
