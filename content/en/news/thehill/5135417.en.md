The Secret Service has unveiled a Super Bowl [advertisement titled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjn69xsCdQA) “A History of Protection.”

“If you weren’t able to attend tonight’s big game, you missed a jumbotron highlight!” reads a [post on the social platform](https://x.com/SecretService/status/1888660941945868288) X on Sunday afternoon from the Secret Service.

“For 160 years, our agency has been a witness to history; and since 1901 we’ve protected the most important people and events, including #SuperBowlLIX.”

Also in the post is a video that references multiple parts of American history, including former President Lincoln, notable comments from former Presidents Kennedy and Reagan, the 9/11 attacks and the July assassination attempt against President Trump.

“America was founded on an idea of freedom. America’s always stepped forward in time of need throughout our short but powerful history,” says a voiceover in the video.

The video ends with the URL for a [webpage on careers](https://www.secretservice.gov/careers) at the Secret Service displayed on the screen.

The advertisement was [first reported](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/politics/secret-service-super-bowl-ad/index.html) by CNN and also [highlighted by Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-secret-service-drops-a-super-bowl-ad-directed-by-michael-bay-complete-with-photo-of-assassination-attempt-on-trump/). CNN also reported that sources said that director Michael Bay was enlisted by the Secret Service for work on the ad.

The Hill has reached out to the Secret Service and one of Bay’s managers.
