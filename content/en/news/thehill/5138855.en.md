President Trump [welcomed](https://thehill.com/homenews/5138703-king-of-jordan-urges-patience-as-trump-presses-gaza-takeover/) King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House Tuesday morning, as Trump [doubled down](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129814-donald-trump-gaza-strip-us-troops/) on his push for the U.S. to [take responsibility](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5136991-trumps-proposal-for-gaza-entangles-arab-allies/) for the war-torn Gaza Strip.

During the remarks, the president remained adamant that Palestinians [did not want to live in Gaza](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5126689-trump-palestinians-resettlement/) and would accept a proposal to relocate to Jordan, Egypt or elsewhere. That idea has been [met with opposition](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127510-donald-trump-gaza-takeover-allies-adversaries-react/) from the greater Arab region, as well as Turkey and other foreign allies.

Abdullah pledged Tuesday that Jordan [would be open to taking](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5138756-jordan-children-trump-aid-backpedal/) in 2,000 sick Palestinian children from Gaza amid pressure from the Trump administration.
