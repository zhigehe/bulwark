I am a life-long, center-right Republican who represented Pennsylvania in Congress for nearly 14 years. During that time, I led efforts to fight terrorism, strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness around the world and support a muscular yet humane national security strategy. I believe in a strong America that leads on the global stage. Pax Americana has benefited the U.S., our allies, friends and strategic partners since the end of World War II.

I feel compelled to speak out against efforts now underway to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development. Far from being wasteful or unnecessary, our country’s modest investment in foreign assistance is a critical tool for advancing American security, economic prosperity and geopolitical leadership. Shutting it down would not only weaken our position but also hand a major victory to China, our greatest strategic competitor.

The U.S. has a national security strategy focused on three key pillars: diplomacy, defense and development. Development is by far the least funded of the three pillars. The gutting of USAID will leave development efforts falling heavily upon the departments of State and Defense. Neither department will be as effective or capable of filling this gaping hole.

Further, it must be stated that some organizations receiving [substantial USAID funding are evangelical Christian](https://time.com/7212791/usaid-christian-foreign-aid-freeze-evangelical/) and [Catholic](https://www.christianpost.com/news/catholic-relief-services-facing-massive-cuts-amid-usaid-cuts.html). They deliver lifesaving support to the most destitute and desperate people on this planet. Churches throughout America believe it is an essential part of their faith mission to engage internationally to help those who are suffering and most in need. Sadly, people will die because of this recklessness coming out of the White House and the Department of Government Efficiency.

That said, let’s first do the math: USAID represents a tiny fraction of federal spending but delivers outsized returns. Foreign aid is often painted as a massive expense, but in reality, it [makes up less than 1 percent of the federal budget](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/02/usaid-musk-trump-faq/). Eliminating it would do nothing to address our national debt, but it would undermine U.S. interests abroad.

Money spent on USAID is an effective investment in stability, security and economic growth. Of course, like any agency or department, there are dollars not well spent. It is the role of Congress to conduct oversight and address any waste. USAID’s critics have found a [few million dollars in questionable expenditures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdw31c6HPCI) in a multi-billion dollar budget to justify shutting the agency.

The [Pentagon has an $800 billion budget](https://defensescoop.com/2025/02/07/trump-directs-elon-musk-doge-review-pentagon-dod-spending/), and I can assure there is waste there, as well as in other departments and agencies throughout the federal enterprise. Would anyone seriously suggest dismantling the entire Department of Defense in the name of rooting out wasteful or questionable spending?

Second, USAID strengthens U.S. national security by promoting stability. Weak and failing states are breeding grounds for terrorism, drug trafficking and mass migration. By addressing root causes of instability, USAID helps prevent crises before they require costly U.S. military intervention.

The Pentagon understands this well. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis [once said](https://www.c-span.org/clip/senate-committee/user-clip-mattis-ammunition/4658822), “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.” A well-funded USAID helps keep our troops out of harm’s way.

Third, USAID creates economic opportunities for American businesses. Anti-hunger campaigns include direct purchases from American farmers, and medical aid spurs more cost effectiveness from U.S. pharma. Many of our strongest trading partners today — including South Korea and Taiwan — were once recipients of U.S. foreign aid and have since become paying customers. While supporting American jobs and businesses today, USAID also helps raise up future major markets for U.S. exports. If we abandon this role, China will gladly take our place.

Fourth, USAID enhances American diplomatic influence and soft power. Military strength alone is not enough to maintain global leadership. USAID builds goodwill and strengthens alliances, making it easier for the U.S. to shape global affairs in ways that align with our interests. When America steps back, adversaries like China and Russia fill the void, expanding their influence and undermining U.S. leadership.

Fifth, USAID supports U.S. energy security and access to critical resources. The global economy depends on stable energy markets and reliable supply chains. USAID plays a role in ensuring responsible resource management and infrastructure development in key regions. Without American engagement, China gains even more leverage over industries critical to our economy and national security.

We should have no illusions — the attack on USAID is a sign of what awaits other vital U.S. investments in global engagement. USAID works hand-in-hand with the Department of Defense, the State Department and the Commerce Department. Weakening USAID would set a dangerous precedent for reducing other key international investments that keep Americans safe and prosperous.

What’s worse, this assault is an egregious usurpation of congressional authority by the executive branch. Congress authorized and funded USAID, and no president or DOGE may shut it down without a law voted on by Congress. Today, it’s USAID under the knife; tomorrow, it will be another department or agency. Congress must push back hard and fast to protect its prerogatives and its Article One power of the purse under the U.S. Constitution.

Chinese leaders must be celebrating the latest moves against at unilateral USAID disarmament by Washington, particularly in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Beijing is aggressively expanding its influence through its own Belt and Road Initiative, using predatory lending to trap countries in debt and extend its geopolitical reach. If the U.S. disengages, China will fill the gap. USAID provides a transparent, accountable alternative that promotes American values and counters China’s growing influence.

Shutting down USAID would be a strategic mistake that weakens America’s global position. At minimal cost to taxpayers, USAID delivers real benefits by stabilizing fragile regions, creating economic opportunities for American businesses and strengthening U.S. leadership. If conservatives are serious about protecting American interests and countering China, they should support and reform USAID, not dismantle it.
