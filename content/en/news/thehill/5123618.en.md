(NEXSTAR) — Jersey numbers can help you identify your favorite NFL player on the field, distinguishing them from their teammates. Those same numbers are also helpful when referees are reporting who caused a flag to be thrown.

But what about the numbers NFL referees wear? It’s not like you need to figure out which Kansas City Chiefs tight end just caught that pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes. (Have you ever noticed how similar Travis Kelce and Noah Gray can look on television?)

Never noticed the numbers on a referee’s jersey?

They appear both on the referee’s back and left sleeve. You can see that on two referees in the photo below — No. 47, Tom Podraza, and No. 31, Mearl Robinson.

While game officials refer to player numbers when calling fouls, that presumably wouldn’t be necessary for their fellow referee. They also don’t serve to identify a referee’s role in the game — that is denoted by the letter on their jersey. (In the case above, Podraza is a line judge and Robinson a field judge.)

The numbers do, however, serve a purpose.


[Why can’t NFL players show their legs during games?](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4461590-why-cant-nfl-players-show-their-legs-during-games/?ipid=promo-link-block1) 

According to [Referee](https://www.referee.com/take-a-number/), a sports officiating magazine, NFL officials have been wearing numbers since 1942. Some numbers have been assigned, while others were allowed to pick their number from a list of those not yet taken. Some change numbers during their career, often because the official wearing the number they want has retired.

Dean Blandino, who served as the NFL’s vice president of officiating from 2013 through 2017, explained to Referee that, during his tenure, some numbers would be shelved after an official’s retirement. Nos. 1 and 13 were off-limits for years but were later assigned to Scott Novak and Patrick Turner (pictured below), respectively.

The NFL provides a [roster](https://operations.nfl.com/officiating/the-officials/2024-roster-of-nfl-officials/) of its officials, sorted by their field position.

There are [seven officials](https://operations.nfl.com/officiating/the-officials/officials-responsibilities-positions/) in every NFL game, and they are denoted based on where they stand during play and the letters on their jerseys.

In the photo above, for example, No. 85, Daniel Gallagher, has LJ on the back of his jersey, marking him as the line judge. Podraza, pictured further up, has the same LJ on his back, while Robinson sports an FJ, for field judge.

The other officiating positions are demarcated in similar manners: umpire is U; down judge is DJ, side judge is SJ, and back judge is BJ. The referee — specifically the one that announces calls on the field — stands out with an R on the jersey and a white hat, while the rest of the crew wears black caps.

If the assignment details and an official’s name aren’t immediately available, and the letters were overlooked, a referee’s number can also help identify them, Blandino explained.

In case you’re curious, there are [121 numbers](https://operations.nfl.com/officiating/the-officials/2024-roster-of-nfl-officials/) currently being worn by officials ranging from Novak’s No. 1 to Robin DeLorenzo at No. 134. Unassigned numbers include 48, 61, 64, 65, 69, 70 (more on this in a moment), 71, 94, 108, 116, 123, 128, and 129.

Curious who you’re seeing during Super Bowl LIX? The [NFL announced](https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lix-officiating-crew-led-by-referee-ron-torbert-announced) the officiating crew will be led by referee Ron Torbert, No. 62. He’ll be joined by side judge Boris Cheek (No. 41), umpire Mike Morton (No. 89), down judge Max Causey (No. 21), line judge Mark Stewart (No. 75), field judge Robinson (No. 31), back judge Jonah Monroe (No. 120), and replay official Kevin Brown (replay officials don’t get jersey numbers, unfortunately).

Like an NFL player, an NFL official’s number can become part of their identity. Jerry Markbreit previously told [Football Zebras](https://www.footballzebras.com/2019/06/nfl100-in-1979-the-nfl-renumbered-its-officials-after-3-years-they-scrapped-the-failed-plan/) that even in his retirement, he was still referred to as “Nine,” the number he wore while officiating for the league from 1976 to 1998.

Morton, a member of the St. Louis Rams team that won Super Bowl XXXIV, had multiple numerical identities during his seven seasons playing in the NFL. During his time, he wore four different jersey numbers — No. 50, with the then-Oakland Raiders; No. 58, with the Rams; No. 53, with the Green Bay Packers; and No. 51 with the Indianapolis Colts — but not his current referee number, 89.

Unfortunately for him, all four numbers are currently in use by other officials: Aaron Santi, Don Willard, Sarah Thomas, and Carl Cheffers, respectively.

There is one number that no current or future NFL official will be able to wear: No. 70. The NFL retired the number after its previous owner, Jerry Seeman, died in 2013. He spent 15 years as an official before being named the NFL’s director of officiating, a role he held for a decade. To honor his legacy, his number was [retired](https://operations.nfl.com/officiating/spotlights/jerry-seeman/) and, for part of that season, all NFL officials wore a patch bearing his initials on their hats.
