[President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/) said he will announce [25 percent tariffs](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5135288-trump-says-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-coming-monday/) on steel and aluminum on Monday, adding that he would also kick off reciprocal tariffs in the days after.

Trump said that the [steel and aluminum tariffs](https://thehill.com/homenews/5134752-live-updates-elon-musk-donald-trump-budget-dodge-treasury/) would impact “everybody” when asked what countries would be effected.

The Senate returns late this afternoon, when Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for director of national intelligence comes up for a procedural vote. One of Trump’s most controversial nominees, she managed last week to [advance out of committee](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5126051-tulsi-gabbard-dni-nomination-advances/) on a party-line vote.

Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) continues to negotiate with House and Senate Republicans to try to reach a deal to fund the government past the March 14 deadline and enact Trump’s priorities. The Senate is also working through Trump’s cabinet nominations.

And don’t miss The Hill’s three-part “Future of Energy” series, kicking off [with reporting by Rachel Frazin](https://thehill.com/?p=5131169/) about how falling costs drive the United States toward green energy — even as political tides shift.
