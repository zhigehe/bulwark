Senators will take to the floor Thursday morning to vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s [nomination to lead](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5139220-kennedy-nomination-advances/) the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Kennedy’s confirmation would put the longtime anti-vaccine activist in charge of the sprawling bureaucracy that oversees the nation’s health agencies. HHS oversees 13 separate agencies, and its $1.7 trillion budget accounted for more than 20 percent of the nation’s spending.

The environmental lawyer, who [was tapped](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4991324-trump-nominates-kennedy-health-department/) by President Trump to lead the agency last month, has faced an uphill battle over his vaccine and abortion views. His nomination [was advanced](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5123633-kennedy-nomination-advances/) by the Senate Finance Committee last week, [after facing](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5117209-robert-kennedy-senate-hearing/) two fiery [confirmation hearings](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5114603-robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/).

The vote is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. EST.
