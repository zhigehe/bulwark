Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah) slammed Beyoncé as a “DEI” winner after winning Best Country Album at the the Grammys.

Owens was [asked on Friday](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/house-republican-rips-beyonce-as-dei-winner-after-she-nabs-best-country-album-grammy-nobody-respects-that/) about what he thought about her win, which makes her the first Black woman to earn the award.

“I think that’s the closest thing to DEI we’re gonna see right now,” he said.

After taking office, Trump [signed an executive order](https://thehill.com/business/5103287-trump-dei-corporations-diversity-inclusion/) that removed diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at the federal level.

Owens noted he isn’t a country music fan himself, but understands that listeners may be frustrated by Beyoncé’s win.

“You put all that hard work, develop your fan base, you go out there, you work to develop a reputation, and all of a sudden, somebody comes out of the blue because she’s popular … and she gets the best,” Owens said. “Nobody respects that.”

The Utah representative doubled down on his criticisms and said he believes earning the title “diminishes” Beyoncé’s reputation and it diminishes the significance of the award. Fairness is what the United States is all about, he argued.

“That’s why we’re so excited about what President Trump did with protecting women from men. We do not like unfairness,” he continued pointing to President Trump’s [recent transgender-related executive order.](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5126182-donald-trump-executive-order-transgender-sports-ban/)

“I think Beyoncé and the Grammys … they’re gonna suffer long term because of it,” he concluded.
