(NEXSTAR) – Kendrick Lamar sported a letterman-style jacket during his Super Bowl halftime performance Sunday, but it wasn’t repping either team on the field.

In big letters across the front, the jacket read “GLORIA,” an apparent reference to his song with SZA by the same name. SZA performed alongside Lamar during the Super Bowl LIX show.

Eagle-eyed viewers spotted more patches and designs on the jacket with special significance. The back was emblazoned with “PGLang,” the name of the entertainment firm co-founded by Lamar and Dave Free. In smaller text above the PGLang logo, the jacket said “Compton,” Lamar’s hometown Los Angeles neighborhood.

Patches on his left arm referenced the upcoming Grand National tour, which Lamar and SZA will be headlining, and his album titled GNX.

His right arm referenced lyrics of his hit diss track “Not Like U” and his song “Peekaboo.”

The halftime performance was a medley of Lamar’s biggest hits, with help from SZA and Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam.

The Philadelphia Eagles led the Kansas City Chiefs 24-0 at the half.
