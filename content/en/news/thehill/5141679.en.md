Sgamma, who would lead the **Bureau of Land Management**, has frequently spoken with journalists and appeared before Congress to promote the industry.    Sgamma co-wrote the chapter of **Project 2025**, the sprawling blueprint for governance under the next Republican president, concerning the Interior Department.
