The Trump administration has moved quickly to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has signaled plans to target funding at the departments of Education and Defense, to name a few.    **The latest target**: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).    **What we know:** The administration and DOGE [descended on the agency](https://thehill.com/business/5136827-trump-administration-targets-cfpb/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS) over the weekend. Newly confirmed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director **Russell** **Vought** was appointed acting CFPB director Friday, and since then:   * Vought ordered the agency to “cease all supervision and examination activity” and “stakeholder engagement,” as well as telling employees to “stand down from performing any work task.” * He also said the agency would not take its next drawdown of funding from the Federal Reserve. * The CFPB’s X account has been deleted, and its [homepage](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS) shows a “404: Page not found” error, but the overall site remains functional. * Employees affiliated with DOGE have gained access to CFPB’s data systems, according to Bloomberg News, giving them full access to the information stored at the agency, such as sensitive bank examination and enforcement records.   **From one CFPB employee**: “I think everyone assumes this is the USAID playbook, and I think everyone’s operating off of the assumption that we’re about to get annihilated, the way that they were annihilated,” the employee [told The Hill’s Julia Shapero](https://thehill.com/business/5136827-trump-administration-targets-cfpb/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS).    **Just in:** Two career officials at the CFPB resigned Tuesday following the order to stand down from all work, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-king-abdullah-meeting-tulsi-gabbard-confirmation-02-11-25?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS#cm70mizdu000l3b6m91278bwn).    **What’s the GOP’s beef with the CFPB?**: Republicans have opposed the CFPB since its inception, arguing the agency oversteps its regulatory authority, as well as the bounds of the Constitution. They’ve tried to fight the agency multiple times in court to little avail.    The CFPB was the brainchild of Sen. **Elizabeth** **Warren** (D-Mass.) before she joined Congress and was established to protect consumers in the financial sector (i.e., credit cards, student loans, etc.).    **FWIW:** The CFPB can’t be eliminated without an act of Congress. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **➤  LAWMAKER REACTIONS:** | | --- |  | **Warren:** “So why are these two guys trying to gut the CFPB? … It’s not rocket science: Trump campaigned on helping working people, but now that he’s in charge, this is the payoff to the rich guys who invested in his campaign and who want to cheat families — and not have anybody around to stop them.”    Rep. **Maxine** **Waters** (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee: “Why the richest man in the world is working to gut the agency that has returned $21 billion to harmed American consumers is simple … Such a platform would be regulated by — you guessed it — the CFPB.” | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **➤  RELATED READS:** | | --- |  | * Shutting down CFPB ‘begging for another financial crisis’: Former director ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5138043-trump-cfpb-shut-down/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS)) * Trump is slashing agencies long hated by the GOP.

The mayor has been scheduled to go on trial on federal corruption charges starting in April.    “In a short memo, acting Deputy Attorney General **Emil Bove** said the DOJ reached the decision to dismiss the counts without assessing the strength of the case and indicated that the attorneys who filed the charges did nothing wrong,” The Hill’s **Ella Lee**[reports](https://thehill.com/homenews/5137361-doj-charges-nyc-mayor-eric-adams/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%2012:30%20Report%20JB%20CMS).    **Why did they dismiss the charges?:**Bove claimed the case “improperly interfered” with Adams’s 2025 mayoral campaign and also pointed to the Trump administration’s efforts to end “weaponization” in the federal government.    **But that’s not all:**He also said the pending prosecution “unduly restricted” the mayor’s ability to help the feds enforce the Trump administration’s illegal immigration crackdown.    **Adams’s response this hour**: “I thank the Justice Department for its honesty. Now we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city.
