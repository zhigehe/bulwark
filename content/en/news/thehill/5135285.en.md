President Trump announced that Sunday was the first ever Gulf of America Day, following an executive order that set in motion the process of changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico.

The president signed a proclamation on Sunday and had the flight crew announce that Air Force One was passing over the newly renamed gulf when it flew from Palm Beach, Fla., to New Orleans. Trump made the trip on Sunday to attend the Super Bowl.

The proclamation states “February 9, 2025, as Gulf of America Day, adding, “I call upon public officials and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.”

Trump signed an [executive order on](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5096682-desantis-trump-gulf-of-america-executive-order/) Inauguration Day, giving the Department of the Interior 30 days to take “all appropriate action” needed to facilitate the name change. He pledged to [rename the Gulf of Mexico](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5095345-trump-plans-rename-gulf-america/) during his inaugural address, resurfacing a proposal he [floated during a](https://thehill.com/newsletters/1230-report/5071690-facebook-instagram-fact-check-dc-pandas-snow-chick-fila-a-fries-change/) wide-ranging press conference during the transition.

Just after Trump signed the executive order, the U.S. Coast Guard [started using the term](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5103934-us-coast-guard-starts-using-gulf-of-america/) Gulf of America, marking the U.S. government’s first official use of the term.
