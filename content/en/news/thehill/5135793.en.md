A performer in Kendrick Lamar’s [Super Bowl](https://thehill.com/homenews/5134752-live-updates-elon-musk-donald-trump-budget-dodge-treasury/) halftime [show](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5135481-the-meaning-behind-kendrick-lamars-jacket-during-the-super-bowl-halftime-show/) was detained late Sunday after showing a Sudanese-Palestinian flag on the field.

The NFL confirmed to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/super-bowl-halftime-protest-palestine-0d670147fe14286bfb665f739772f0a7) that the individual will be “banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events.”

The New Orleans Police Department also said law enforcement was “working to determine applicable charges in this incident.”

The individual stood on a prop car used in the performance and unfurled a combination flag with the words “Sudan” and “Gaza” written on it.

The NFL told the AP that the performer hid the flag during the beginning of the show and revealed it late in the performance. No one involved in production reportedly knew that he would be doing that.

The performance continued without major disruption and the flag didn’t appear to be shown in the live broadcast of Lamar’s halftime show, the news service noted.

The Hill has also reached out to the NFL and New Orleans Police Department for comment.

Lamar’s performance highlighted some of his biggest hits, and featured SZA and Samuel L. Jackson, with the actor dressed as Uncle Sam.

The Philadelphia Eagles ultimately beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-22.
