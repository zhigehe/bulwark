Fans of former President Obama will have a chance to step into his shoes — for the right price.

A pair of [golf shoes](https://bid.juliensauctions.com/lot-details/index/catalog/564/lot/243063/barack-obama-game-worn-golf-shoes-and-signed-phoenician-resort-register) sported by the ex-commander in chief is one of several pieces of presidential memorabilia up for grabs as part of a new auction being offered by Julien’s Auctions.

Obama wore the size 12 Foot-Joy Superlites for a 16-hole golf game at The Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., back in 2009, according to the auction house.

The footwear and a course registration sheet signed by Obama are expected to fetch at least $2,000.

Other items in the “Spotlight: History & Technology” collection, which ends on Feb. 27, include a pair of “Blues Brothers”-inspired shades signed by former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, and actors Dan Akroyd and Jim Belushi.

[The sunglasses](https://bid.juliensauctions.com/lot-details/index/catalog/564/lot/248674/bill-clinton-al-gore-dan-akroyd-and-jim-belushi-signed-house-of-blues-1996-campaign-event-sunglasses), estimated to sell for $500 to $700, were signed at a 1995 fundraiser at the House of Blues in Las Vegas.

At the event, Clinton and Gore sang along as Belushi performed “Viva Las Vegas.”

“Clinton tapped the rhythm with his hand as he sang along, though he missed some lyrics,” the Associated Press [reported at](https://www.deseret.com/1995/9/22/19194372/clinton-s-blues-clog-sunset-strip/) the time.

Other highlights of the auction — billed as an “event offering rare and fascinating artifacts documenting monumental moments in world history, as well as archival material and personal objects from the disruptors and leaders who played key roles in revolutionizing politics, science, and industry in the 20th and 21st centuries” — include the late President John F. Kennedy’s [boxer shorts](https://bid.juliensauctions.com/lot-details/index/catalog/564/lot/248668/john-f-kennedy-owned-wwii-navy-issued-boxer-shorts-with-letter-from-jfk-s-secretary) from his time serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, [a bow tie](https://bid.juliensauctions.com/lot-details/index/catalog/564/lot/248676/steve-jobs-photo-shoot-worn-and-stage-worn-1984-macintosh-computer-release-bow-tie-with-book) that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs dressed in to promote the release of the Macintosh computer in 1984 and a 2010 [black hoodie](https://bid.juliensauctions.com/lot-details/index/catalog/564/lot/250231/mark-zuckerberg-worn-2010-facebook-hoodie-with-zuckerberg-signed-letter) worn by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
