Cardi B is slamming President Trump for damaging her designer shoes while attending the Super Bowl, saying her uncle who was deported should “come back” in exchange for the footwear snafu.

“I’m f—ing mad today,” the New York-born performer said in a video this week [posted on](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib) Instagram Live. The “Up” rapper recounted her experience at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans on Sunday. Trump was the first sitting president [to attend](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5125557-donald-trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-2025/) the high-profile football game.

But Cardi B, who was born Belcalis Almánzar, said since Trump was in attendance, Secret Service was “giving us a hard time.”

“The Secret Service was not playing in that motherf—ing stadium,” she told her 164 million followers, suggesting that she had to walk rather than be driven around the venue because the security detail “stopped all the little carts and shit because Trump was there.”

“F—ed up my shoe,” the 32-year-old entertainer said, before displaying in front of the camera a spiked stiletto with a damaged red sole.

“Shoe cost me three bands. All [because] of Trump,” she said.

“Now I like him lesser,” Cardi B said of the commander in chief. “You ain’t had to go to no damn Super Bowl.”

“Now he going to have to… bring my uncle to come back because my uncle got deported,” she said. The music star offered no additional details about her family member.

The Trump administration has [prioritized mass deportations](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5105543-trumps-immigration-crackdown-southern-border-birthright-citizenship-aslyum-refugee-programs-biden/), a vow the president consistently made on the campaign trail.

Cardi B has frequently weighed in on political and hot-button issues over the years. She [was critical](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4667977-cardi-b-biden-trump-rolling-stone/) of former President Biden, but [appeared at](https://thehill.com/video-clips/4966322-watch-live-kamala-harris-cardi-b-milwaukee-campaign/) a campaign rally last year for Vice President Harris’s White House bid.
