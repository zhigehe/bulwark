Former White House aide Sean Spicer said President Trump has acknowledged that “it may take a little while” for to [prices to come down](https://thehill.com/business/economy/5107379-vance-says-gas-grocery-prices-are-going-to-come-down-but-will-take-a-little-bit-of-time/) — referring to a promise Trump made on the campaign trail.

“He’s been very clear, it may take a little while, it may be, you know, there might be a little bit of pain involved because of the tariffs, but his eye is focused on this,” Spicer [said Monday evening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s2H0pb-tPI) on NewsNation’s “The Hill.”

“There’s nobody better that has a feel for the American people than Donald Trump,” he told host Blake Burman.

Trump doubled down on his pledge to [lower food prices](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5038002-trump-food-prices-lowered/) and combat inflation through legislative policies following his [November election victory](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4969061-trump-wins-presidential-election/). However, some have criticized the president for [not seeing an immediate impact](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5108645-democrats-criticize-trump-over-high-grocery-prices/) after he returned to the Oval Office.

Spicer urged consumers to understand that change won’t happen overnight.

“He [Trump] understands that people are paying more for this stuff, but there’s no magic wand that you can wave in two seconds and make it go away, right,” he said.

“He’s trying to bring back manufacturing, the [Department of Government Efficiency] stuff. The bottom line is spending, government spending in particular, has a direct correlation to inflation. He’s trying to cut out the waste there,” Spicer continued. “I mean, this is an all-out assault.”

In recent days, the administration granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — [run by](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133585-elon-musk-doge-reforms/) tech billionaire Elon Musk — access to federal agency’s [spending records](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) in hopes of identifying unnecessary expenditures, much to the dismay of Democrats.

Party leaders have rallied to hold [protests](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5131567-democrats-target-musk/) outside of the Treasury Department and Department of Labor raising concerns with Musk’s probe. They have also pushed back on his moves to dismantle the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://thehill.com/business/5136827-trump-administration-targets-cfpb/) (CFPB), [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/) (USAID) and [Education Department](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/).

A federal judge sided with Democrats late last week to [block](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5134238-judge-blocks-doge-musk-treasury/) DOGE employees from accessing the Treasury Department’s payment systems, temporarily preventing any massive changes from occurring for the time being.

Still, Trump has [placed his confidence](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133093-trump-musk-doge-usaid-ishiba/) in Musk, saying last week that he is “doing a great job.”

“He’s finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste. You see it with the USAID, but you’re going to see it even more so with other agencies and other parts of government,” he told reporters on Friday from the White House.
