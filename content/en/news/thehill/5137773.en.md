House Republican leaders will deliver remarks Tuesday morning as lawmakers [appear divided](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5136844-house-republicans-trump-agenda/) on some of President Trump’s legislative agenda — an issue that threatens to derail their timeline as the Senate prepares to [push a competing budget plan](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5129195-senate-gop-house-republicans-trump-agenda-bill/).

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) suggested Monday that the lower chamber could advance a budget resolution by the end of the week — a diversion from his hope that a blueprint would move through committee on Tuesday. Some of the issues [bringing the most trouble](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5128657-tensions-house-gop-trump-agenda/) include proposals to raise the debt limit, reducing state and local tax (SALT) caps and how the government would pay for tax cut extensions.

Their remarks come as the deadline to [avert a government shutdown](https://thehill.com/business/budget/5126799-shutdown-fears-trump-moves-democrats/), March 14, inches closer.

The press conference is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST.
