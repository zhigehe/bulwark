House Republicans on Wednesday released their budget resolution in an effort to [advance](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5136844-house-republicans-trump-agenda/) President Trump’s ambitious legislative agenda.

Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), the chair of the House Budget Committee, [told House Republicans on Tuesday](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5139601-house-republicans-doubt-budget-resolution/) that his committee would take action on the legislation on Thursday.

The resolution unlocks the process Republicans hope to use to pass Trump’s agenda with only Republican votes and provides a blueprint for the final measure.

Near unanimity will be required for Republicans to send the final bill to Trump’s desk since the slim majorities are attempting to do it through a special reconciliation process that bypasses the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

Read the resolution below:
