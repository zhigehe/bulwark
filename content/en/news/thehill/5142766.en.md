Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is holding a news conference Thursday morning from Brussels focusing on the [Russia-Ukraine war](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5141716-trump-ukraine-war-negotiations/), which is just over a week from entering its third year.

Hegseth’s remarks come a day after he [seemingly shut the door](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5140389-hegseth-nato-membership-ukraine-russia/) on the U.S. supporting Ukraine joining NATO. In remarks from the alliance headquarters, the [newly minted](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5106171-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-confirmed/) Pentagon chief also called it “unrealistic” for Ukraine to expect to return to pre-2014 borders.

President Trump, who [spoke with](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5140775-trump-putin-talk-ukraine/) both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, said [negotiations to end the war](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5134714-trump-urkraine-war-talks/) were underway. He expects to meet in person with Putin in Saudi Arabia in the future, though a timeline was not offered.

Hegseth’s conference is scheduled to begin at 10:45 a.m. EST.
