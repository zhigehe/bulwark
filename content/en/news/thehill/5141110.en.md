Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to hold a press conference Wednesday afternoon, just a week after she was [sworn-in](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5128146-pam-bondi-justice-department-attorney-general-sworn-in/) to lead the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Her remarks come as President Trump has faced criticism over the [decision to fire](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124328-trump-administration-purge-fbi/) several DOJ prosecutors and FBI agents who [worked on his legal cases](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5109360-doj-fires-prosecutors-who-worked-on-trump-criminal-cases/), citing an inability to “trust” them.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s [Department of Government Efficiency](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133585-elon-musk-doge-reforms/) (DOGE) has also been under the microscope for the advisory group’s [access](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) to the Treasury Department’s payment systems and other agencies’ information. DOJ earlier this month [issued a ruling](https://thehill.com/business/5130107-treasury-department-limits-doge-access/) to limit that access and a federal judge [later blocked](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5134238-judge-blocks-doge-musk-treasury/) DOGE from the payment systems. The Justice Department [rebuked](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5135798-trump-doj-musk-treasury-payment-systems-ruling/) the order.

House Democrats have also [called for an investigation](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5140900-democrats-justice-department-violations/) into top officials at DOJ, alleging they violated the department’s code of conduct.

Bondi is set to speak at 4:30 p.m. EST.
