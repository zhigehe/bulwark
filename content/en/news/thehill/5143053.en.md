Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith (D) will not run for reelection in 2026, opening up a seat in the solidly Democratic state, she announced Thursday.

Smith said in a [video posted to](https://x.com/SenTinaSmith/status/1890068717486452772) the social platform X that she has “loved” her job as a U.S. senator but wants to spend more time with her family, as she has four grandchildren.

“This job has been the honor of a lifetime. For the rest of my term, I’ll work as hard as I can for Minnesotans and our country,” she said in the post. “Thank you so much, Minnesota.”
