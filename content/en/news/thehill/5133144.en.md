PORTLAND, Ore. ([KOIN](http://koin.com)) – Trader Joe’s patrons nationwide have taken to social media to comment on a new policy that limits the amount of eggs shoppers can buy.

The company told Nexstar’s KOIN that limits are currently in place at all of its U.S. locations.

“Due to ongoing issues with the supply of eggs, we are currently limiting egg purchases to one dozen per customer, per day, in all Trader Joe’s stores across the country,” Trader Joe’s spokesperson Nakia Rohde said in an email. “We hope these limits will help to ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe’s.”

The grocer’s website shows that one dozen pasture-raised, large brown eggs costs around $5.

Other companies are taking different measures to address the ongoing issues.

On Tuesday, the [Associated Press reported](https://www.koin.com/news/business/ap-business/ap-waffle-house-adds-surcharge-to-eggs-as-massive-bird-flu-outbreak-leads-to-soaring-prices/) that restaurant chain Waffle House added a $0.50 surcharge per egg, attributing the decision to avian influenza.

An outbreak of the bird flu that began in 2022 is largely to blame for the skyrocketing prices. Anytime the virus is found on a poultry farm, the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the virus’ spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can cause a supply crunch.

Egg prices in the United States, meanwhile, have significantly increased in price in the last year. Recent data from the Labor Department shows [a nearly 40% increase](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5092350-eggs-are-about-to-get-even-more-expensive-expert-says-heres-how-much) since January 2024, and the Agriculture Department predicts prices are going to soar another 20% this year.
