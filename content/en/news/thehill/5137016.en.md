Some forest management projects that aim to mitigate wildfie risk are among the projects that have been halted under President Trump’s executive order to freeze spending.

In a letter to the Trump administration [on Monday](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/25.02.10-Hazardous-Fuels-Letter-FINAL.pdf), 14 Democrats wrote that they were hearing from constituents that “the Bureau of Land Management has issued stop work orders” for projects that aim to reduce wildfire risk.

A statement from the land management bureau confirmed that some projects — those that were funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — are “undergoing review to ensure consistency with the Executive Order.” The Bureau of Land Management noted, however, that projects funded by the regular congressional appropriations process “are continuing forward across the West.”

The Democrats’ letter was was led by Sens. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).

In it, they and 10 colleagues raise concerns that halting the programs could raise wildfire risk — and argue that the order is unconstitutional.

“We are imploring you to rescind the order to stop work on these hazardous fuels reduction efforts, as well as any other wildland fire management programs that are working to reduce risk and safeguard communities from catastrophic wildfire,” they wrote in their letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting Agriculture Secretary Gary Washington.

The Impoundment Control Act “prohibits any action or inaction that precludes Federal funds from being obligated or spent, either temporarily or permanently, without following the strictly circumscribed requirements of that law, which have not been honored in this instance,” they wrote.

The letter comes after devastating wildfires recently hit California, [killing at least 29](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-wildfires-what-we-know-victims-killed-rcna188240). It also comes as a federal judge in Rhode Island [is ordering](http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5136255-trump-federal-funding-freeze-comply/) the Trump administration to unfreeze federal grants.
