President Trump has started his second term with a positive approval [rating in a new](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-approval-opinion-poll-2025-2-9/) CBS/YouGov poll.

In the CBS/YouGov poll, 53 percent said that when it comes to “the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president,” they support it. Forty-seven percent said when it comes to the way the president is handling his job, they do not support it.

“New polling from CBS News shows Americans are overwhelmingly positive about President Donald J. Trump’s return to office and his commitment to making good on his promises,” the White House said in a release emailed Sunday.

Trump’s return to the Oval Office has rattled Washington, with the first few weeks featuring the president signing a blitz [of executive orders](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5098445-trump-executive-orders-first-day/), tech billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s [actions on the](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129237-kinzinger-democrats-elon-musk-doge/) federal government and [comments from](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129312-trump-gaza-strip-proposal-takeaways/) Trump about the U.S. taking “long-term ownership” of the Gaza Strip.

Other findings in the CBS/YouGov poll included Trump being referred to as “effective” by 58 percent, while 24 percent said the opposite. The president was also referred to as “competent” by 55 percent, while 45 said the opposite.

The CBS/YouGov poll took place Feb. 5 to 7, featuring 2,175 people and about plus or minus 2.5 percentage points as its margin of error.
