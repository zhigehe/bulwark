Elon Musk has become one of President Trump’s [most influential allies](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5126651-elton-musk-trump-white-house/) and has taken a [prominent role](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133335-elon-musk-government-power-grab/) in Washington as the head of the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133093-trump-musk-doge-usaid-ishiba/).

The tech tycoon and richest man in the world has an estimated [net worth](https://thehill.com/business/5130784-elon-musk-donald-trump-tariffs-doge-net-worth/) of [more than $300 billion](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/what-is-elon-musks-net-worth/), according to Forbes. Musk is best known for his roles with Tesla and Space X but recently listed his current job as “White House tech support,” according [to his social platform X account](https://x.com/elonmusk?lang=en).

Musk, who has been [designated as a “special government employee,”](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-musk-is-a-special-government-employee-the-white-house-confirms/) has been criticized, along with DOGE, for his [efforts to shrink](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) government spending. The newly formed agency faces [several lawsuits](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5133955-democratic-ags-sue-over-doge-access-to-treasury-payment-systems/) and challenges as critics allege the billionaire has overstepped his bounds.

Here’s a breakdown of Musk’s immediate family and those closely associated with him.

Errol and Maye Musk
-------------------

Musk is the son of Errol Musk, a South African engineer, politician and businessman, and Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a professional model.

According to reports, Musk and his father have [been estranged at times](https://people.com/human-interest/who-is-errol-musk-elon-musk-father/), but Errol Musk said during an [exclusive interview with NewsNation’s “Cuomo”](https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/elon-musk-father-errol-nazi-salute-rubbish/) that he is happy with his son’s connection to Trump. Errol said that Elon has “broken the mold” to some extent, but the family would “like to see more” from him.

Errol Musk also defended his son for what some perceived as a [Nazi salute-like gesture](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5097672-elon-musk-responds-salute-criticism/) made at a Trump rally and dismissed the comparison as “absolute nonsense” and “rubbish.”

**Justine (Wilson) Musk**
-------------------------

Justine Wilson Musk, a Canadian author, was Elon Musk’s first wife, with whom he shares five children. [Marie Claire reported](https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/) that the two met while students at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, where Elon was a year older than Justine. Justine Musk described Elon, who filed for divorce from her in 2008, as a “clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent.”

The couple married in 2000 and according to the Marie Claire story, Elon told his wife when they were dancing at their wedding, “I am the alpha in this relationship.”

Throughout the relationship, Justine Musk constantly reminded her husband that she was his wife, “not his employee.”

“If you were my employee,” Elon Musk reportedly said repeatedly, “I would fire you.”

**Grimes (Clare Boucher)**
--------------------------

[Grimes](https://www.instagram.com/grimes/?hl=en), whose real name is Clare Elise Boucher, was first romantically linked with Musk in 2018, [according to People](https://people.com/music/elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship-timeline/). Grimes, a Canadian musician, made her first public appearance with Musk at the Met Gala and once described the couple’s relationship as “very fluid,” according to a [Vanity Fair report](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars).

The couple, who met after Musk was married twice to [actress Talulah Riley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1506908/) with whom Musk has no children, have three children together despite never marrying.

The third of the couple’s children came after they reconciled after previously splitting in 2021, [People reported](https://people.com/parents/everything-to-know-about-elon-musks-family-kids/).

**Shivon Zilis**
----------------

Zilis is the director of operations and special projects at [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/), which is owned by Musk.  The startup company makes computer links that are designed to be implanted in the human brain, [Business Insider reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/shivon-zilis-reported-mother-elon-musk-twins-2022-7).

Zilis gave birth to twins who were fathered by Musk in 2021 before reports emerged that Zilis and Musk were bringing another child, Musk’s 12th, into the world in 2024.

Zilis, and and Justine Musk, have homes that are part of a compound in Austin, Texas, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/business/elon-musk-children-compound.html). The report indicated that Grimes has steered clear of the compound due to an ongoing legal battle with Musk.

**Elon Musk’s Children**
------------------------

**Nevada Alexander**

Musk’s first son was born in 2002, the first of five children shared by Musk and Wilson. However, the infant died 10 weeks after he was born from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the “People” report indicated.

Wilson wrote in her Marie Claire essay that Nevada stopped breathing while down for a nap and by the time paramedics resuscitated him, he had been deprived of oxygen, and he was brain dead.

**Vivian Jenna Wilson and Griffin**

The twins were born and were conceived via in vitro fertilization in 2004, the [website for NBC’s “Today” show reported](https://www.today.com/parents/parents/elon-musk-kids-rcna19692). The twins were the first of two multiple children that Musk and Wilson had together.

In 2022, Vivian petitioned a court to have her name legally changed to Vivian Jenna Wilson to allow her to share the same last name as her mother’s maiden name, People reported. The petition also included a request to recognize her gender as female.

**Kai, Saxon and Damian**

Justine Wilson Musk gave birth to the triplets in 2006, two years after the twins were born. “People” magazine reported that all five children were conceived using IVF.

**X Æ A-12**

Musk and Grimes welcomed their first child to the world in 2020 with a son, whose name was later changed to X Æ A-Xii — an homage to an A-12 reconnaissance plane, People reported.

The couple differs on how their son’s name is pronounced with Musk taking credit for the A-12 portion of the name while saying that his Grimes was responsible for most of the same.

The young boy, who goes by “X,” appeared at a Trump victory rally the night before the 2025 inauguration.

**Arider and Azure**

The twins, Strider (a boy) – and Azure (a girl), were born secretly in 2021 and were the first of three children born to Musk and Zilis. Both of the children were born in Austin, Texas.

The couple petitioned a court to have the twins’ last name match that of their father while their mother’s last name was used as part of their middle name.

**Exa Dark Sideræl**

The girl was born in 2021 and was born via a surrogate three months after Musk and Grimes split. According to Grimes, Exa refers to a supercomputing term while Dark represents the unknown, “People” reported. Sideræl is defined as “the true time of the universe, including star time, deep space time and not relative earth time.

**Techno Mechanicus**

The boy, who is the third child conceived by Musk and Grimes, was born in 2023, but details have not been shared where or exactly when the child was born.

**Elon Musk’s 12th child**

Musk announced in 2024 that he had given birth to another child with Zilis. No specifics, including the birth date and name of the child, have been released, “People” reported.
