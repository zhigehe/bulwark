Tech billionaire Elon Musk [called for the annual](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5134725-elon-musk-impeachment-demand/) firing of judges following an early Saturday [decision from](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5134238-judge-blocks-doge-musk-treasury/) a judge stating that the Treasury Department should bar access to anyone besides “civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties” from its payment systems.

“I’d like to propose that the worst 1% of appointed judges, as determined by elected bodies, be fired every year. This will weed out the most corrupt and least competent,” the tech mogul [said in a post](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888589047129329675?s=46&t=yvJsmV0mu2913uNCsjBAcQ) on his social platform X.

The order halts special government employees and those detailed from outside the department from getting into the systems, which includes Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Musk was seemingly infuriated by the order and took to X on Saturday [to make a few posts](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5134725-elon-musk-impeachment-demand/).

“A corrupt judge protecting corruption,” Musk said in an early Saturday X post. “He needs to be impeached NOW.”

In [recent weeks](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129237-kinzinger-democrats-elon-musk-doge/), Musk, DOGE’s leader, [has dispatched staff](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5127932-gop-oversight-democrats-subpoena-elon-musk/) to multiple agencies and has been able to access databases at the Office of Personnel Management and the Treasury Department.

David Lebryk, a top Treasury Department nonpolitical career official, retired recently in the wake of him butting heads with Musk allies on government [payment systems](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119996-david-lebryk-retirement-treasury-doge-musk/), a source previously told The Hill.

Lebryk’s retirement followed a clash over a request from DOGE for access to a payment system used by Treasury officials to disburse funds.

Earlier [this week,](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5130206-elon-musk-doge-democrats-national-security/) Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee advised White House chief of staff Susie Wiles that Musk’s access to government databases, as well as the sensitive federal payments system, “jeopardizes national security.”

“No information has been provided to Congress or the public as to who has been formally hired under DOGE, under what authority or regulations DOGE is operating, or how DOGE is vetting and monitoring its staff and representatives before providing them seemingly unfettered access to classified materials and Americans’ personal information,” the Democrats said in a letter.
