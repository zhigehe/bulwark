NEW ORLEANS (NEXSTAR) – The players on the field Sunday at Super Bowl LIX are celebrities in their own right, but they’re far from the only big names gathered in New Orleans for the Chiefs-Eagles matchup.

The highest profile guest appearance came in the form of President Donald Trump, who made history as the first president to attend the Super Bowl while in office.

Those who tuned into the broadcast before kickoff saw a pair of A-list actors welcoming in their favorite teams. Missouri native Jon Hamm announced the arrival of the Kansas City Chiefs onto the field at the Caesars Superdome. Bradley Cooper, who hails from a Philadelphia suburb, welcomed the Eagles onto the turf.

The pre-game and halftime entertainment is packed with celebrities, too. [Jon Batiste sang the National Anthem](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5119439-who-is-singing-the-national-anthem-at-the-super-bowl/) while Kendrick Lamar and SZA were preparing for their halftime show.

Here’s a look at the celebrities spotted at Super Bowl LIX.

Donald Trump

President Trump arrived at the Caesars Superdome an hour before kickoff to meet with first responders and family members of victims in the New Year’s attack in New Orleans. He was joined in his suite by his daughter Ivanka Trump and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, among others.

His red tie may be a clue to who he’s supporting. Though he said he’s a fan of both teams, Trump predicted the Chiefs would pull out another Super Bowl win.

Bradley Cooper

Pretty easy to guess who actor Bradley Cooper was rooting for on Sunday. He welcomed his hometown team, the Philadelphia Eagles, onto the field before kickoff.

Jon Hamm did the same for his team, the Chiefs.

Taylor Swift, Ice Spice and the HAIM sisters
--------------------------------------------

Obviously Taylor Swift was in the building to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce. The pop megastar brought some friends: rapper Ice Spice and stylist Ashley Avignone. Singers Este Haim and Alana Haim, both of the group HAIM, were also in the same suite.

Jay-Z and his daughters, Blue Ivy Carter and Rumi Carter, were also on the sidelines. While fans of Beyonce were hoping she’d make an appearance – or perhaps guest star in Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show – she wasn’t spotted on the field with her family.
