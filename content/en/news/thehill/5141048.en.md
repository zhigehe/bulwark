President Trump has secured the release of a journalist jailed in Belarus, a development that follows Russia’s exchange of a jailed American as a confidence-building measure leading toward negotiations over the war in Ukraine.

Belarus released Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Andrey Kuznechyk, who served more than three years in prison on charges criticized as politically motivated.

“This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump,” Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty President Stephen Capus said in a statement.

“We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued leadership and guidance.”
