President Trump weighed in on Time Magazine’s [reveal of a cover](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5132501-el-musk-time-magazine-doge/) featuring tech billionaire Elon Musk, seemingly mocking the outlet that named him its “[Person of the Year](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5036623-donald-trump-time-person-of-year/)” in 2024.

Asked on Friday if he had a reaction to the photo illustration of Musk behind the Oval Office’s Resolute Desk, Trump shook his head.

“No,” he [said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-musk-magazine-cover-time-magazine-business-118577976) during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, “Is Time Magazine still in business? I didn’t even know that.”

His joke came after Time teased [a cover story](https://time.com/7213409/elon-musk-us-government-trump/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=politics_trump-administration&linkId=740835038) on Friday titled “Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington,” highlighting the tech giant’s [efforts to overhaul](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) the federal government during the president’s first weeks back in office.

Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) goal of cutting [wasteful spending](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133375-trump-orders-musk-review-federal-spending/), has come under scrutiny for his moves to dismantle agencies such as the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/) (USAID) and [Department of Education](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/).

DOGE’s [access to payment systems](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) at the Treasury Department, which was [temporarily blocked](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5134238-judge-blocks-doge-musk-treasury/) early Saturday by a federal judge, has also sparked concern over how much power the Trump administration has instilled in the Tesla CEO.

Still, Trump [praised Musk](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133093-trump-musk-doge-usaid-ishiba/) on Friday for doing a “great job.”

“He’s finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste,” the president told reporters during the presser. “You see it with the USAID, but you’re going to see it even more so with other agencies and other parts of government.”

“He’s got a staff that’s fantastic, he’s wanted to be able to do this for a long time,” he added.

Musk’s actions have also created a rift among [Trump supporters](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5126651-elton-musk-trump-white-house/) and [Democratic critics](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5131567-democrats-target-musk/) alike, with some questioning the [depth of his influence](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133335-elon-musk-government-power-grab/) on the White House. The administration has consistently [pushed back](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5052925-trump-pushes-back-president-musk-claims/) on claims the SpaceX founder is the one calling the shots.

After [his victory](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4969061-trump-wins-presidential-election/) over former Vice President Harris in November, Trump also graced the cover of Time. In an [interview with the outlet](https://thehill.com/business/5038821-marc-benioff-time-magazine-owner-donald-trump-person-of-year/) in December, he [outlined his goals](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5036670-donald-trump-jan-6-pardons-time-magazine/) for a second term.

In recent days, the president has also seemingly launched an offensive against mainstream media — switching up [who has access](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5111103-donald-trump-karoline-leavitt-white-house-new-media-briefing-room/) to White House and Pentagon briefing rooms, [greenlighting investigations](https://thehill.com/media/5126312-trump-targets-public-media-outlets/) into public broadcasters and celebrating [layoffs and restructuring](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5106740-donald-trump-media-criticism/) that [have signaled strife](https://thehill.com/media/5092370-trump-bump-mainstream-media/) for legacy outlets.
