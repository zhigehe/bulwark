(NEXSTAR) – During his second week in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revive plans to build a “National Garden of American Heroes,” a project he first ordered during the final year of his first presidential term.

The initial plan, as outlined in [a June 2020 executive order,](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/08/2020-14872/building-and-rebuilding-monuments-to-american-heroes) was to open the statue garden by the nation’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. During a speech at Mount Rushmore the following month, Trump suggested that his decision to sign the order came in response to what he described as “cancel culture” by “angry mobs” looking to “wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.”

These remarks came only months after the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. At the time, several monuments or statues across the country had become the target of attacks, especially those that honored figures who themselves had supported slavery.

Funding for the project, however, was never approved by Congress. President Joe Biden eventually squashed plans for the project after taking office in 2021.

On Jan. 29, 2025, however, Trump signed [Executive Order 14189](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-03/pdf/2025-02231.pdf), which, among other things, reinstated plans for the garden, to be executed “as expeditiously as possible.”

Trump also [mentioned the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW7J_pDS584&start=404) during the National Prayer Breakfast at the White House on Thursday.

“I have signed an executive order to resume the process of creating a new national park full of statues of the greatest Americans who ever lived. We’re going to be honoring our heroes, honoring the greatest people from our country. We’re not going to be tearing down, we’re going to be building up,” Trump said.

“I hope that Congress will fund this wonderfully unifying project,” he later added.

The latest executive order does not list the Americans whom the garden intends to honor with statues.

Speaking with the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/historians-question-trumps-choice-of-heroes-for-national-garden-monument/2020/07/04/4a33932a-be33-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html) after the list was revealed, James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, described some of the inclusions as “odd,” “probably inappropriate” and “provocative.” New York Daily News reporter Chris Sommerfeldt also pointed out that Woody Guthrie, a suggested honoree, once wrote a song called “Old Man Trump,” which was about — and critical of — Trump’s father, Fred Trump, accusing him of stirring up “racial hate.”

“What an incredible self-own,” Sommerfeldt [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/C_Sommerfeldt/status/1351231007287111680) (now X) in 2021.

It’s unclear whether the White House is considering making any changes to the aforementioned list of honorees. Trump’s newest executive order concerning the National Garden only stipulated that additional “American Heroes” — as suggested by the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy — be added to the list, for a total of 250.

The earlier executive orders stated that only “lifelike or realistic” statues should be included. The team in charge of the project was told to “consider the availability of authority to encourage and accept the donation or loan of statues by States, localities, civic organizations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals,” though the statues may also be commissioned.

Potential sites for the garden have yet to be disclosed, but the 2020 executive order said it should be “a site of natural beauty” that’s close to a major population center. There, the order claimed, visitors could enjoy nature while becoming “inspired to learn about great figures of America’s history.”

“None will have lived perfect lives, but all will be worth honoring, remembering, and studying,” the order stated.
