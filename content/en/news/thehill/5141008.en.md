White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt will brief reporters Wednesday afternoon as House lawmakers struggle to push through President Trump’s legislative agenda and scrutiny mounts over executive actions put forth by the president since he returned to the Oval Office.

The event comes a day after Trump met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and doubled down on his proposal to take over the Gaza Strip. He has also faced criticism over the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) moves to overhaul the government and slash federal spending.

The briefing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. EST.
