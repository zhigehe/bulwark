Former Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly predicts President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will “[get a ceasefire](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5101084-trump-pressures-putin-ukraine-deal/)” in Ukraine.

O’Reilly, in an interview on NewsNation’s “[CUOMO](https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/),” said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “has no power.”

“He has to do what the United States tells him to do. Europe wants a ceasefire, and Zelensky can’t stand by himself, so he’ll do what the compromise is,” the veteran news anchor told host Chris Cuomo.

Trump said [he and Putin](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5134714-trump-urkraine-war-talks/) have [agreed to begin](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5140775-trump-putin-talk-ukraine/) “negotiations” on ending the war, as it nears the three-year mark.

The president in a social media post Wednesday [disclosed a call](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5141716-trump-ukraine-war-negotiations/) between the two leaders, suggesting they would “work together, very closely.”

The call followed a [prisoner swap](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5140847-alexander-vinnik-marc-fogel-russia-prisoner-exchange/) that resulted in Russia releasing American schoolteacher [Marc Fogel](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia/), of Pennsylvania, after more than three years of detention.
