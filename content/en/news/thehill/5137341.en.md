President Trump will meet with King Abdullah of Jordan on Tuesday, coming days after the president floated the idea of Jordan and Egypt taking in Palestinians displaced from the Gaza Strip as the U.S. seeks to redevelop it.

Meanwhile, House Republicans are sorting out how they’ll get Trump’s legislative agenda passed.

House Budget Committee Chair [Jodey Arrington](https://thehill.com/people/jodey-arrington/)(R-Texas) floated a framework for advancing President Trump’s legislative agenda during a private meeting of panel members Tuesday morning, sources told The Hill. His committee has set a markup on a blueprint for Thursday.

Republicans [remain divided over some of the thorniest issues](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5136844-house-republicans-trump-agenda/) at the center of their plan to pass Trump’s legislative agenda, disagreements that are threatening to derail their timeline just days before the Senate is planning to advance a competing set of bills.

Follow along for updates from the White House, Congress and more.
