There are few political archetypes [more maligned](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/04/centrist-dads-are-toxic-rory-stewart/) today than the so-called “centrist dad.”

Once merely descriptive, the term has been [turned into a slur](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/31/jd-vances-sublime-take-down-of-rory-stewart-centrist-dad/) in certain circles, conjuring images of a middle-aged man in sensible shoes and — horror of horrors — advocating incremental change instead of radical upheaval. The centrist dad is portrayed as complacent, a relic of a bygone era of polite debate and cautious governance.

I am a centrist dad, and I am proud of it. Not only that, but I contend that centrist dads — and their equally essential counterparts, centrist moms — are vital to the flourishing of society. We are the ballast that keeps the ship steady. In a political era dominated by ideological extremes, we represent the virtues of pragmatism, stability and common sense. This is not complacency — it’s responsibility.

The attacks on centrism stem from a fundamental misreading of history and politics. Progressives accuse centrists of obstructing necessary transformation, whereas reactionaries deride them as weaklings lacking conviction. Both extremes misunderstand the role of centrism in a democracy, which is not about maintaining the status quo but about recognizing that the best path forward often lies in compromise, realism and adaptability.

The history of Western democracies is a testament to centrists implementing sensible, enduring reforms. It was not radicals but pragmatic leaders who built durable welfare states, created public healthcare systems, expanded rights for women and minorities and maintained economic stability. Incremental change may not be dramatic, but it is sustainable.

Centrist dads are mocked for their preference for reasoned debate and their refusal to be swept up by ideological fervor. But what’s wrong with preferring reason over hysteria? A society that values stability, evidence-based policy and rational governance is one that flourishes.

And as any parent knows, raising a child is an exercise in precisely those virtues. Good parenting requires patience, pragmatism, the ability to listen and the willingness to change when necessary. Centrist dads and moms do not impose rigid ideological blueprints on their children. They understand that the world is complex, that moral absolutism is rarely helpful and that raising  responsible citizens requires balance.

In today’s political climate, both the far left and the far right claim that centrists are a barrier to progress. But when pressed, neither camp has a viable plan for governance. The radical left offers utopian policies that collapse under scrutiny, while the hard right peddles grievance politics with no serious proposals for improving people’s lives. Neither is interested in governing, only in performative purity.

Centrists, by contrast, care about results, policies that actually work. They understand that slogans and protests mean nothing if they do not translate into tangible improvements in people’s lives. They care about economic growth, functioning infrastructure and public safety. They recognize that a flourishing society requires a mix of free markets and sensible regulation, of social compassion and personal responsibility.

There is a strange fetishization of political chaos in today’s discourse. Whether radicals calling for revolution or populists declaring war on institutions, there is a dangerous belief that disruption, in and of itself, is good. This is nonsense. Stability is underrated. Boring governance is underrated.

We should not romanticize turmoil. The best societies are those that competently manage their affairs. Centrist dads and moms appreciate this. They do not see moderation as weakness but as wisdom. They do not chase every new ideological fad, nor do they revel in nostalgia for a past that never really existed. They believe in the hard, unglamorous work of keeping society functional.

Beyond governance, centrist dads and moms provide a model of civic engagement that transcends the performative outrage so common in political discourse. They believe in voting, volunteering and engaging in public life with an open mind. They respect the importance of institutions and the rule of law, not as an unquestioned dogma but as the foundation of a stable and just society. They push for change where needed but refuse to burn everything down in the process. They teach their children to engage with ideas critically, rather than react with reflexive outrage. This quiet but persistent commitment to civic responsibility is what keeps societies strong.

Centrism recognizes the value of viewpoint multiplicity, that society is best served when diverse perspectives are engaged in good faith. Centrist dads and moms understand that ideological echo chambers stifle progress. They encourage their children, and their fellow citizens, to consider different viewpoints, even those they might ultimately reject. This openness is not a sign of weakness, but of intellectual humility and strength. A culture that fosters dialogue rather than division is one that endures and thrives.

The role of centrist parents extends to the cultural sphere as well. They champion arts, literature and education that foster critical thinking and historical awareness, rejecting both the revisionist narratives of the radical left and the nostalgic distortions of the hard right. They understand that progress does not mean erasing the past, but learning from it. Their support for balanced, well-rounded education ensures that the next generation is equipped to navigate a complex world.

There is also an often overlooked economic dimension to centrism. Centrists understand the importance of balancing market forces with social protections. They reject the naive faith in unchecked capitalism espoused by libertarians but also recognize the dangers of government intervention. They support policies that encourage innovation while ensuring that growth benefits society as a whole. This balance has been the hallmark of the most prosperous economies in history, and it is a principle worth defending.

The world does not need more demagogues. It does not need more people who see politics as a game of ideological brinkmanship. It needs more grown-ups. It needs people who understand that governance is about responsibility, not posturing.

Centrist dads and moms represent this ethos. We are not relics of the past but the foundation of a stable and prosperous future. And we should wear that label not as an insult, but as a badge of honor.
