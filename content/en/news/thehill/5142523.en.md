The House Foreign Affairs Committee is [holding a hearing](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132374-gop-house-hearing-usaids-frozen-aid/) Thursday morning looking into what GOP leadership has called the “betrayal” of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

The panel comes as President Trump’s [Department of Government Efficiency](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5139293-elites-vote-trump-musk-reform/) (DOGE), led by billionaire Elon Musk, has set its sights on [overhauling the federal agency](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/) amid its crackdown of government spending. The administration’s perceived efforts to dismantle USAID have sparked criticism across the board, with a group of House Democrats earlier this week [unveiling legislation](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5138918-democrats-usaid-doge-bill/) to stop the move.

Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, seemingly gave a thumbs up to placing USAID under the [State Department’s purview](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124136-rubio-notifies-congress-of-potential-usaid-reorganization/), after Secretary of State Marco Rubio [was named](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123282-marco-rubio-usaid-take-over/) the acting leader.

“After receiving formal consultation about the State Department’s potential reorganization of USAID, I’m excited to work with President Trump and Secretary Rubio to fix our broken foreign assistance system,” he [wrote last week](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/chairman-mast-issues-statement-on-potential-usaid-reorganization/) in a statement.

William Steiger, former chief of staff at USAID under Trump’s first term, is among the [witness list](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/the-usaid-betrayal/).

Thursday’s hearing is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. EST.
