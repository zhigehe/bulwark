Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will sit before the [Senate Banking Committee](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-little-to-no-relief-from-high-borrowing-costs-expected-as-fed-chair-powell-heads-to-the-hill/) on Tuesday morning to testify on the agency’s monetary policy.

The hearing comes as [interest rates were held steady](https://thehill.com/business/5113397-fed-hold-interest-rates-steady/) late last month following a surge of price increases. The pause came as President Trump has been [elbowing](https://thehill.com/business/5114268-trump-attacks-fed-interest-rates/) Powell to keep cutting rates to spur economic growth, [reviving tensions](https://thehill.com/business/5071561-trump-criticizes-federal-reserve-inflation/) between the White House and the Fed that were a hallmark of Trump’s first term.

Powell said last month that he would not resign from the position, even if asked to by Trump. The president [did not move](https://thehill.com/business/4979431-federal-reserve-powell-trump-demand/) to oust him, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [seemingly agreed](https://thehill.com/business/5034702-trump-pick-treasury-bessent-fed-chair/) with letting the Fed chair serve out his term.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST.
