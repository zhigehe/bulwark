You defend your neighborhood, and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense.”    For the time being, the U.S. military **doesn’t plan to cut U.S. forces** in Europe.    “It would be **the wrong planning assumption** to say, ‘Oh, America is abandoning something or America’s leaving,'” he said. “No, America’s smart.”    Roughly **100,000 U.S. troops are deployed across Europe**, with more than one-third of them based in Germany, according to the Pentagon.    But President Trump towards the end of his first term **sought to significantly reduce** American forces in the country over disagreements with German officials, a move his military leaders were able to slow walk and ultimately avoid.    Hegseth’s remarks come ahead of his participation in the **Ukraine Defense Contact Group** at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, which would make him the first major Trump administration official to visit NATO.    The **visit is significant** as many within the military alliance waiting to see how Trump plans to approach Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, including whether he will continue to fund Kyiv’s troops with weapons and equipment as President Biden did.    And after Belgium, Hegseth **plans to visit Poland** as a part of the weeklong trip.    *Read more on the Trump administration and Ukraine at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5138435-vance-bessent-zelensky-ukraine-russia-war/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Copy%20of%2002.11.25%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0Defense%20%26%20National%20Security%2C%20Feb%2011%2C%202025%2C%207:30:30%20PM).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Defense & National Security** newsletter, I’m [Ellen Mitchell](https://thehill.com/mailto:emitchell@thehill.com "emitchell@thehill.com") — your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
