House Democratic leaders are set to speak Tuesday morning as their Republican colleagues [appear divided](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5136844-house-republicans-trump-agenda/) on passing President Trump’s legislative agenda ahead of the March 14 shutdown deadline.

Democrats in Congress this week have [doubled down](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5137121-democrats-threaten-shutdown-over-trump-musk-efforts/) on their threat to [force a funding lapse](https://thehill.com/homenews/5134820-andy-kim-democrats-government-shutdown-trump/) in order to combat Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s [efforts to overhaul](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133585-elon-musk-doge-reforms/) the federal government by freezing spending and dismantling agencies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to colleagues on Monday [warning of the possibility](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5136221-schumer-trump-shutdown/) of a “Trump shutdown.”

House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) and Vice Chair Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), alongside other leaders, will deliver remarks.
