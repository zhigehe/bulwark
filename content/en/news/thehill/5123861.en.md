(NEXSTAR) — While millions are expected to tune in for Super Bowl LIX on Sunday for the game or the ads, you may have a different focus: Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show.

The Grammy-winning rapper [announced in September that he had landed the coveted gig](https://www.ktsm.com/news/rapper-kendrick-lamar-to-headline-super-bowl-lix-halftime-show), telling viewers he hoped they would “be pulling up” for the performance and encouraging them to “wear your best dress,” even if they’re tuning in from home.

The rap megastar — who, earlier this month, secured the Grammy award for Song of the Year with his diss track “Not Like Us” — previously said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL’s championship game.

We also know he won’t be alone: Fellow Grammy winner SZA [will join Lamar during the halftime performance](https://wgntv.com/news/trending/sza-to-join-kendrick-lamar-for-super-bowl-lix-halftime-show/). They share multiple hits, including “All the Stars” and “Doves in the Wind.” SZA also appeared on Lamar’s latest album, “GNX,” in songs “luther” and “gloria.” Lamar, in turn, appeared on SZA’s 2024 album “SOS Deluxe: LANA,” on the song “30 For 30.” (The pair is [also going on tour](https://wgntv.com/news/deans-list/kendrick-lamar-sza-playing-soldier-field-next-summer-in-national-tour/) this year.)

So when will Lamar and SZA take the stage?

Saying the show will start halfway through the game probably isn’t helpful. But, we can use a bit of math to give you a window of when to start tuning in.

An NFL game is split into four 15-minute quarters, two before halftime and two after. The play clock will stop and start countless times, and play will be interrupted by flags, commercial breaks and timeouts. However, the average NFL game lasts about three hours.

With kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET, that would put the start of the halftime show likely between 8 and 8:30 p.m. ET.

Super Bowl halftime shows typically run 15 minutes, giving performers the chance to play portions of roughly a dozen songs. Full tracks are not typically performed — instead, viewers can usually expect a medley.
