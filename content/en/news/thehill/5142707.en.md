Linda McMahon, [tapped](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4999123-5-things-to-know-about-linda-mcmahon-trumps-pick-for-education-secretary/) by President Trump to serve as the leader of the embattled Education Department, is set to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Thursday morning.

Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, led by [tech billionaire](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/) Elon Musk, have eyed executive actions that [would dismantle](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5126065-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge-doe-usaid/) the Education Department. Dozens of staffers have already been [put on leave](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/) in what their union has argued is a move to encourage them to resign.

Abolishing the department would take a move of Congress, but the administration can take some actions to hamper the agency’s power. Democrats [are pressing](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5130359-democrats-trump-education-department/) Trump on his moves.

Senate Democrats, ahead of the confirmation hearing, [raised concerns](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5138896-democrats-press-mcmahon-education-policy-experience/) over McMahon’s past education views and perceived “minimal” experience in the space, and will likely probe the former head of the Small Business Administration on her stance regarding student loans and tuition affordability, among other issues.

The event is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST.
