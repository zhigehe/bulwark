(NEXSTAR) – The Philadelphia Eagles have earned themselves the Vince Lombardi Trophy for defeating the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday in Super Bowl LIX. While the winning team is awarded the gleaming trophy, the individual players get to take home something even flashier: [Super Bowl rings](https://www.nfl.com/photos/the-super-bowl-rings-09000d5d82618287).

What about the losers? They also get a ring – though not one to commemorate their presence at the Super Bowl.

Super Bowl losers still get a ring honoring them as champions of their respective conference, the AFC or NFC. The ring designs vary from year to year (last year the 49ers got NFC Championship rings that [looked like this](https://www.instagram.com/oursf49ers/p/DCYNc9HRzsU/?hl=en&img_index=2)), and they are customized to the player, including their name and jersey number.

Super Bowl rings also look different every year – though they’re always flashy. The design is up to the winning team’s owner and the jeweler they work with.

Last year, the Chiefs’ 14.8-carat ring had 528 diamonds, 38 rubies – [and one big typo](https://fox4kc.com/sports/chiefs/chiefs-super-bowl-ring-features-529-diamonds-38-rubies-1-glaring-typo/). Engraved on the inside of the ring were the scores in all the Chief’s playoff games that season.

It listed them beating the No. 7 seed Miami Dolphins 26 to 7. The score was right but the seeding was not. The Dolphins were the No. 6 seed.

The mistake didn’t seem to get the Super Bowl champions down. “Who cares?” Travis Kelce said on an episode of the “New Heights” podcast. “They could have done no seeds on the side of them and I would’ve been fine. Like oh, yeah, we made it really detailed and oops, we screwed up. Just makes it more exclusive. We screwed up about something that means nothing.”

The blinged-out pieces of jewelry take a while to craft, so we don’t yet know what the design will be this year. They are awarded to winners a few months after the big game during a Super Bowl Ring Ceremony.
