Embattled nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces a final [vote of the full Senate](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5139220-kennedy-nomination-advances/) on Thursday, capping a twisting journey to become the nation’s next Health and Human Services secretary.

Kennedy’s controversial stances on vaccines and public health policies have drawn steady criticism from Democrats, as well as some Republicans. But assurances have drawn GOP senators to his side.

Another of President Trump’s contentious nominees, Kash Patel for FBI director, will come up for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday morning. Shortly afterward, Education secretary nominee Linda McMahon will [appear](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5138896-democrats-press-mcmahon-education-policy-experience/) before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions for her confirmation hearing.

Trump will welcome his second global leader this week with a [visit](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5127787-trump-invites-modi-white-house/) from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

And House Republicans face a pivotal moment on their plan to advance large swaths of Trump’s agenda as the [Budget Committee meets](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5142240-house-gop-budget-resolution/) for what could be a marathon and high-stakes meeting to advance the first step of the process.
