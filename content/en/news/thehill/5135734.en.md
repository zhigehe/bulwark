President Trump targeted Taylor Swift in a [late-night social media post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113977646169606601), arguing the pop star had a “tougher night” than the Kansas City Chiefs, after the team her boyfriend plays for lost in the [Super Bowl](https://thehill.com/homenews/5134752-live-updates-elon-musk-donald-trump-budget-dodge-treasury/).

“The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump said on Truth Social.

“She got BOOED out of the Stadium,” Trump added. “MAGA is very unforgiving!”

During Sunday evening’s Chiefs game against the Philadelphia Eagles, [the camera cut](https://www.mediaite.com/sports/taylor-swift-reacts-to-boos-after-shes-shown-on-jumbotron-at-super-bowl-lix/) to Swift, who was there to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce.

She appeared to be surprised when what The Associated Press [described](https://apnews.com/article/super-bowl-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-35c7b3b896c226566e4afa0baa7b69c5) as a pro-Philadelphia crowd began booing when she was shown on the jumbotron. Swift laughed and the camera cut away.

Last fall, the entertainer [endorsed](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4873232-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris/) former Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential run because “she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.”

Trump was also in attendance for Sunday’s championship game in New Orleans. It was the first time a sitting president had attended the Super Bowl.

During an interview that aired earlier Sunday, the president [predicted the Chiefs](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5108224-donald-trump-kansas-city-chiefs-philadelphia-eagles/) would win and praised their quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. Still, he said he was a fan of both teams and said the Eagles knew how to play well.

Late last month, Trump [took to social media](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5108224-donald-trump-kansas-city-chiefs-philadelphia-eagles/) to congratulate the Chiefs on winning the AFC championship game. He didn’t, however, say anything about the Eagles winning the NFC championship.

In 2023, after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Swift and Kelce celebrated with an on-field kiss and celebrated the win at an after party.

There was no on-field celebration for Swift and Kelce after this Super Bowl.
