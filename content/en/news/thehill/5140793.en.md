Freezing of federal grants and loans 2. Dismantling of the U.S. Agency on International Development 3. Banning birthright citizenship for the children of some immigrants   **🚨** **And another fresh lawsuit this morning**: Eight fired federal watchdogs are [suing to get their jobs back](https://thehill.com/homenews/5140474-trump-ig-agency-firings-lawsuit/?email=8b55a2c83f3ca1b2c5d365d9304a3e81875cce90&emaila=7f9db80b517c5ec4aec16dff99e2e26d&emailb=a35432e511eedb15bf53c1c36ca8fe619e436943d479f2dd797fa5c5db8a94cc&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.25%20Breaking%20IGs%20KB) after Trump ousted them.    **But Trump is actually giving Elon even more power**: Trump [signed a new executive order](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-workforce-cuts-elon-musk/) Tuesday, directing federal agencies to involve the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to carry out workforce cuts and in their hiring decisions.    **A surreal moment**: Trump [invited Musk to the Oval Office](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5139293-elites-vote-trump-musk-reform/) to stand alongside him from the resolute desk and defend his new DOGE.    *“The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get,” Musk said, defending DOGE. “That’s what democracy is all about.”*    📸 [**Trump, Musk and Musk’s son**](https://x.com/jeffmason1/status/1889413173217739065)    **The Hill’s Alex Gangitano described the moment well**: “Tuesday’s striking moment at the Oval Office featured the leader of the free world inviting the richest man in the world to give a defense of his goals in front of press brought in for the occasion. One of Musk’s young children pulled at his coat at times as the billionaire … argued the federal bureaucracy can’t have more power than any elected representative.”    **How are Republicans feeling about these moves?**: The Hill’s **Alexander Bolton** [took the temperature of Senate Republicans](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5139767-trump-respect-federal-judges/) — they want Trump to respect the rulings of the federal judges. **From Bolton:** “GOP lawmakers have been reluctant to criticize Trump’s actions, fearing it could make them targets for primary challenges next year. But they are growing increasingly worried about the nation plunging into a constitutional crisis if Trump ignores court orders halting his most aggressive actions.”    **💡** **Why this matters**: Musk, who has only been in Trump’s orbit for roughly seven months and has very little experience in governing, has singlehandedly tried to dismantle major government agencies, buy out hundreds of thousands of federal workers and take over payment systems within the Treasury Department. While Capitol Hill Republicans won’t directly bash Trump or Musk, they’re concerned about a [constitutional crisis](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5139767-trump-respect-federal-judges/) over some of their moves. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **➤  HAPPENING TODAY — THE HOUSE’S FIRST DOGE HEARING:** | | --- |  | The House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Delivering on Government Efficiency panel is holding its first hearing today. **The topic:** Improper payments and fraud. 💻 [**Watch it live**](https://thehill.com/video-clips/5140119-watch-live-house-doge-panel-improper-payments-fraud/) | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **➤  RELATED READS:** | | --- |  | * [**CNN**](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/congress-republicans-doge/index.html): Inside the GOP’s careful pushback to Musk’s DOGE effort * [**The New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html): Where Trump, Musk and DOGE Have Cut Federal Workers So Far * [**NPR**](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5293382/x-elon-musk-doge-cfpb): Elon Musk’s DOGE takes aim at agency that had plans of regulating X * **👍**[**Op-ed in The Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/elon-musks-useful-experiment-reactionary-media-might-ask-how-else-to-bring-reform-e42cb62f?mod=hp_opin_pos_2#cxrecs_s): DOGE Is Elon Musk’s Useful Experiment * **👎**[**Op-ed in The Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/11/trump-congress-courts-doge-musk/): Why DOGE is unconstitutional | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | **🏁** **On Capitol Hill** | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Inflation is a buzzing bee you can’t swat away:** | | --- |  |  | | --- |  | ©  GIPHY/GIPHY News | | --- |  | Adding in January’s [new consumer price figures](https://thehill.com/business/5140210-inflation-january-cpi/), annual inflation for the past year hit 3 percent, slightly higher than economists’ expectations.    **For context:** January is the fourth consecutive month of inflation increasing.
