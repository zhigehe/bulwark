The House Ways and Means Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday morning focused on the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) return on investment and the agency’s [modernization efforts](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-irs-will-start-simplifying-its-notices-to-taxpayers-as-agency-continues-modernization-push/).

With President Trump’s return to the White House, the tax collection agency faces significant changes this year — including the administration’s push to [extend tax cuts](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5137320-trump-expresses-confidence-democrats-will-help-extend-tax-cuts/). Democrats have [fought to protect](https://thehill.com/business/5029876-democrats-fear-more-irs-cuts-in-funding-fight-with-gop/) the $20 billion in funds that had been allocated to the IRS.

The president late last year selected former Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) to [serve as](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5023124-trump-names-billy-long-as-irs-head/) IRS commissioner.

The hearing also comes after the agency launched a free, and direct, [online tax filing system](https://thehill.com/business/4462940-irs-takes-baby-steps-with-new-direct-file-program/) — which has faced intense political scrutiny.

The event is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. EST.
