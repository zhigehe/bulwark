Kennedy Jr.**    **The vote**: 52-48. Former Senate GOP Leader **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.) was the only Republican ‚Äúno‚Äù vote. (McConnell was also the only **Tulsi** **Gabbard** ‚Äúno‚Äù vote yesterday.)    **What will Kennedy be in charge of?**: He will oversee 13 separate agencies, including a $1.7 trillion budget (that‚Äôs more than 20 percent of the U.S.‚Äôs spending).    **Tidbit:** With his confirmation today, Kennedy has become Trump‚Äôs 14th confirmed Cabinet pick.    **Backstory on RFK Jr.**: He was a longtime Democrat who turned independent. He‚Äôs an anti-vaccine activist and has promoted false claims that link vaccines to autism. He also blames chronic diseases on ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins and chemical additives. Oh, and he wants to ban fluoride in water and increase access to raw milk.

As of this morning, at least six Republicans on the committee were still undecided on whether to support the budget resolution.

Click or tap if you trust this link.")**    **Keep in mind**: House Republicans want to combine all of Trump‚Äôs legislative priorities into this one bill. However, Senate Republicans want to split it up into two bills and are working on that plan simultaneously. The White House hasn‚Äôt endorsed one plan over the other, so the competing efforts continue. Advancing the budget resolution out of committee is the House‚Äôs first step. | | --- |  | **Wrestling her own department to the ground**: | | --- |  | President Trump‚Äôs Education secretary nominee **Linda McMahon**, a former WWE executive, [is testifying](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5130236-mcmahon-education-department-senate-confirmation-hearing-trump/) for her Senate confirmation hearing.    **What makes this gig notable**: Trump wants her to gut the Education Department, the very agency she would run. ‚ÄúI told Linda, ‚ÄòLinda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job.‚Äô‚Äù    üì∏ [**Linda McMahon entering the hearing**](https://x.com/LA_Hagen/status/1890055139496747020)  **üíª**[**Hearing livestream**](https://www.c-span.org/event/senate-committee/education-sec-nominee-linda-mcmahon-testifies-at-confirmation-hearing/430797)    **Related, via NBC News:** [**‚ÄòWWE sex abuse suit raises concerns ahead of Linda McMahon‚Äôs hearing to run Education Dept.‚Äô**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wwe-sex-abuse-suit-raises-concerns-ahead-linda-mcmahons-hearing-run-ed-rcna190997) | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **‚û§ ¬†TWO LESSER-KNOWN, CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEES:** | | --- |  | Republican senators are warning that two of Trump‚Äôs lesser-known national security nominees may have extra-tough confirmation battles.   * **Elbridge Colby**, Trump‚Äôs nominee for Defense undersecretary for policy, ‚Äúis coming under criticism for advocating that the United States cut back its military posture in Europe and the Middle East to focus on the growing threat posed by China in the Indo-Pacific.‚Äù * **Darren Beattie**, Trump‚Äôs pick for undersecretary of State for public diplomacy, ‚Äúhas voiced support for sterilization and suggested paying smart people to have more kids, according to NOTUS.‚Äù   [**Read more about the red flags for two of Trump‚Äôs nominees**](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5141970-trump-nominees-colby-beattie-scrutiny/) | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **‚û§ ¬†TINA SMITH HAS HAD HER FILL:** | | --- |  | Minnesota Sen. **Tina Smith** (D) announced this morning that she [will not run for reelection](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5143053-tina-smith-not-seeking-reelection/) in 2026.

Plus, the White House is considering 30 to 40 percent budget cuts to agencies, which would mean significant cuts to staff.    **How many federal employees have taken Trump‚Äôs buyout offer?**: Roughly 77,000 employees, [per NewsNation](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/75000-federal-workers-trump-buyout/).    **The job market is bleak for these federal workers**: [The Wall Street Journal reports](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/federal-workers-jobs-doge-37b761cd?mod=hp_lead_pos3) that ‚Äúcompanies have pulled back on white-collar hiring, limiting options for government workers.‚Äù | | --- |  | **Oh to be a fly on the wall during that convo ‚Ä¶:** | | --- |  | **President Trump** [spoke with](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5140775-trump-putin-talk-ukraine/) Russian President **Vladimir Putin** for [nearly 90 minutes](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call/index.html) Wednesday ‚Äî and they agreed to ‚Äústart negotiations immediately‚Äù to end the war in Ukraine.    **What does this mean for Ukraine?**: It [would likely mean](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-backs-ukraine-early-concessions-russia-spark-concerns-2025-02-13/) Ukraine would have to give up land and could not join NATO. But it‚Äôs unclear if Ukraine would agree to that.    The New York Times‚Äôs **Andrew E.
