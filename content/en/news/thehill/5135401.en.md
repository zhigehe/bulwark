He waved to fans, shook hands with Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones, and participated in a meet-and-greet with this year’s honorary coin toss participants, including family members of victims in the New Years attack in New Orleans, city police officers and other emergency personnel.

Afterward, Trump made his way to his suite.

In his interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier — filmed Saturday but aired Sunday — [Trump predicted the Chiefs would win](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5135160-trump-picks-chiefs-super-bowl-win/) but noted that “Philadelphia has a fantastic game,” adding that “it’s going to be a great game.”

Trump went on to call himself “a big fan of both teams.”
