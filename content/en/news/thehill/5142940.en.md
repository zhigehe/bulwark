Fox News host Jessica Tarlov knocked billionaire Elon Musk over what she said is a lack of transparency he is displaying amid efforts to make widespread changes to the size of the federal government on President Trump’s behalf.

“But the real issue here is that he’s talking a big game about transparency, but he’s not being transparent himself,” Tarlov said during Martha MacCallum’s newscast on Wednesday. “This idea that Elon Musk shouldn’t have to do financial disclosures like everybody else who’s working in the government is ludicrous … and President Trump said yesterday, oh well, he doesn’t need to do it.”

The host’s comments were [first highlighted by Mediate.](https://www.mediaite.com/news/open-up-your-own-books-fox-news-host-calls-on-musk-to-be-transparent-about-his-billions-in-government-contracts/) 

Some have raised concerns that Musk’s efforts to reform the federal government could benefit his businesses and raise conflict of interest issues.

Musk on Tuesday [defended the work](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5139293-elites-vote-trump-musk-reform/) he is doing with the Department of Government Efficiency, noting his team is posting the work he is doing on the department’s X account and website.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that point during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday and said Musk has Trump’s full support.

Musk’s efforts have sparked widespread pushback from Democrats and government watchdogs while Trump has praised the billionaires promise to ride the federal government of “waste fraud and abuse.”

Tarlov is a co-host of Fox’s top-rated show “The Five” and regularly appears elsewhere across the network.
