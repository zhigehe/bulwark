An average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities hit a record of $4.95 last month, according to new data [published](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111) Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The price tag for a grade A, large egg has surpassed the previous record set in January 2023 as it was $4.82. In December last year, the same pack of eggs would on average set consumers back by $4.15.

The increase in the price of eggs comes amid the outbreak of bird flu that has caused the [death](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5092350-eggs-are-about-to-get-even-more-expensive-expert-says-heres-how-much/) of more than 100 million egg-laying hens. Experts [said](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5092350-eggs-are-about-to-get-even-more-expensive-expert-says-heres-how-much/) in January the price of eggs could increase up to 20 percent in 2025. Whenever the virus is found on a bird farm, usually all of the birds have to be killed to contain the spread.

Another factor upping the cost in states such as Oregon, Washington and California as they require eggs in stores there to be cage-free.

The egg prices increased 15.2 percent last month. In some places, including California, a carton could cost north of $9.

“This was the largest increase in the eggs index since June 2015 and it accounted for about two thirds of the total monthly food at home increase,” the Bureau of Labor Statistics [wrote](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) in a Wednesday news release.

Earlier this month, live bird markets in New York City and other surrounding counties have been [closed](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5132802-new-york-closes-live-bird-markets/) after seven bird flu cases were detected.

“Safeguarding public health is all about being proactive, and New York State is continuing our coordinated effort to monitor for the Avian Influenza,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) said.

Apart from eggs, the index for food went by 0.4 percent in January. It increased by 1.9 percent in January for meats, poultry and fish.
