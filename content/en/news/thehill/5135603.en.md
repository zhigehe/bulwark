This year’s Super Bowl marked the end of the Kansas City Chiefs’ two-year winning streak in the National Football League’s (NFL) biggest game, with the Philadelphia Eagles handily toppling their Midwestern opponents.

However, some people may not have been watching the game just for the football or rap superstar Kendrick Lamar’s mid-game performance. Some may have watched the game for the ever-entertaining commercials that always start conversation online or at the office water cooler.

Here’s five of the best advertisements from this year’s game:

**Dafoe and O’Hara play hard**
------------------------------

Two film veterans, Willem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara, [go head-to-head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAJW_-i4-kc) with younger opponents in a game that appears to be pickleball, and seem to excel at the sport in an ad for Michelob Ultra. The two movie legends prove to not only be able to give energetic performances on the screen, but on the court as well.

**Shannon and Plaza aren’t sweet**
----------------------------------

Actors Aubrey Plaza and Michael Shannon give us [their best scowls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjINFAdmhI) in this advertisement while at the “Ritz Salty Club” and enjoy some Ritz.

**Moustaches to the rescue?**
-----------------------------

This Pringles [advertisement featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAOFSKaIXms) the moustaches of multiple people including actor Nick Offerman coming to life in an attempt to retrieve Pringles. Fully entertaining.

**Harry and Sally reunite**
---------------------------

“When Harry Met Sally” actors Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan grab a bite to eat, featuring a [risque reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX9qfSEKyuc) to the film classic and a cameo by “Euphoria” actor Sydney Sweeney for this Hellman’s ad.

**Glen Powell takes on fairy tales**
------------------------------------

One of the hottest actors of last summer puts his own twist on a classic fairy [tale in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9ot1x4oEaQ) ad for Ram. It’s slightly different from the original.
