The moves at the CFPB have drawn **parallels with USAID**, where staff were also told to stay out of headquarters and cease work before the Trump administration attempted to place thousands of employees on administrative leave.    The Trump administration launched its blitz attack on the consumer watchdog over the weekend, not long after newly confirmed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director **Russell Vought** was appointed acting CFPB director on Friday.    “The Bureau’s current balance of $711.6 million is in fact excessive in the current fiscal environment,” Vought wrote in a post on the social platform X. “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off.”    Vought, co-author behind the controversial conservative policy blueprint known as Project 2025, had already become a frequent target of Democratic attacks in recent weeks as senators considered his nomination to head up the OMB.    His position on the Impoundment Control Act, which sets limits on the president’s powers to restrict funding approved by Congress, has also drawn attention. While Vought has vowed the administration will uphold the law, he has reiterated his position in hearings that the measure is **unconstitutional**.

| | --- |  | **Republicans eye carried interest tax break** | | --- |  | Republicans are looking at canceling a **controversial tax break** used by private equity firms and hedge funds as a way to help pay for the tax cuts they want to extend by the end of this year.    The so-called **carried interest loophole** allows investment companies to mark down the income they receive as profit shares in their assets as capital gains, rather than as wage or salary income.    In many cases, this allows them to pay an effective tax rate of **23.8 percent** rather than **37 percent** – a substantial reduction.    **President Trump** is concerned that the extension of his 2017 tax cuts will be perceived as overly favorable to the **wealthiest Americans**, a number of Republicans told The Hill. Nixing the carried interest tax break, which former President Biden proposed more than once, could be a way to soften those perceptions.    “If the president is interested, I’m sure it will be looked at. We’ll see where we go from there,” Rep. **Frank Lucas** (R-Okla.) told The Hill.    Asked whether he thought the Republican conference could get behind the move, Lucas said he thought that was “too complicated a question at this stage.”    *— Tobias Burns* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   {{if !contains(profile.lists,”Evening Report”)}   | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |   {/if}}{{if !contains(profile.lists,”Evening Report”)}   | | | COMING UP | | --- |  | *The Hill’s **Evening Report** breaks down the day’s big political stories and looks ahead to tomorrow. **[Click here to sign up & get it in your inbox](https://cb.sailthru.com/join/7aa/cross-promo-signup-confirm?sailthru_vars%5Bcross_promo_signup_evening_report%5D=1&sailthru_lists%5BEvening%20Report%5D=1&email=email&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL)*** | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   {/if}}   | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **The Ticker** | | --- |  | *Upcoming news themes and events we’re watching:* | | --- |  | * The consumer price index (CPI) reading for **January** is slated to come out Wednesday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. * Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers his semiannual monetary policy report to the **House Financial Services Committee** at 10 a.m. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **In Other News** | | --- |  | *Branch out with more stories from the day:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | [I'm an image](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-trump-steel-aluminum-imports-likely-to-drive-up-car-costs-industry-leaders-say/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL) | | --- |  | **[Trump steel, aluminum tariffs likely to drive up car costs, industry leaders say](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-trump-steel-aluminum-imports-likely-to-drive-up-car-costs-industry-leaders-say/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL)** | | --- |  | DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel imports this week could wreak havoc … | | --- |  | [Full Story](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-trump-steel-aluminum-imports-likely-to-drive-up-car-costs-industry-leaders-say/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **Good to Know** | | --- |  | *Business and economic news we’ve flagged from other outlets:* | | --- |  | * Trump Media grants large amounts of stock to directors ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/investing/trump-media-shares-board/index.html?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL)) * Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.2025%20Business%20%26%20Economy%20SL)) * The Eagles Are Super Bowl Champions.
