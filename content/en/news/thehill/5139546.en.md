The rule [requires all publicly traded companies](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4512578-sec-final-climate-disclosure-rule/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%20%E2%80%94%20Energy%20%26%20Environment%20%E2%80%94%20CMS%20RF%20BH) to **publicly detail the risks that climate change poses** to their business.    It also forces large companies to **tell the public about greenhouse gas emissions** directly caused by their business if that information would be likely to influence someone’s decision on whether to invest.    The commission’s refusal to defend the rule from court challenges makes it **more likely to be overturned.**    When the rule was finalized last year, it was approved by the commission in a  3-2 party line vote.    Since that time, two Democratic commissioners have parted from the agency and it now has a **2-1 Republican majority**.    *Read more at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5138697-sec-rejects-climate-disclosure-rule/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.11.25%20%E2%80%94%20Energy%20%26%20Environment%20%E2%80%94%20CMS%20RF%20BH).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Energy & Environment** newsletter, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk — keeping you up to speed on the policies impacting everything from oil and gas to new supply chains. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
