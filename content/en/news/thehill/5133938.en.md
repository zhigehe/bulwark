The [cost of homeownership](https://thehill.com/business/5092459-housing-crisis-cost-of-living/) rose in 201 of 226 — or 89 percent — of measured metro areas in the fourth quarter of 2024.

That’s according to the latest [quarterly report](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/metropolitan-median-area-prices-and-affordability) from the National Association of Realtors, which also showed a bump in 30-year fixed mortgage rates, from 6.12 percent to 6.85 percent.

“Record-high home prices and the accompanying housing wealth gains are definitely good news for property owners,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “However, renters who are looking to transition into homeownership face significant hurdles.”
