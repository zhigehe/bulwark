Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Christopher Knittel agreed that the **low cost of solar** will be “driving a lot of adoption, because it’s just a cheap source of electricity.”    The unsubsidized cost of solar power **dropped almost 85 percent** between 2010 and 2023, according to the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/power-sector-evolution?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.10.2025--Overnight%20Energy%20%26%20Environment%20CMS%20BH#:~:text=This%20is%20because%20coal%2Dfired,in%20the%20total%20energy%20mix.).
