Any security guarantees for the war-torn country “must be **backed by capable European and non-European** troops,” the Trump Cabinet official said.    President Trump often lamented on the campaign trail last year that Washington was spending too much money on aid for Ukraine and has long pushed for NATO members to **increase their spending on defense**.    Hegseth said Wednesday he wanted to “directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,” noting Washington is “**focusing on securing our own border**.”    He also said **it is “unrealistic”** to try to return Ukraine’s borders to what they were before 2014 — when Russia annexed Crimea — indicating that the United States will push a negotiation between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war in which Ukraine cedes territory.    Some critics suggested Hegseth’s comments may have **taken away some of Ukraine’s leverage** in negotiations, though Trump brushed off a question about whether that was the case.    Trump spoke earlier in the day with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin and made clear in both calls that his administration was **pushing to begin negotiations** to end the war in Ukraine. The conflict began in February 2022 when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.    “No one wants peace more than Ukraine,” Zelensky posted on the social platform X after his call with Trump. “Together with the U.S., we are **charting our next steps** to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”    *Read the full report at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5140389-hegseth-nato-membership-ukraine-russia/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.12.25%20Defense%20%26%20National%20Security%20JB).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Defense & National Security** newsletter, I’m Ellen Mitchell — your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?
