Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) commended President Trump for coordinating the release of American Marc Fogel from Russian detainment.

“Marc Fogel’s return home is long overdue—and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,” Fetterman wrote in a Tuesday statement.

“I commend President Trump and Steve Witkoff for their efforts in finally bringing Marc home.”

The [White House announced](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5138791-trump-russia-detainee-release-fogel/) special envoy Witkoff left Russian airspace with Fogel this morning.

The American is a Pennsylvania native who taught history prior to being sentenced to 14 years in prison for traveling with prescribed medical marijuana.

He was first arrested in 2021. Fetterman advocated for Fogel’s release in a [January letter](https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25.1.23-PA-Delegation-Fogel-Letter.pdf) to Secretary of State Marco Rubio alongside other lawmakers.
