The “**move things fast and break things**” approach is reminiscent of Musk’s leadership at his other companies, notably X, where the billionaire, surrounded by a group of loyal deputies, slashed programs and fired employees he deemed unnecessary.    Musk’s leadership style, described by critics as **reckless** and by allies as **intense**, is central to his polarizing influence in the tech world.    Now, he’s bringing that attitude to Washington as Trump tasks him with leading efforts to reduce the federal workforce.    “Because there’s such energy behind different initiatives, it seems like they’re willing not just to go fast and break things, but to shake things up and go until you’re told, ‘No,'” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University.    The tech leader’s execution of the DOGE task force mimics many of the steps he took after purchasing the **social media platform X**, then known as Twitter, in 2022.    [The chaotic takeover](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4279905-elon-musks-twitter-is-a-44-billion-albatross-a-year-later/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB) was marked by the quick firings of top executives, a reduction in at least half of the company’s workforce and a rollback of some policies, often regardless of how the shift could impact the company.    In an email in 2022, Musk encouraged company employees to leave or commit to being “extremely hardcore.” The subject line was **“A Fork in the Road.”**    Nearly two years later, hundreds of thousands of federal employees received emails this week with the same “Fork in the Road” subject line that offered a **deferred resignation**, promising staffers would retain their full salary and benefits without working through Sept. 30.    “The subject title…he didn’t even bother to change it at all, and it was on purpose too, like a f— you,” one federal employee who received the email told The Hill on the condition of anonymity.    [Like with his X takeover](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-adds-allies-twitter-staff-plans-layoffs-for-monday-2022-10?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB), Musk has installed a tight-knit team of allies to orchestrate DOGE’s campaign. Many of these staffers are young adults with ties to his other companies, but little to no prior government work.    ***Read more in a full report this weekend at** [**TheHill.com**.](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB)* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Technology newsletter**, we’re Julia Shapero and Miranda Nazzaro — tracking the latest moves from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?

House Financial Services Chair **French Hill** (R-Ark.) and Rep. **Bryan Steil** (R-Wis.), the chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, unveiled a discussion draft of a bill Thursday to create a framework for dollar-backed stablecoins.    Their draft bill comes just days after Sen. **Bill Hagerty** (R-Tenn.) introduced stablecoin legislation in the upper chamber.    Hagerty was joined on the legislation by fellow GOP Sens. **Tim Scott** (S.C.) and **Cynthia Lummis** (Wyo.), as well as Democratic Sen. **Kirsten Gillibrand** (N.Y.).    Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to other assets in order to maintain a more stable price.    Republicans lawmakers had identified stablecoin legislation as a priority earlier this week, when they announced a **bicameral crypto working group**.    Their other main focus, market structure, has yet to see any firm movement. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **The Refresh** | | --- |  | *News we’ve flagged from**t**he intersection of tech and other topics:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | * Google Brain founder supports company dropping weapon- AI pledge ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/andrew-ng-is-very-glad-google-dropped-its-ai-weapons-pledge/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB)) * DOGE staffer was fired by cybersecurity firm for allegedly leaking company secrets ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/musk-s-doge-teen-was-fired-by-cybersecurity-firm-for-leaking-company-secrets?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NzgyMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYyNjIxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJXMTlUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIyQjE3NzFFOTlEODc0QzRDOTY1Njg1RTZBQkJGM0QwRCJ9.PzPv9vq6-ukfVt3y5WF0PBy_lGW7WBwsNaXdP8fUOSo&email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB)) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **In Other News** | | --- |  | *Branch out with other reads on The Hill:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | [I'm an image](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5132717-trump-administration-suspends-electric-vehicle-charging-network/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB) | | --- |  | [**Transportation Department suspends $5 billion EV charger program**](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-technology/ap-how-tiktok-grew-from-a-fun-app-for-teens-into-a-potential-national-security-threat/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.07.25%20Technology%20JB) | | --- |  | The Federal Highway Administration (FHA) on Thursday announced the suspension of a Biden-era electric vehicle (EV) charging network, the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to gut its predecessors’ energy and environmental moves.
