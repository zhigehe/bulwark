Last week, during his confirmation hearings for secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tried to present himself as a moderate voice on abortion.

He claimed to have had a “change of heart” on the issue, [expressing newfound reservations](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/nicole-shanahan-robert-kennedy-abortion/index.html) about late-term procedures and suggesting he would consider policies that “reflect the values of all Americans.”

But let’s be clear: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spent his entire career advocating for abortion on demand, and his nomination is further proof that Donald Trump is no champion of the anti-abortion cause.

For years, Kennedy has aligned himself with the most extreme elements of the abortion rights lobby. He has been a vocal [supporter](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-other-populist-in-the-race/) of taxpayer-funded abortion and even the radical idea that [abortion should be legal until birth](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/rfk-jr-backs-15-week-federal-ban-on-abortion-00111017) with no restrictions. His commitment to this ideology isn’t just rhetorical — it’s deeply ingrained in his policy positions.

He has consistently endorsed the agenda of Planned Parenthood and NARAL, organizations that have worked tirelessly to eliminate any protections for the unborn and silence pro-life voices. Now, in an apparent effort to ease concerns among conservatives, Kennedy is suddenly signaling a more nuanced approach. But this isn’t a sincere evolution — it’s a politically convenient act.

Kennedy has never supported meaningful pro-life protections, and his record speaks louder than any carefully crafted statements made under the bright lights of a confirmation hearing. His nomination also exposes the lie that Donald Trump is the “[most pro-life president in American history.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-hes-proud-most-pro-life-president-history-anniversary-roe-v-wade-overturn)“

Trump has repeated this claim ad nauseam, pointing to his judicial appointments and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But actions speak louder than words. If Trump were truly committed to the pro-life movement, he would not be nominating someone like Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency that oversees critical policies related to life and family.

The HHS secretary plays a pivotal role in shaping abortion policy in the United States. Under the Biden administration, HHS was transformed into an advocacy arm for abortion rights extremism, [rolling back conscience protections for doctors](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4397912-biden-administration-rescinds-much-of-trump-conscience-rule-for-health-workers/), [expanding abortion pill access](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/biden-administration-new-steps-protect-contraceptives-abortion-medication/story?id=106562383) and [funding overseas abortion groups](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-rescinds-abortion-restrictions-on-u-s-foreign-aid). If Kennedy is confirmed, we can expect more of the same. He will wield his authority to entrench abortion in federal policy, making it even more difficult for states to pass life-affirming laws and for anti-abortion medical professionals to exercise their conscience rights.

Pro-life Americans cannot be fooled by empty words and strategic pivots. We’ve seen this playbook before.

Politicians who claim to “evolve” on abortion when it is convenient almost always revert to their radical stances once in power. Kennedy’s record is clear, and the pro-life movement should reject his nomination unequivocally.

Trump’s decision to elevate Kennedy should also serve as a wake-up call. The movement cannot afford to give blind loyalty to any politician — especially one who has demonstrated time and again that he is willing to compromise on the issue of protecting human life. If Trump truly believed in protecting the unborn, he would never have chosen someone with Kennedy’s history. The fact that he did should make every voter that opposes abortion question where his priorities lie.

The pro-life movement must remain steadfast in its principles and hold leaders accountable, no matter their party. We fought for decades to overturn Roe v. Wade, but that victory was never the end goal — it was just the beginning. We cannot allow an administration that claims to be pro-life to install an HHS secretary who will work against everything we stand for.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be one of the most pro-abortion rights HHS secretaries in American history.

His nomination is an insult to the millions of Americans who believe in the dignity of life. And if Trump truly cared about protecting the unborn, he would withdraw this nomination immediately. Until then, the pro-life movement must stand strong in opposition because when it comes to defending life, there can be no room for radical pro-abortion rights extremism.
