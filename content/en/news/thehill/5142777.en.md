House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) is set to hold his weekly press conference Thursday morning as [frustrations grow](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5141657-democrats-push-stronger-response-trump/) among Democrats over President Trump’s executive actions and efforts to dismantle parts of the federal government.

With the mid-March government shutdown deadline looming, House Republicans [unveiled a blueprint](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5140539-house-republicans-budget-resolution-trump-agenda/) for the budget resolution that they intend to use to advance Trump’s legislative agenda. Jeffries has [threatened to use](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5123216-jeffries-government-shutdown-trump-orders/) the spending fight as a weapon to block the Trump administration’s moves to gut federal programs.

Democrats in the lower chamber of Congress also [announced earlier this week](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5136566-house-democrats-trump-administration-task-force/) the creation of a task force to respond to the “harm” inflicted by the president since he returned to the Oval Office last month.

The presser is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. EST.

Watch the live video above.
