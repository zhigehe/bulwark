Two of President Trump’s most controversial Cabinet nominees face floor votes Wednesday in the Senate.

Tulsi Gabbard, who advanced through the upper chamber despite significant Republican skepticism, [could be confirmed](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5137083-tulsi-gabbard-nomination-dni-advances/) as the director of national intelligence. The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services will be up for a key procedural vote.

It’s also a bustling day elsewhere on Capitol Hill, with the Senate Budget Committee [starting work](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5126273-senate-budget-package-house-stalemate/) on a resolution that will unlock the process by which Republicans hope to pass large swaths of Trump’s agenda. The House and Senate have been racing to lead the process, and while House GOP leaders hope to start their effort Thursday, [some are skeptical](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5139601-house-republicans-doubt-budget-resolution/) the razor-thin majority can find a way to move forward.

And the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) panel, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), convenes its first hearing.

House Democrats, meanwhile, are ready to play hardball on government spending, with funding set to run out March 14. They are driving to [extract steep concessions](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5139561-democrats-shutdown-republicans-concessions/) from Republicans who will need bipartisan buy-in to prevent a shutdown next month.

At the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt will give a briefing hours after January inflation numbers were released, showing the consumer price index [ticking up to a 3 percent increase](https://thehill.com/business/5140210-inflation-january-cpi/) in January.
