President Trump is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday in the second visit by a foreign leader to the White House this week.

Trump will host a joint press conference with Ishiba, who took office in October [and told reporters](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ishiba-us-japan-cd84a0e7306ab4b8b7e03bc8b76aa06c) before departing for Washington that his goal was to forge a “personal relationship” with Trump.

The two leaders are expected to discuss training exercises, foreign investments in the U.S., semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and energy exports, administration officials previewed in a call early Friday.

The long-running alliance between the U.S. and Japan is expected to be highlighted by both leaders, [though a proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel](https://thehill.com/business/5019060-trump-opposes-nippon-steel-acquisition/) by a Japanese company has proved to be a sticking point between the two nations.

Meanwhile, House Republicans are [working through the weekend](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132110-speaker-johnson-house-lawmakers-to-work-through-weekend-amid-trump-agenda-stalemate/) to break a stalemate over advancing Trump legislative agenda as lawmakers race to complete the final details of the sprawling package. The Senate is threatening to move on its own contrasting strategy.
