Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) slammed President Trump over [his promise](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5051314-trump-campaign-promises-difficulties/) to lower [everyday costs](https://thehill.com/business/4984278-trump-second-term-businesses-preparing/) for Americans, asking “How’s that going?”

“Donald Trump ran on a promise to bring down costs for everyday people, but didn’t have a plan for it, but said he would,” Pressley said Monday at a rally. “Well, Donald, how’s that going?”

“I’ll ask you all,” she continued, addressing the public. “How’s it going? Are your eggs cheaper? Is your housing more affordable?”

The crowd, gathered to protest the Trump administration’s [efforts to shutter](https://thehill.com/business/5136827-trump-administration-targets-cfpb/) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), shouted back, “No!”

The demonstration Monday was organized by CFPB workers outside their headquarters in Washington. They are [protesting](https://thehill.com/business/5133683-democrats-doge-stop-work-order-cfpb-musk-trump/) tech billionaire Elon Musk, and the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/)‘s (DOGE) aim to slash federal spending.

In recent weeks, [officials at DOGE](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5133585-elon-musk-doge-reforms/) have gained access to various federal departments and agencies, looking to overhaul the federal government’s budget. Democrats are sounding the alarm about Musk, an unelected official, [having access](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133335-elon-musk-government-power-grab/) to Americans’ confidential information, including tax records.

“Last week, I saw a sign in the crowd that said ‘DOGE stands for Dangerous Oligarchs Grab at Everything,’” Pressley said at the rally. “And I said it then and I’ll say it again, that Elon Musk needs to keep his … greedy, grubby hands off our government.”

She expressed concern for her daughter’s generation and the future they will have in this country as the federal government undergoes changes that may have years-long impacts.

CFPB was created by Congress after the 2008 financial crash as a way to protect people from getting swindled by various companies.

Fellow Massachusetts lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) [was also at the rally,](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5136967-warren-on-efforts-to-shutter-cfpb-no-one-can-fire-the-financial-cops/) expressing concern that the Trump administration will shut down the CFPB to benefit Musk and his payment platform “X Money.”

“CFPB is there to make sure Elon Musk’s new project cannot scam you and steal your personal data,” she said, adding that’s why Musk was targeting the agency.
