**How is Alibaba leveraging AI and IoT to transform its business operations?**

Alibaba is at the forefront of using cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to revolutionize its business strategies and operations. AI is deeply integrated into Alibaba’s logistics, enhancing the precision of its recommendation systems and optimizing supply chain processes. The company employs AI to analyze consumer behavior, forecast trends, and make data-driven decisions, which streamline operations and significantly boost consumer engagement.
