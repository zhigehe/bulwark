Clorox, a household name known for its bleach, Kingsford charcoal, and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, recently experienced a 10.1% drop in its stock price.

The company projects organic sales growth between 3% to 5% this fiscal year, alongside a significant increase in adjusted earnings per share. Clorox is doubling down on its most profitable brands, indicating a clear shift towards strategic advertising investments instead of drastic cost-cutting.

In a market where every percentage point in operating margin can mean millions, Clorox is keen on proving that its long-term strategy will pay off.
