The X account of Semler Scientific [chairman Eric Semler](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/12/10/eric-semler-following-micro-strategy-s-lead) has seemingly been compromised, with various posts from it pointing to the supposed creation of a Solana-based token under the same trading symbol that the firm trades under at Nasdaq.

The account shared a post suggesting that the token is looking to bridge "institutional-grade Bitcoin exposure to a high-performance ecosystem with deep liquidity and low fees" by launching the token on Solana.

Other posts suggest a large percentage of the token's supply has been sent to leading cryptocurrency exchanges.

A newly launched token trading on Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium under the ticker symbol SMLR, whose address matches the one sent to the hacked account's posts, saw a 300% rise after launch before seeing a massive plunge.

The token is now down 77% from its peak, according to [DEXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/89vmcvjqfafapg1bsyew4fw56jerdkrfu2bvdqqbdmyd) data.

CoinDesk has reached out to Semler Scientific for comment.
