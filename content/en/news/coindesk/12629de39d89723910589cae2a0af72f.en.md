* Ether’s underperformance is influenced by factors including its circulating supply surpassing pre-Merge levels and the SEC’s delay in listing options contracts for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust.
* Yet ether’s price mirrors a pattern seen before a previous bullish run, which could potentially signal an upward move.
* Strong over-the-counter demand for ETH could lead to a surprise bounce once the market stabilizes.
