* Ether is showing signs of a potential rebound after hitting its weakest price ratio against bitcoin recently, with longer-term investors stepping in buying the recent dip in prices, LMAX strategist Joel Kruger said.
* Traders should watch for a breakout above $2,650, as oversold RSI technical indicators while upcoming catalysts like next month's Pectra upgrade and potentially favorable U.S. inflation data could drive momentum, 10x Research noted.
* The next key resistance level is around $3,000, offering a 13% potential gain.
