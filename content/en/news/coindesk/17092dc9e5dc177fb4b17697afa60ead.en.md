Alongside a number of other digital asset-related firms, institutional crypto custody company BitGo is considering an initial public offering as soon as this year, [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/crypto-custody-firm-bitgo-said-to-weigh-ipo-as-soon-as-this-year?sref=3REHEaVI).

Among the backers of the Mike Belshe-led BitGo are Goldman Sachs, DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures and Valor Equity Partners. The company's most recent funding round in 2023 valued it at $1.75 billion.

Other crypto firms mulling an IPO in the wake of bitcoin's move to $100,000 and a friendlier U.S. regulatory environment include exchanges Gemini, Kraken and Bullish (the parent of CoinDesk), and stablecoin issuer Circle.
