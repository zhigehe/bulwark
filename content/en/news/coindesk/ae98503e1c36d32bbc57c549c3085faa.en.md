* Loans from Galaxy and Ripple played a role in helping crypto exchange MoonPay handle demand for Donald Trump’s official memecoin.
* The massive demand came on a Saturday, when MoonPay’s fiat accounts were inaccessible due to the weekend with a public holiday on the following Monday for the swearing-in.
* The situation meant MoonPay could not readily access over $100 million in liquidity required to meet TRUMP’s trading demand
