GameStop (GME) is considering investments in alternative asset classes, bitcoin (BTC) and crypto among them, [reported CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/gamestop-is-considering-investing-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-sources-say.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&par=sharebar), citing three sources.

The report comes just a few days after GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen [posted a picture](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1888098643732811864) of himself with Strategy (MSTR) founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Formerly MicroStrategy, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin with more than 400,000 tokens.

GameStop would seem to have a decent amount of buying firepower, reporting $4.6 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of the [end of the third quarter](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-discloses-third-quarter-2024-results) and total liabilities of less than $1.5 billion.

GME shares are higher by 11.3% in after hours trading. The news also appears to be giving a modest lift to bitcoin, which has risen to $96,700.
