While major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) and ether ([ETH](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/)) are evolving into institutional-led macro assets, smaller and lesser-known coins remain as unpredictable as ever, rallying on random factors completely disconnected from the broader market.

For instance, after billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla CEO [Elon Musk changed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms) his account name on X to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, the price of the illiquid HARRYBOLZ token surged 127% against SOL, according to data source [Gecko Termina](https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/pools/9DjkrppH3bDEwnhp61EycVH7rVPN3C2vRrNccyo4dHrv)l. The token has a 24-hour trading volume of just over $4 million and a market capitalization of $17.35 million.
