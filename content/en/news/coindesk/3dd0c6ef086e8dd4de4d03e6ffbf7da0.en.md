Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering classifying crypto assets as financial products similar to securities in a move to enhance investor protection by requiring businesses to disclose more information, [Nikkei](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB05DTK0V00C25A2000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&n_tw=1739133495) reported.

The FSA is conducting a closed study session with experts to asses current regulations. Once that's complete, the agency plans to announce regulatory reforms by June, Nikkei said.

Any reforms could may enhance the attractiveness of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), should they become available. In August, the boss of the FSA said “[cautious consideration](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/08/japans-top-regulator-says-crypto-etf-approvals-need-cautious-consideration-report)” needs to be given to any decision to approve crypto-related ETFs.
