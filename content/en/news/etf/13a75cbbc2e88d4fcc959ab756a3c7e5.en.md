BlackRock's [**iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)**](https://ibit) and [**Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)**](https://fbtc) led another week of inflows, as investors doubled the amount of money they are betting on spot bitcoin ETFs amid a flurry of policy announcements from the Trump Administration.

Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $1.1 billion in the five trading days ending Tuesday, soaring from the previous five-day period's $515.9 million, according to etf.com data.

The steady flow of assets comes as bitcoin's price fell to around $98,000, down more than 1.3% over the past 24 hours, while world markets absorbed news of President Trump's announcement—and then pause—of 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. Investors are piling into bitcoin funds as the Trump administration continues promoting cryptocurrencies and as the funds transition in their functions as hedges against inflation.

Since their January 2024 launch, [spot bitcoin ETFs](/topics/bitcoin) have drawn $40.6 billion in new assets—a stark contrast to [Ethereum ETFs](/topics/ethereum) that pulled in just $3.2 billion since their July 23 debut, according to Farside Investors in the U.K.

IBIT attracted $905.9 million over the five days, according to etf.com fund flows data, even as the White House ordered nearly three million federal employees to return to offices or face termination—a move that unnerved investors.

FBTC added $49.7 million during the period, while [**Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)**](/arkb) gathered $53.6 million as the Securities and Exchange Commission signaled a potential shift in its enforcement approach, including reducing the size of its crypto enforcement unit as part of Trump's efforts to promote growth and reduce oversight of the industry.

Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Edge in Volatile Week
-------------------------------------------

While large bitcoin funds dominated inflows, the [**Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)**](/gbtc) showed signs of stabilizing with outflows slowing to $3.1 million during the five days. Its Ethereum counterpart, [**Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)**](/ethe), continued to struggle with $72 million in outflows.

As global markets processed news of U.S.-Israel plans for Gaza control and escalating trade tensions with China, BlackRock's [**iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA)**](/etha) gathered $422.9 million over the five days.

Against this backdrop of global uncertainty, Ethereum's price dropped nearly 11.5% over seven days compared to bitcoin's 4.7% decline, highlighting the different market reactions to the week's developments.

The CoinMarketCap Fear & Greed Index, a measure of crypto market sentiment, sat at 38 during the period, reflecting investor caution. Meanwhile, the [**Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH)**](/feth) added $98.1 million to its assets, even as markets digested the flurry of policy shifts from Washington.

Year-to-date figures show the divergence in investor preference, with bitcoin ETFs pulling in $5.3 billion while Ethereum products have attracted $492.9 million, according to etf.com data.
