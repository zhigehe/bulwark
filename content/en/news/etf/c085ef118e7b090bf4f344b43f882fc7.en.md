Steel and aluminum stocks, along with the [**VanEck Steel ETF (SLX)**](https://www.etf.com/SLX), rose following the announcement of new tariffs on imported metals.

This protectionist measure is expected to reduce competition for domestic producers. Major players in the steel industry, like Charlotte, North Carolina-based [Nucor Corp. (NUE)](https://www.etf.com/stock/NUE), and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-headquartered [US Steel Corp (X)](https://www.etf.com/stock/X), both top holdings in the SLX ETF, climbed on Monday.

The tariffs are anticipated to boost domestic steel and aluminum prices, increasing profitability for US producers. Reduced competition may lead to higher market share for domestic companies, driving revenue growth.

The long-term impact of these tariffs on the broader economy remains uncertain, as these tariffs carry potential risks. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries could harm US exports and negatively impact the broader economy. Additionally, increased production costs for industries reliant on steel and aluminum could fuel inflationary pressures.

US steel and aluminum manufacturers touch multiple industries, including auto manufacturing, construction, infrastructure, and national defense, [according to data](https://www.steel.org/steel-markets/) from the American Iron and Steel Institute.

SLX rose 3.4% on Monday.

Why SLX, US Steel Stocks Are Rising on New Tariffs
--------------------------------------------------

Tariffs on steel and aluminum increase prices for U.S. steel stocks and ETFs like SLX by creating a more favorable pricing environment for domestic producers. Here's how:

* **Reduced Foreign Competition:** Tariffs make imported steel and aluminum more expensive, reducing competition from foreign producers. This allows US companies to raise prices without losing market share.
* **Higher Domestic Steel Prices:** With fewer cheap imports, domestic steelmakers can charge more for their products, boosting revenue and profit margins.
* **Increased Demand for US Steel:** Many US manufacturers switch to domestic suppliers to avoid tariffs, driving higher sales for US steel companies.
* **Improved Earnings & Valuations:** Higher steel prices and demand increase profitability, leading to higher stock valuations as investors anticipate stronger financial performance.
* **Government Infrastructure Spending:** Tariffs often come alongside policies that support US manufacturing, such as infrastructure bills, which further drive demand for steel and aluminum.

In summary, tariffs can act as a protective measure for US steelmakers, allowing them to sell at higher prices and improve their financial health, which in turn supports higher stock prices in the sector. However, the potential risk of retaliatory measures from other countries and inflationary pressures remains.
