In Q3FY25, the private lender's credit cards volumes witnessed a degrowth of 2 percent QoQ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank are likely to see a positive reaction on February 13 after the Reserve Bank of India lifted curbs on its digital banking operations. Nearly 10 months after the embargo was imposed, the bank can once again issue new credit cards and onboard customers via its website and mobile app. Brokerages responded positively to this development, seeing it as a major catalyst for growth.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its "overweight" rating on Kotak Bank and shared highest target price of Rs 2,290 apiece, stating that the lifting of restrictions would reignite growth in unsecured lending while enhancing the bank’s ability to manage margins more effectively than its peers.

JPMorgan echoed this optimism, maintaining its "overweight" stance with a target price of Rs 2,100, citing the potential for stronger unsecured loan growth in the medium to long term.

"A revamped digital app, and a potential peaking of credit card slippages at the system level would push Kotak Mahindra Bank's acquisitions here," added JPMorgan analysts.

HSBC also welcomed the move, underlining its role in strengthening the bank’s customer franchise, which, in turn, would enhance earnings prospects and stock valuations.

"This development would allow the bank to resume digital customer acquisition, saving the costs it would have otherwise required to build a physical distribution network," added HSBC, maintaining a "buy" rating and raising target price to Rs 2,210 from Rs 2,100 per share.

Meanwhile, UBS adjusted its projections, increasing Kotak Bank’s FY26-27 EPS estimates by 3-4 percent and anticipating a gradual acceleration in new deposit customer acquisitions in H1FY26. The firm held its "neutral" rating but raised its target price to Rs 2,100 from Rs 1,950 per share.

In the October-December quarter, the private lender's credit cards volumes witnessed a degrowth of 2 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 14,117 crore, while it grew by a modest 2 percent YoY from Rs 13,881 crore in the year-ago period.

During an analyst call, the bank’s management acknowledged that the RBI’s restrictions had significantly impacted growth in unsecured lending, particularly in credit cards, personal loans, and microfinance. The crackdown had pushed the share of these loans down to 10.5 percent of total assets, well below the bank’s target of 15 percent.
