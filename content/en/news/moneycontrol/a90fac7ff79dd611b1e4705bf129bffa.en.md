**Market Performance**

On February 12, the Indian equity markets closed on a flat note, experiencing significant volatility throughout the trading session. For a sixth consecutive session, the Indian equity market continued to loose wherein the small and midcaps took the hardest hit.

The relentless selling pressure over the past two months has dragged the broader market into bear territory, with midcap and smallcap indices plunging nearly 20 percent from their record highs. The Nifty index managed to sustain above the 23,000 mark, reflecting resilience at this level. At the close, the Sensex declined by 122.52 points, or 0.16 percent, to settle at 76,171.08, while the Nifty slipped 26.55 points, or 0.12 percet, to end at 23,045.25.

Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking reflected on the negative market breadth, saying, "Nifty witnessed a sharp rally of 340 points after an initial decline of nearly 270 points, forming an indecisive Doji candlestick on the daily chart. This pattern signals a potential reversal in sentiment; however, further confirmation is required to determine the next directional move. If the index sustains above the 23,180 level, it could see further upside toward the 23,260–23,500 range. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 22,950 and 22,775, which could offer attractive buying opportunities for traders."

He further highlighted the top Nifty losers to be M&M, Bharat Electronics, Eicher Motors, ITC, and Hero MotoCorp. On the other hand, major gainers included SBI Life Insurance, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, and Tata Steel. In terms of the sectoral indices, all indices ended in the red except PSU Banks and Metals. Herein, the Realty index declining nearly 3 percent.
