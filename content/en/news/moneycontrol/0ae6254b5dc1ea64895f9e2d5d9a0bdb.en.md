BJP is voted back to power in Delhi after 27 years.
---------------------------------------------------

 

The BJP's landslide victory in the latest Delhi state elections is seen as a sentimental boost for equity markets, allaying fears over the stability of the NDA coalition, brokerages believe. "The Delhi state election results should be an incremental positive for the market as it allays any residual concerns over stability or smooth functioning of the coalition government at the center," Motilal Oswal Financial Services wrote in its note.

JM Financial echoed similar sentiments, stating that the decisive mandate in Delhi, along with recent comfortable victories in Haryana and Maharashtra, [helps ease concerns](https://www.moneycontrol.com/elections/assembly-election/delhi/delhi-results-why-a-win-in-the-national-capital-is-critical-for-bjp-and-pm-modi-article-12934600.html) that surfaced after the BJP’s lower-than-expected performance in the 2024 General Elections. As a result, the firm expects the win to have a positive sentimental impact on the markets and potentially act as a trigger to attract FII flows.

The [BJP secured a decisive victory in the Delhi Assembly elections](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/bjp-s-historic-win-in-delhi-will-be-remembered-more-for-aap-s-debacle-12934740.html), winning 48 out of 70 seats—well above expectations. While exit polls had predicted a BJP win, the actual tally surpassed estimates. With the win, the BJP secured power in the Delhi state government after a long wait of 27 years. Meanwhile, the ruling AAP saw a sharp decline, dropping to 22 seats from its previous 62-seat majority in the 2020 elections.

MOFSL believes BJP’s three consecutive victories in Haryana, Maharashtra, and Delhi will bolster confidence and drive stronger policy momentum for the NDA government, giving it flexibility to shape economic responses, as seen in the FY26 Union Budget.

With the budget now behind and the RBI providing monetary relief with its quarter-sized rate cut, the Delhi verdict will lift sentiment at the margin, MOFSL added.

However, the firm noted that market focus will now shift back to earnings, corporate guidance, and global macroeconomic factors, especially amid volatility triggered by US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

In such a backdrop, analysts at MOFSL suggest investors to maintain a large-cap heavy portfolio owing to its valuation differentials in comparison to small and mid-caps.
