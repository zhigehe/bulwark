The broader markets bore the brunt, with the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices nosediving nearly 3 percent each, sharply underperforming the benchmarks.

Sensex and Nifty stumbled in the second half of the trading session on February 14, as fears of relentless FII selling and weak Q3 earnings overshadowed any optimism sparked by easing Russia-Ukraine tensions, a delay in U.S. tariff impositions until April, positive U.S. producer data, and hopes of tariff discussions between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Investors remained cautious about the implications of reciprocal U.S. tariffs, despite Modi's offer to discuss easing tariffs, buying more U.S. oil and gas, combat aircraft, and concessions. This followed his meeting with Trump at the White House. Meanwhile, Trump is planning reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, fueling fears of a global trade war, although the imposition of these duties is likely to be delayed.

The broader markets bore the brunt, with the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices nosediving nearly 3 percent each, sharply underperforming the benchmarks.

At 1 PM, the Sensex was down 650 points or 0.9 percent at 75,489, and the Nifty was down 227 points or 1 percent at 22,781. About 514 shares advanced, 2,948 shares declined, and 77 shares were unchanged.

"The market sentiment is largely driven by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have been net sellers since last October," said Gaurang Shah, Senior Vice President at Geojit Financial Services.

In January 2025, FIIs offloaded Indian equities worth Rs 87,374 crore, and so far in February, they have sold shares worth Rs 24,888 crore. Shah expects this selling pressure to persist, noting, "However, the good part is that the selling pressure from FIIs is relatively lower than last year. We’ll have to wait and see when this stops."

Shah warned that if the Nifty breaks 22,800 and closes below that level, it could trigger further downside. On the broader market outlook, he pointed out that in small caps, valuations still appear overvalued despite the correction. "Secondly, earnings haven’t caught up with the current market valuations. In the mid-cap space, one needs to be very sector-specific in selecting investments."

The India VIX, a gauge of market volatility, surged 2 percent to 15.3, reflecting heightened fear among investors.

All 13 major sectoral indices were in the red, with Nifty Energy, Media, and Pharma taking the hardest hits, each falling 2-3 percent.

Among the Nifty 50, Bharat Electronics, Adani Enterprises, Shriram Finance, Adani Ports, and Sun Pharma were the biggest losers, tumbling 3-4 percent. Meanwhile, Nestle, Tata Consumer, ICICI Bank, HUL, and HCL Tech emerged as the top gainers, edging up 0.2-0.7 percent.
