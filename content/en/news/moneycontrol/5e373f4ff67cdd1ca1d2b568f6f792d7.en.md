The fall in real estate shares was accompanied by an widespread selloff, with Sensex down over 500 points at 75,603, and Nifty at 22,836, following a nearly 196-point cut, with all the sectoral indices in red.

The selloff comes after US President Trump's plan to pursue reciprocal tariffs with countries that run a trade deficit with US, and a persistent foreign outflow. Third quarter earnings too have added to the weakness in market sentiment.
