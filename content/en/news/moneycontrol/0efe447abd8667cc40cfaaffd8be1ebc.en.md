Sensex and Nifty lost steam around noon on February 14, slipping half a percent as financials, oil & gas, and pharma stocks weighed on sentiment. The broader markets took a bigger hit, with the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices plunging nearly 3 percent each, sharply underperforming the benchmarks.

The indices had kicked off the day with modest gains, riding on easing Russia-Ukraine tensions, a delay in U.S. tariff impositions until April, positive U.S. producer data, and reassurance that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump are open to discussions on lowering tariffs, easing concerns over reciprocal duties.

At 11:12 AM, the Sensex was down 419 points or 0.6 percent at 75,718, and the Nifty was down 141 points or 0.6 percent at 22,889. About 624 shares advanced, 2,706 shares declined, and 98 shares were unchanged.

"Early indications from the Modi-Trump talks are positive from the market perspective. The threatened reciprocal tariffs have been delayed leaving room for further negotiations and a possible deal," said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. "India’s willingness to buy more oil & gas from the US can help reduce the trade deficit with the US. Even though Trump is unlikely to back down on reciprocal tariffs, India is treated as a friendly country and the bonhomie between the two leaders augurs well for India."

Vijayakumar, however, struck a cautious note on the market's short-term outlook saying that a sustained rally in the market is unlikely since the FIIs continue to be in sell mode. "Only a decline in dollar and US bond yields will turn the FIIs into buyers." FIIs have offloaded Indian equities worth Rs 24,888 crore so far in February, reflecting a persistent risk-off sentiment.
