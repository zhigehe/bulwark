Looking ahead, the company remains cautious, anticipating flat profitability growth over the next year rather than a significant surge. Meanwhile, it plans to pass on the costs of transitioning to BS5 standards to customers, though consistent cost pressures may make price hikes challenging.

Festive season discounting weighed on margins, while rising commodity prices further impacted profitability by 0.5 percent in Q3, according to the management.

Domestic tractor sales saw a dip, falling to 6,058 units from 6,782 units in the same month last year. "Moving forward, with enhanced rabi sowing and as we approach harvesting season and the festive period, we expect an increase in demand momentum in our key markets," the company said. On a brighter note, export sales soared by 66 percent to 611 tractors in January 2025, compared to 368 in the previous year.

For the April-January period of FY25, domestic sales dropped slightly by 0.4 percent, reaching 91,820 units compared to 92,153 in FY24. Exports, however, plummeted by nearly 19 percent, falling to 3,770 units from 4,646. Overall sales dipped by 1.2 percent, settling at 95,590 units, down from 96,799.
