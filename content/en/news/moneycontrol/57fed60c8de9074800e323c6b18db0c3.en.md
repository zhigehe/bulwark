Nifty Trade Setup
-----------------

 

The Nifty 50 remained under pressure for the third consecutive session on February 7, losing 43 points amid volatility after the 25 bps rate cut by the RBI, which was in line with expectations. The continuation of lower tops-lower bottoms formation and the index falling below the 200-day EMA (23,620) made the short-term trend weak. Hence, if the index fails to defend the 23,500-23,400 support zone, selling pressure may extend with the negation of the higher highs-higher lows formation. However, holding above this level could take the index toward 23,800, the key resistance area, in the upcoming sessions, experts said.
