--------------------

 

Gujarat has rolled out a Global Capability Centre (GCC) Policy 2025-30 with an aim to attract about 250 new facilities, generate over 50,000 jobs and seek investment worth Rs 10,000 crore. The policy was unveiled by state Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel at GIFT City on February 11.

The development follows [Karnataka government’s GCC Policy unveiled last year](https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/karnatakas-gcc-policy-to-focus-on-employee-well-being-work-life-balance-and-beyond-bengaluru-clusters-article-12870728.html), targeting 500 new GCCs by 2029, which would create 3.5 lakh new jobs and generate an economic output of $50 billion. A GCC is an offshore unit set up by a company in a foreign country to in-source IT and other related business functions.

Karnataka was the first state in India to come up with a dedicated GCC policy to attract investment in the sector.

GCCs in the past couple of years have seen a historic rise in India, providing services in operation, product development and innovation. GCCs by multinational companies are set to contribute roughly [3.5 percent of India’s GDP by 2030](https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/by-2030-gccs-will-bring-121-bn-in-revenue-driving-3-5-of-indias-gdp-economic-survey-article-12774651.html), projected to generate an estimated revenue of $121 billion.

Gujarat's GCC policy offers several incentives to attract companies to set up captive units.

Companies setting up GCCs in Gujarat will receive capital expenditure support of up to Rs 200 crore, depending on the scale of investment. Additionally, operational expenditure assistance of up to Rs 40 crore is assured.

To encourage local hiring, the government will provide a one-time reimbursement covering 50 percent of one month’s Cost-to-Company (CTC) for newly recruited employees, capped at Rs 50,000 for men and Rs 60,000 for women.

Skill development initiatives will be backed by reimbursements of up to 75 percent for students and 50 percent for professionals as part of the policy.

The policy also includes a 7 percent interest subsidy on term loan, full reimbursement of electricity duty, and support for employer contributions to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), with up to 100 percent reimbursement for female employees and 75 percent for male employees.

Companies pursuing quality certifications will also be eligible for financial assistance, with the government covering up to 80 percent of certification costs, subject to a maximum of Rs 10 lakh.

The focus on GCCs was captured in the Union Budget 2025-26 as well, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing a [national framework to guide states in promoting GCCs](https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/finance-minister-sitharaman-announces-national-framework-to-accelerate-gcc-growth-in-tier-2-cities-article-12926610.html).

Through this framework, the aim is to provide structured guidance to states. Experts say cooperation between various stakeholders is essential to ensure the policy's long-term success.

On the launch of the policy, Tapan Ray, MD and Group CEO, GIFT City said that the smart city is emerging as a prime destination for GCCs.

"Our integrated ecosystem, coupled with strategic initiatives in fintech, Artificial Intelligence, and higher education, ensures that GCCs have the right resources to thrive, backed by progressive policies and seamless connectivity. GIFT City is poised to become a global hub for innovation, driving the next phase of India’s digital and financial transformation,” GIFT City's CEO said.
