Global index provider MSCI Inc. has announced changes to its indices as part of the February 2025 review, with adjustments set to take effect after market close on February 28.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd. has been added to the MSCI Global Standard Indexes, making it the only Indian large-cap stock included in this review, according to CNBC-TV18. The company, which went public in November last year, also saw the highest weight increase among Indian securities. Meanwhile, Adani Green Energy Ltd. has been removed from the index, according to NDTV Profit.

Among the top weight increases in the MSCI Standard Indexes, IndusInd Bank Ltd., Zomato Ltd., Varun Beverages Ltd., Mankind Pharma Ltd., Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Dixon Technologies (India) Ltd., PB Fintech Ltd., Adani Enterprises Ltd., and Voltas Ltd. joined Hyundai India in the top ten.

Conversely, the biggest weight decreases were seen in Adani Green Energy Ltd., Reliance Industries Ltd., HDFC Bank Ltd., Infosys Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd., Bharti Airtel Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., Larsen & Toubro Ltd., and Axis Bank Ltd.

Following this reshuffle, HDFC Bank holds the highest weightage among Indian stocks in MSCI indexes, followed by Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Bharti Airtel.

In the small-cap segment, MSCI added 19 Indian stocks and removed an equal number. The top ten additions included Jyoti CNC Automation Ltd., Ola Electric Mobility Ltd., CarTrade Tech Ltd., Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., TBO Tek Ltd., Websol Energy Systems Ltd., Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services Ltd., Shaily Engineering Ltd., Kovai Medical Center & Hospital Ltd., and Greaves Cotton Ltd.
