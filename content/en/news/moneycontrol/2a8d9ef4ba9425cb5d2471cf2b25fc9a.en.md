SEBI had set up ISFs to have a more collaborative regulatory approach.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The market regulator has released the Industry Standards Recognition Manual, to formalise the parameters for the recognition of industry standards and functioning of industry standard forums (ISFs).

ISFs had been launched on a pilot basis in July 2023 to help various segments of the market comply with SEBI's directions.

The manual was issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ([SEBI](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/tags/sebi.html)) on February 12.

The press statement from SEBI explained the reason behind issuing such a manual: "While the Industry Standards Fora are operating as pilot programmes, currently there are no norms in respect of their formation and functioning since each forum works with the flexibility of identifying mechanisms it finds most efficient in its functioning. This has led to different modes for constitution and functioning including with respect to the Regulations/ Circulars that should be taken up for formulation of implementation standards, stage at which SEBI is to be consulted, manner in which industry views are to be gathered, etc. "

Therefore the regulator has framed principles to recognise ISFs to ensure the streamlining of the constitution and processes followed by such ISFs.

According to the manual, ISFs are not meant to draft regulations or circulars, or suggest changes to existing regulations or circulars. But, in exceptional cases, where there are significant challenges to the implementation of a regulatory direction, the ISF may bring the same to the knowledge of SEBI suggesting changes, if any, to regulatory directions as required.

ISFs will be not self regulated and cannot take regulatory actions against any industry participant for failure to comply with standards set by the forum.

ISFs are to be chaired by a person with  at least 10 years of industry experience and they can appoint up to three vice-chairpersons. The members of the forum should be current practitioners, a representative of a market infrastructure institution (MII) as required, any person who needs to follow the regulatory directions and any adviser/consultant.
