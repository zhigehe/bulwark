Sensex and Nifty extended early losses on February 11, dropping 0.4 percent by noon as global uncertainties and weak domestic earnings weighed on sentiment. All 13 major sectoral indices were in the red, with financials and auto stocks dragging Nifty lower. The broader market bore the brunt, with the BSE Midcap falling over 2 percent and the BSE Smallcap tumbling nearly 3 percent.

At 11:32 AM, the Sensex was down 346 points or 0.5 percent at 76,965, while the Nifty slipped 126 points or 0.5 percent to 23,255. About 540 shares advanced, 2,871 shares declined, and 98 shares were unchanged. Today marked the fifth straight session of losses for the benchmarks.

US President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions on February 10 by reinstating and expanding tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The move revoked exemptions and duty-free quotas for key suppliers like Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, raising fears of a broader trade war.

The Indian rupee, already on a weakening trend, extended its decline to 87 against the dollar today, battered by Trump's latest tariff threats, which strengthened the greenback.

"Aggressive dollar buying from foreign banks and importers seeking to hedge against further currency weakness have further pressured the rupee," said Amit Pabari, MD of CR Forex  Advisors

"Yet on the domestic front, the Reserve Bank of India's decision to cut the repo rate added another layer of weakness. While the rate cut aims to stimulate economic growth, it also exerted downward pressure on the rupee. However, this move could support export growth, as evidenced by the decline in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) to 105, signalling improved export competitiveness."

Pabari expects the rupee to trade in an elevated range of 87.95-88.20 in the near term, with 87.20-87.40 acting as key support levels. "A close below 87.00 level is the first indication of a trend reversal," he said.

Foreign investors have pulled out Rs 12,643 crore from Indian equities this month, intensifying selling pressure.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed to a key trend in the ongoing market downturn, "The significant trend in the ongoing bearish phase of the market is the outperformance of largecaps over the broader market. While the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices are down 8.6 percent and 11.3 percent respectively YTD, the Nifty is down only 1.5 percent." He expects this outperformance to continue going forward.

He expects this outperformance to persist. "The relentless selling by FIIs in largecaps has made their valuations fair while the valuations of mid and smallcaps continue to be excessive. FIIs will certainly turn buyers in India; but that will happen only when the dollar index turns weak," he said. "When FIIs turn buyers in India, which is inevitable, they will be buying the largecaps which they are selling now. For patient investors, this is a good opportunity."

The Nifty Realty index was the worst hit, falling over 3 percent. [Phoenix Mills](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/constructioncontracting-real-estate/phoenixmills/PM02) and [Oberoi Realty](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/constructioncontracting-real-estate/oberoirealty/OR) plunged nearly 5 percent each.

[HDFC Bank](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/hdfcbank/HDF01) and [Kotak Mahindra](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/kotakmahindrabank/KMB) dragged the Nifty Bank index lower by nearly a percent, while [Eicher Motors](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-lcvshcvs/eichermotors/EM) weighed on the Nifty Auto index, which fell over a percent. Eicher tumbled nearly 6 percent after missing Q3FY25 profit and margin estimates, hurt by high costs and lower sales of premium motorcycles.

Among the biggest Nifty 50 losers, Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, Shriram Finance, SBI Life, and Power Grid fell between 2-6 percent. On the other hand, Adani Enterprises, Grasim, Infosys, Trent, and Bharti Airtel gained 1-3 percent.

Aakash Shah, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking, noted that Nifty has formed a bearish candlestick on the daily chart, signaling negative sentiment.

"The index faces key resistance at 23,460, and a breakout above this level could drive further gains towards 23,550 and 23,700. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 23,260, a crucial level for monthly trends. A breakdown below this mark could push the index lower towards 23,000, reinforcing a cautious outlook as Nifty struggles to maintain support at critical levels."
