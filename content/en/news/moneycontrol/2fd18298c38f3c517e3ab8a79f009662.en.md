------------------------

 

India's first, dedicated portal to track and analyse related-party transactions (RPTs), which was launched today on February 14, will give access to a widerange of stakeholders including investors, banks and credit rating agencies.

It will aim to track all the information related to RPTs, such as the shareholder voting patterns, for the previous two years. It should help investors and other entities take more informed decisions.

At the launch, which was held at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) Tower on Friday, SEBI's Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said that there is a lot of interest in the transparency around RPTs and that the portal is a step towards it.

To emphasise the importance that the regulator places on this, Buch said,"I would happy to throw entire LODR Regulations to bin barring those on RPT."

She said that there the most frequently asked question by institutional investors including foreign investors is the efforts taken to improve transparency around RPTs.

The idea of the portal, which was initiated and driven by the market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India ([SEBI](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/tags/sebi.html)), will be maintained by the three proxy advisories InGovern Research Services, Institutional Investor Advisory Services and Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES).

The entities will look to add more features in future such as which particular institutions voted for and which against an RPT transactions.
