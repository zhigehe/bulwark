The board of Mankind Pharma, India's fourth-largest drugmaker by domestic revenue, has approved the sale of its entire stake in subsidiary Mahananda Spa to Chalet Hotels at an Enterprise value of Rs 530 crore, a company filing said on February 10.

The amount raised will be used to part-pay debt, said Mankind Pharma. "The proceeds of monetization of non-core assets to be utilized to retire part of its debt."

The Share Purchase Agreement will be executed soon, said [Mankind Pharma](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pharmaceuticalsdrugs/mankindpharma/MP22), and the transaction will be completed by February 28, 2025. Mahananda Spa had a turnover of Rs 74.33 crore in FY24, and a networth of Rs 401.35 crore.

Hotel chain [Chalet Hotels](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/hotels/chalethotels/CH03) was founded in 1986 and is part of the K Raheja Group.

In October 2024, Mankind Pharma had [completed the acquisition of Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV)](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/companies-2/mankind-pharma-completes-rs-13768-cr-bharat-serums-acquisition-12849325.html) for a consideration of Rs 13,768 crore. This move positions Mankind as a market leader in the women's health and fertility drug market, and enabled access to high entry barrier products in critical care segment.

Mankind Pharma delivered a strong Q2FY25, with profit surpassing expectations, fueled by robust demand for its chronic illness medications targeting diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.

Shares of Mankind Pharma are lower by 13% so far this year, and up close to 13% over last one year. Macquarie had recently [downgraded Mankind's shares as Underperform](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mankind-pharma-shares-fall-4-as-macquarie-downgrades-to-underperform-12915433.html), stating that the domestic formulations business remains weak on account of slower growth in acute therapies, which makes up for two-third of the company’s revenue. The acquisition of Bharat Serum and Vaccine (BSV) negatively impacts bottom-line performance, said Macquarie.
