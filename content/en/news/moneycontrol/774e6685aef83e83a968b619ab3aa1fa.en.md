The situation in India is similar to a market structure where there are two extremes—on on each end. One is investors raising capital and on the other end there are many firms that can't secure investment from institutional players, he added.

The India lead for Canada's biggest pension plan - Ontario Teachers - believes the country offers great investing potential for Limited Partners (LPs), but there aren't enough investment opportunities available.

"LPs say that look, I love India, but I can't write big enough cheques for enough people," Deepak Dara, said senior managing director and head of India for Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, while speaking at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association Conclave in Mumbai on February 11.

A Limited Partner (LP) invests in a business with limited liability and does not participate in the day-to-day management.

Deepak Dara referred to the situation in India to a market structure with two extremes. At one end, investors are raising capital, and at the other end, many companies can't secure investment from institutional players, he said.

This, he said, could lead to India becoming a highly-concentrated market with a small number of investment managers - only six or seven - controlling 60-70 percent of the total investment capital, thus limiting the diversity of opportunities.

Limited Partners appreciate India’s optimism, said Deepak Dara, given that in global discussions there is a lot of talk about geopolitics, trade barriers and economic policies. In contrast, India’s outlook feels more stable and positive.
