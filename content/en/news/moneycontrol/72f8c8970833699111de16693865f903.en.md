Grasim Industries shares fell 0.5 percent during the trading session ahead of its Q3FY25 earnings.

At 11.27 am, [Grasim Industries](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/diversified/grasimindustries/GI01) shares were down 0.54 percent at Rs 2,474 on the National Stock Exchange.

As per Nuvama Institutional Equities, revenues for the company are expected to increase 23.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 7883 crore in Q3FY25. While adjusted PAT is expected to fall by 79 percent YoY to Rs 66 crore in the same period.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services added that overall EBITDA is estimated to decline by 11 percent YoY to Rs 459 crore in Q3FY25.

Nuvama Institutional Equities in its Q3FY25 earnings preview said that the losses from new business of paints and business-to-business shall hamper overall margins of the company.

Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) volume is estimated to grow around 7 percent YoY while chemical segment volume is likely to increase by 2 percent, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The paints segment which is expected to bring down the revenues for the company in Q3 was in a goos state last quarter. Grasim Industries' management in Q2FY25 had said that the feedback on product quality from dealers and contractors across all the product segments launched is extremely positive as the quality of the product is better than what is available in the market.

"Furthermore, the aim to have 50,000 dealers on board by end of FY25. Similarly, the target to reach 150 depots by FY25 is on track and has currently reached 114 depots. Out of the range of 145 planned products, 129 have been placed in the distribution channel," the management had said in its Q2FY25 earnings conference call.

On the B2B side, the company had said that Birla Pivot—the full-scale B2B e-commerce platform for building materials— continues to grow in-line with its plan and remains on track to achieve revenue of $1billion in three years as announced in FY24.

Plus these business has expanded its product offerings across 35 product categories comprising 40,000-plus and continues to expand its geographical reach with delivery to 375 cities across 26 states and union territories, the management had said.

**Cement industry**  
An earnings downgrade for FY25E/26E is likely on the cards due to a weak pricing environment amid aggressive capacity expansion in the cement industry, said Nuvama Institutional Equities. "We anticipate further consolidation in the space, mostly in the southern region due to its fragmented nature," the report added. Plus, softening fuel prices along with cost efficiency measures undertaken by various players are likely to provide some relief on the cost front thereby cushioning the impact of weak realisations to some extent, it added.
