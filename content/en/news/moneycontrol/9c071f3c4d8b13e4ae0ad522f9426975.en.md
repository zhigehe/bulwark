Benchmark indices extended fall for a fifth consecutive session on February 11, with [Nifty 50](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/cnx-nifty-9.html) slipping below the 23,000 level during the session, weighed down by all-round selling and concerns over US President Trump’s fresh tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.

Bears took the charge after a weak start, and further pulled down the markets, with an across-the-board selloff taking Nifty 50 below 23,000 for the first time since January 28, 2025.

Broader indices underperformance continued, with Nifty Midcap index down 3 percent, and Smallcap index falling by as much as 3.5 percent.

The biggest losers on Nifty 50 were Apollo Hospitals, Eicher Motors, Shriram Finance, Coal India, Bharat Electronics, while gainers included Adani Enterprises, Trent, Bharti Airtel, Grasim Industries.

All the sectoral indices ended in the red, with auto, consumer durables, oil & gas, energy, FMCG, media, PSU Bank and realty falling between 2-3 percent.

"The downside momentum continued in the market for the fifth consecutive sessions on Tuesday and Nifty closed the day with steep decline of 309 points. After opening with a negative note, the market continued to decline further for better part of the session. Sharp intraday weakness triggered in the midpart of the session and Nifty finally closed near the lows," said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

"A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart that has decisively broken the crucial support of 23400 levels and closed lower. Technically this pattern indicates prevalence of strong downside momentum in the market. The bullish chart pattern formed after the recent upside bounce has been negated and the sentiment has been changed to sharply negative."

"The larger degree bearish pattern like lower tops and bottoms is visible on the daily chart and the Nifty is now sliding down to form a new lower bottom below the swing low of January at 22786 levels. However, any upside bounce from here could find strong resistance around 23200 levels," he added.

The [Bank Nifty](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/bank-nifty-23.html) index too remained under pressure for the third session, ending 1.16 percent lower at 49,403.40.
