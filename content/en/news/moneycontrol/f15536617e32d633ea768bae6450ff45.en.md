The RBI has stuck to its tested policy of forex intervention even under a new governor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

**Highlights**

* *US President Trump’s tariff hikes have hit markets across the globe and currencies too*
* *The Indian rupee tumbled to a record low on Monday to be the worst performing Asian currency*
* *But within a day, the rupee has staged the strongest comeback in two years, thanks to RBI intervention*
* *The earlier market perception that the RBI under the new governor would let the rupee depreciate seems to be wrong*

When regulators trigger a perception of softening, markets always test this perception
