Nifty Trade Setup
-----------------

 
  

The benchmark Nifty 50 showed a smart recovery from the day's low (almost similar to January's low), although it sustained a downward journey for six consecutive days, ending the session 27 points lower on February 12. The overall trend remains in favour of the bears, but the chart formation signals the possibility of a rebound soon, according to experts. Therefore, if it sustains 23,000 on a closing basis in the upcoming sessions, the immediate hurdle on the higher side will be 23,200-23,300. However, falling below this level could open the door for Wednesday's low of 22,800.

The index traded below all key moving averages and dropped below the previous swing low, indicating an overall negative trend.
