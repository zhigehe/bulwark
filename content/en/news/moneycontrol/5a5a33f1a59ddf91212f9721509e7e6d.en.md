Shares of [Maruti Suzuki India Limited](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-carsjeeps/marutisuzukiindia/MS24) shares gained one percent to Rs 12,780 in early deals on February 14, extending gains for a second session in a row, after international brokerage HSBC maintained its 'buy' call and raised the target price to Rs 14,000 citing robust prospects for its maiden EV scheduled to hit the road this year.

With a target price of Rs 14,000, analysts at the firm forecast an upside potential of 10.4 percent from the last closing price of Rs 12,671 on the National Stock Exchange. Before this two-day rally, Maruti Suzuki stock had fallen for seven consecutive sessions.

HSBC says that India’s potential as an export hub for EVs is massive and Maruti Suzuki could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The brokerage sees monthly EV exports of 5,000–6,000 units as a plausible estimate for Maruti Suzuki's maiden E-Vitara. While percentage margins on exports could be lower, absolute margins are expected to hold steady. HSBC believes that traction in EV exports will be a key driver for the Maruti Suzuki stock.

Suzuki Motor Corporation, which holds a 58 percent stake in Maruti Suzuki India, is betting big on India as a global production hub for its latest electric model. The company plans to export the model to over 100 countries, including Japan and Europe, reinforcing India’s role as a key player in EV manufacturing.

However, executives acknowledge that profitability in the EV segment remains a long-term challenge. During the post-Q3 earnings call, management admitted that EV margins would lag behind those of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for the foreseeable future, with government subsidies playing a crucial role in sustaining the transition.

The Maruti Suzuki e-Vitara will enter a competitive space, taking on the likes of the Mahindra BE 6, Tata Curvv EV, MG Windsor EV, and the upcoming Hyundai Creta EV, launched in January 2025.

India's largest four-wheeler manufacturer reported a 16 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 3,727 crore for the third quarter of FY25, surpassing analysts' estimates. Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 38,764 crore, marking a 16 percent year-on-year rise, slightly below analysts' estimate of Rs 38,838 crore.

At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 12,765, higher by 0.8 percent from the last close on the NSE. Despite the recent fall, Maruti Suzuki has rallied nearly 17 percent since the start of the year.
