---------------------------------------

 

Accenture Chief Executive Officer Julie Sweet has been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and the treatment is likely to last 12-16 weeks, *Moneycontrol* has learnt.

“I was very recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The good news is that the prognosis from my doctor is excellent; the cancer was caught early, and my condition is curable,” an internal mail by Sweet to employees, seen by *Moneycontrol*, read.

She added that scans confirmed that there was no evidence of cancer elsewhere in the body.

"As stated in the memo Julie sent to our people, her prognosis is excellent, the cancer was caught early, and her condition is curable. She will work substantially as normal, and continue to lead the day-to-day operation of the company," an Accenture spokesperson told *Moneycontrol*.

Sweet will undergo surgery next week, and the expected treatment afterward is radiation.

Nonetheless, the CEO of the world’s largest IT company will lead its day-to-day operations throughout the process.

However, she will curtail travel during this period. Accenture’s Board has been briefed and is fully supportive of the developments.

“We have an incredible Global Management Committee, supported by our amazing teams around the world. I am confident that we will continue to do what we do best- deliver 360° value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners, and communities,” the mail read further.
