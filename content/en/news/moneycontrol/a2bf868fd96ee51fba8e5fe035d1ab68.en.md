**Market Performance**

Benchmark indices showed [resilience for a 2nd consecutive day](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-bounce-back-after-six-day-slide-financials-pharma-lead-recovery-12939548.html), with Nifty 50 gaining 190 points (+0.8%) intraday, however, selling pressure in the second half of the day erased most of the gains. By the end of the session, [Nifty 50](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/cnx-nifty-9.html) closed above the crucial 23,000 mark with a marginal loss.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said, "Market experienced volatility on the back of mixed global cues and curiosity ahead of the highly-anticipated meeting between Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump later today."

The market is anticipating a fruitful meeting even as President Trump has increased the pressure on [imposing reciprocal tariffs](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/today-is-the-big-one-reciprocal-tariffs-says-donald-trump-12940034.html).

"Nifty Pharma and Healthcare indices witnessed buying interest, gaining over a percent each after reports suggested US might consider exempting pharma sector from reciprocal tariffs," said Siddhartha Khemka.

Equities will track the outcome of the Modi-Trump meeting, and the last set of Q3FY25 earnings, slated tomorrow.
