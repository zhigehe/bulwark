CLSA is 20% overweight on India, reverses tactical allocation shift to China amid Trump tariff concerns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Global brokerage firm CLSA on February 13 said it has reverse its earlier tactical allocation shift from India to China as "Trump 2.0 heralds a trade war escalation".

In a note titled "Pouncing Tiger, prevaricating Dragon", CLSA laid out its Asia Pacific market strategy and said "misfortune can happens in threes" for China, which has played out for Chinese equities over the past week.

"Trump 2.0 heralds a trade war escalation just as exports become the largest contributor to China's growth. The NPC stimulus amounts to de-risking with little reflationary benefit. Finally, higher US yields and inflation expectations sap scope for the Fed and thus, PBOC to ease. We are anxious that these concerns lead to a buyers' strike by offshore investors who built China exposure post the initial PBOC stimulus in September. We therefore reverse our tactical allocation in early October, returning to a benchmark on China and a 20% overweight on India," said CLSA.

Policymakers still face a unenviable blend of deflation, falling property prices, rising youth unemployment, poor household confidence, stagnant real estate investment and growth in real retail sales at half the pre-pandemic rate, said CLSA about the potential problems plaguing China.

"We are concerned that investors have lost patience and are assuming policymakers will lowball further stimulus, and thus may use the advent of those two occasions as an opportunity to reduce exposure," said the brokerage.

CLSA added that India benefits from an appreciable moat should trade hostilities heat up again.

"India appears as among the least exposed of regional markets to Trump's adverse trade policy. Moreover, so long as energy prices remain stable, India may offer a relative oasis of FX stability in an era of a strengthening US dollar. Paradoxically, India has seen strong net foreign investor selling since October, while investors we met this year have been waiting specifically for such a buying opportunity to address Indian underexposure," said CLSA.

Domestic appetite remains strong, offsetting foreign jitters, and valuation, though pricey, is now a little more palatable, it added.

"From the outset we were sceptical on the endurance of the China equity melt up. Our initial reaction was to rent rather than buy the rally, yet we committed funds at the start of October by tactically deploying some of our over exposure on India to China. We now reverse that trade. Both MSCI China and India have corrected by 10% in US dollar terms over the duration so we did not lose on making the switch. The chief risk to Indian equities is a frenzy of issuance swamping the market," CLSA said about its rationale for being overweight on India.
