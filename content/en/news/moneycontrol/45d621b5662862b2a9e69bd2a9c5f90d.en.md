The trade union representing workers of Hindusthan National Glass, which filed for insolvency in 2021, has written to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging that the competition regulator’s action in the matter related to the acquisition of the company undermined a Supreme Court judgement in a related case.

“We, HNG Industries Thozhilalar Nala Sangam (CITU), a registered trade union representing the workers of Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Limited (HNGIL), write to you with serious concern and profound disappointment regarding the actions of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which appear to directly undermine the recent judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of India,” stated the letter.

“As you are well aware, the Hon'ble Supreme Court adjudicated multiple consolidated appeals, with the principal appeal being… filed by Independent Sugar Corporation Ltd., along with our own appeal as a trade union. These proceedings culminated in a final and binding judgment. Notably, the Competition Commission of India was also an appellant and respondent in the connected appeals and its conduct throughout the process has been highly questionable,” it added.

The roots of the matter go back to October 2021 when Hindusthan National Glass filed for insolvency and two bidders -- AGI Greenpac and Independent Sugar Corp (INSCO) – emerged vying for the company.

Last month, the apex court delivered a judgement, quashing AGI Greenpac’s resolution plan for failing to obtain prior approval from the CCI, as mandated under Section 31(4) of the IBC Act and Section 29 of the Competition Act, 2002.

The Supreme Court set aside the NCLAT judgment that upheld AGI Greenpac’s resolution plan approval. More importantly, it sent the matter back to CCI for reconsideration while ensuring proper compliance with both the IBC and the Competition Act.

The Supreme Court directed that CCI must follow proper procedure under Section 29 of the Competition Act, including issuing a Show Cause Notice and inviting public objections.

“The CCI granted approval based on factually incorrect and misleading data, provided by AGI Greenpac,” stated the SC order.

Meanwhile, the letter by the trade union has highlighted the fact that the SC verdict is a “binding legal directive that must be upheld”.

“Any attempt by the Competition Commission of India to review or challenge the verdict in any form will be seen as a direct attack on the rule of law and an abuse of power,” it added.

Further, the trade union has demanded that the CCI should immediately “cease and desist” from challenging or reviewing the SC order and provide “full transparency regarding its past actions in this case and justify its decisions, which have clearly been made under undue influence.”
