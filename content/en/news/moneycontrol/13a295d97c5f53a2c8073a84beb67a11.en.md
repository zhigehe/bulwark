Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch
----------------------------------

 

The Industry Standards Forum, a collaborative platform set up by capital market regulator Sebi, has approved the minimum required disclosures for listed companies before they seek shareholder nod for a Related-Party Transaction (RPT), Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said on February 14 at an event in Mumbai.

The ISF has agreed on the minimum required disclosures for listed companies, before a RPT is taken up for approval by the Audit Committee as well as the shareholders.

"Governance is what drives trust in companies. Why emphasis on RPTs? It is our belief that in every decision made by its company, in almost every case, the objectives and interests of promoters and minority shareholders are aligned. The only place where there is a potential for divergence is RPTs," SEBI's Madhabi Puri said, stressing on the need for transparancy around RPTs.

Chairperson Madhabi Puri also [launched a portal](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/proxy-advisors-sebi-launch-portal-to-track-related-party-transactions-12940856.html) for tracking and analysing related-party transactions, which is the first and one-of-a-kind dedicated website.
