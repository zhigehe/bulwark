The brokerage expects credit costs to decline significantly over the next two quarters, supported by factors such as falling interest rates, improved liquidity, and potential tax cuts. It also notes that the RBI's softer stance on unsecured loans could act as an additional catalyst. However, Macquarie has trimmed its earnings estimates for FY25-27 by 13-15 percent, factoring in slower loan growth, net interest income, and fees. Despite this, a reduction in sustainable credit costs has increased sustainable return on assets (ROA) by 30 basis points to 4.5 percent.

During the third quarter, the company reported a 30 percent year-on-year decline in its consolidated net profit which stood at Rs 383.2 crore, down from Rs 549.1 crore reported in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.

Consolidated revenue from operations inched up 1 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,767 crore, compared to Rs 4,742 crore in the same period last year. However, net interest income (NII) dipped 3.5 percent to Rs 3,790.1 crore from Rs 3,926.2 crore.

Asset quality showed slight improvement, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) easing to 3.24 percent from 3.27 percent in the preceding quarter. Net NPAs remained largely stable, ticking down to 1.18 percent from 1.19 percent. Meanwhile, the provision coverage ratio saw a marginal decline, settling at 64.3 percent versus 64.4 percent sequentially.

At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 834, higher by 2.2 percent from the last close on the NSE. SBI Cards & Payment Services' share price has gained 23 percent since the start of the year.
