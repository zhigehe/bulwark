World Street
------------

 

Meta plans to cut jobs based on performance while hiring new employees, Mixue Group is preparing for a $500 million Hong Kong IPO, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman dismissed Elon Musk’s $97.4 billion acquisition bid. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against presidential interference. All this and more on the February 12 edition of World Street.

**Meta to accelerate layoffs**

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that upcoming job cuts at the company will be performance-based. However, Meta also intends to bring in new hires this year to replace those being let go. Just last month, the company issued a firm warning about its plan to eliminate around 3,600 positions. In an internal memo, Zuckerberg explained, “I’ve decided to set a higher standard for performance management and phase out underperformers more quickly.”

**Bubble tea to bourses**

China’s leading bubble tea chain, Mixue Group, is gearing up for its Hong Kong IPO, with bookbuilding expected to start by late February. Three sources familiar with the matter said the company aims to raise approximately $500 million. One of them added that Mixue is targeting an early March listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. According to regulatory filings, the company operates 40,000 stores across China.

**OpenAI rejects acquisition offer**

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman turned down an unexpected acquisition proposal from a group of investors led by Elon Musk, who offered $97.4 billion to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit arm. Altman responded on X, formerly known as Twitter, which Musk acquired for $44 billion in 2022, by saying, "no thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."

**Trump can't fire Fed Chair**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed that a U.S. president does not have the authority to dismiss Federal Reserve Board members. During Senate Banking Committee testimony, Powell dismissed speculation that then-President Donald Trump could legally remove board members. Throughout his time in office, Trump repeatedly criticized Powell’s leadership, expressing frustration over his interest rate decisions—whether he raised them, lowered them, or left them unchanged. Trump initially appointed Powell in 2018 but quickly grew dissatisfied with his choices.

**$5 billion IPO?**

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world’s largest EV battery maker, has officially filed for a major stock offering in Hong Kong, potentially the biggest in the city in four years. The long-awaited IPO application comes as Hong Kong’s stock market experiences a rally. According to Bloomberg News, CATL could raise over $5 billion, making it the largest listing since Kuaishou Technology’s $6.2 billion debut in early 2021.

**Ford slams Trump tariffs**

Ford CEO Jim Farley voiced concerns about tariffs imposed and proposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they have brought “a lot of costs and a lot of chaos.” However, he acknowledged that Trump’s broader goal is to bolster the American auto industry. Ford is now assessing its inventory strategy to brace for potential 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. While the tariffs were initially set to take effect this month, Trump postponed them until March, executives noted during a Tuesday analyst conference.
