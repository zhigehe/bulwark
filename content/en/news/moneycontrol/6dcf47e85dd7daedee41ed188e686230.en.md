India’s equity benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty 50 opened lower on February 10, as global trade tensions cast a shadow over risk appetite. This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump fired another salvo to shake up global trade, announcing fresh reciprocal tariffs that could upend market dynamics.

At 9:20 AM, the Sensex was down 311 points or 0.4 percent at 77,548, and the Nifty was down 97 points or 0.4 percent at 23,462. About 1,168 shares advanced, 1,607 shares declined, and 149 shares were unchanged.

Market sentiment remains largely negative, weighed down by FII outflows, tariff tensions, and weak Q3 earnings. "There has not been any such sort of news or announcements which can change the direction of the market. Trump issue-all his announcements and the volatility, is going to continue," said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst.

On February 7, Trump vowed to slap tariffs on multiple countries as early as February 11 or 12, intensifying his push to level the playing field in America's favour. Taking things a step further, he revealed plans for a steep 25 percent tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, a move that could have far-reaching consequences for global trade flows.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly preparing tariff concessions to sweeten the deal ahead of his meeting with Trump, aiming to defuse tensions and prevent a full-blown trade war.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have dumped Rs 10,179 crore worth of Indian equities so far in February, as higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar erode the appeal of emerging markets.

The rupee, fresh off its worst weekly decline since December 2022, is under renewed pressure, with trade tariff risks adding to investor anxiety ahead of crucial U.S. inflation data this week.

"It's a natural reaction. When the rupee is weak, dollar-denominated returns don’t look attractive to foreign investors and hence FIIs are likely to continue pulling out funds," said Baliga. "Earnings haven’t been strong enough to provide any meaningful support to the market either," he added.

Among sectoral indices, financials, oil & gas, and metals weighed on the Nifty, while auto, telecom, and FMCG provided support.

The metals index dropped 2 percent after Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on U.S. steel and aluminium imports, along with reciprocal tariffs matching each country's levy. SAIL, Tata Steel, and Vedanta led the metal index slump, dropping 4 percent each.

Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Cipla, Power Grid, and Hindalco led the declines on the Nifty 50, slipping 1-2 percent, while Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, M&M, BEL, and Britannia topped the gainers' list, climbing 1-2 percent.

The Sensex and Nifty ended lower in the previous session after the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee lowered the repo rate by 25-basis-point rate cut—the first in nearly five years—to 6.25 percent.

Baliga noted that the RBI’s recent rate move was largely expected, preventing a sharper market reaction. "Had the RBI not made this move, the market reaction would have been more negative. However, since it matched expectations, the impact is largely neutral."

U.S. markets slumped on February 7, with all three major indexes closing lower after Trump’s tariff threats sent shockwaves through global markets. Weak jobs data and fading consumer sentiment further compounded investor worries. Asian markets mirrored the jitters, trading mixed today as Wall Street futures pointed lower.

Markets will now closely watch CPI inflation data from both India and the U.S., set for release on February 12.
