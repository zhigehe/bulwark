Brokerages issued mixed calls on Pizza Hut operator Devyani International after the quick-service restaurant (QSR) player reported a net loss in the quarter ended December, 2024.

[Devyani International](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/consumer-food/devyaniinternational/DI06) reported a consolidated loss of Rs 49.2 lakh for the quarter that ended December 2024, a sharp reversal from a Rs 9.6 crore profit in the same period last year.

This decline came despite a 53 percent surge in revenue from operations to Rs 1,294 crore. A key factor was a Rs 2.9 crore foreign exchange loss, contrasting with a Rs 3 crore forex gain in the year-ago quarter.

The company's management remains bullish on KFC and will continue with stores as well brand investments in this format. The company added 44 stores this quarter, taking the YTD run rate to 93 stores, which implies it is on track to meet its annual guidance of 100 store additions.

Devyani International has seen good response on the KFC side to promotions but not the same case for Pizza Hut, therefore the firm is recalibrating the marketing spends from January onwards.

Nuvama Institutional Equities kept its 'buy' rating intact, while bumping its target price up to Rs 214, from Rs 208 per share earlier.

On the flip side, Emkay Global said, "To meet the agreement requirements, store additions inched up across formats, but the Pizza Hut expansion is slated to be cautious, with pace of expansion being retained for KFC/other formats hereon. While a growth turnaround is built into our estimates, we await initial recovery trends before turning constructive."

The brokerage reiterated its 'reduce' call, with a target price of Rs 170 apiece, which indicates flat returns.
