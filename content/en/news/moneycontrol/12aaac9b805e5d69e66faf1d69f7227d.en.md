Sensex and Nifty snapped a six-day losing streak and saw a rally on February 13 after India's better-than-expected inflation data raised hopes of a rate cut by the RBI. The benchmarks had been on a losing streak, closing in the red for six straight sessions amid disappointing Q3 earnings, escalating U.S. tariff tensions, and persistent FII outflows.

At 1 PM, the Sensex was up 448 points or 0.6 percent at 76,619, and the Nifty was up 140 points or 0.6 percent at 23,185. About 2,218 shares advanced, 1,214 shares declined, and 103 shares were unchanged.

When asked if the rally is sustainable or if there are lingering concerns, Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research at Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers, said, "It’s too early to tell, but the lower-than-expected inflation raised hopes of a continuing decline in inflation and it potentially stabilizing at a level comfortable for the RBI, which is positive for domestic markets."

India's retail inflation cooled to a five-month low of 4.3 percent in January, down from 5.2 percent in December, largely due to easing food prices. This bolstered hopes of further monetary easing from the Reserve Bank of India. However, a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation print tempered those expectations.

"Additionally, PM Modi’s visit to the U.S. has sparked optimism for potential trade-related announcements, which could reduce volatility and be positive for both countries. These factors combined indicate a positive outlook for the markets in the coming days, with recovery potentially on the cards," Solanki added.

Trade war fears continued to loom after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on U.S. imports, raising the stakes ahead of his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington today.

Meanwhile, Anita Gandhi, Whole Time Director at Arihant Capital Markets, said that it’s a wait-and-watch situation now, especially with FII outflows. "The Indian market corrected ahead of the US, starting in October. Inflation being under control is a relief, but FII selling continued until yesterday."

Regarding the sectoral outlook, Solanki mentioned that domestic-oriented sectors like consumer, retail, durables, auto, and rate-sensitive stocks are expected to see a better revival in the short term.

Gandhi cautioned, "The U.S. inflation data was not as strong, which could delay rate cuts there, impacting IT budgets and sentiment towards Indian IT stocks. So, it’s a mixed bag."
