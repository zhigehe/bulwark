[Delhi-headquartered Eicher Motors Limited](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-lcvshcvs/eichermotors/EM)is set to release its earnings report for the third fiscal quarter of FY25 on February 10. Analysts expect strong revenue growth driven by sharp volumes and export business uptick. Margins could face pressure due to high marketing efforts.

According to a *Moneycontrol*poll of eight brokerage firms, the Royal Enfield maker is anticipated to record a 2.17 percent year-on-year increase in revenue to Rs 10,099 crore. Net profit is projected to rise 28.6 percent to Rs 1,176 crore from Rs 914 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Earnings estimates from analysts polled by *Moneycontrol*are in a narrow range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price.

**What factors are driving Eicher Motor's earnings?**

Analysts suggest revenue growth and net profit could witness a sharp uptick while margins could contract amid higher marketing spend.

**EBITDA Contraction:** EBITDA margins are expected to decline marginally year-on-year, primarily weighed down by higher marketing spend. As per average estimates, the EBITDA margin is expected to contract 40 basis points to 25.7 percent from 26.1 percent reported in the same period last year.

**Strong Volume Growth:** The company has sold 2,72,297 units in the third quarter, reflecting a massive 19.4 percent increase from 2,28,073 units sold in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Furthermore, Axis Securities said in a note that exports could witness a 100 percent on-year growth.

**Robust Revenue:** Strong growth in the domestic market, along with a sequential pickup in both domestic and export segments, is expected to drive standalone revenue. Additionally, higher average selling prices (ASPs), supported by price hikes over the past year, are expected to further boost revenue.
