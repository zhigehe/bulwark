Nifty Trade setup
-----------------

 
  

Bears gained more strength on February 11, taking the benchmark Nifty 50 decisively below midline of Bollinger Bands as well as below the low of February 3. The index plunged 1.3 percent on US tariff concerns, negating higher highs-higher lows formation, signalling weakness ahead. Therefore, if the index decisively breaks 23,000, which defended on closing basis, the fall may be extended to 22,800 (near the low of January), but in case of rebound, 23,300 is likely to be hurdle on the higher side, experts said.
