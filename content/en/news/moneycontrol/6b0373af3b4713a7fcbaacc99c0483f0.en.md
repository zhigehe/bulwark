After a strong bull run, Indian markets are showing signs of reversal, making this the ideal time to focus on companies with pricing power plays, as per Ambit Asset Management.

Pricing power refers to the company’s ability to raise prices and maintain margins ensuring a period of increased costs or competition. Pricing power firms have not only outperformed the market during inflationary periods but have also delivered steady gains over the long run globally, said Ambit in its latest note to its investors.

The fund house is of the view that this is the ideal time to focus on gross profit margin (GPM) as a key indicator for bottom-up stock selection since it is the best metric to identify companies with pricing power plays.

A healthy GPM that meets or exceeds industry benchmark is a leading indicator of superior market returns and scalability of a business, it says.

Ambit has analysed the 50 most stable or least volatile stocks in India with a market capitalisation above Rs 10,000 crore. Further, the analysis used five years of data while excluding unprofitable and lending financial companies.

While the study was conducted for three different fiscals -- FY23, FY24, and FY25 -- the results were further categorised based on sector, market capitalisation, return on equity (ROE), and total returns to give a clearer picture of which types of companies tend to be the most stable.

Post the exhaustive analysis, the asset management firm short-listed the top Indian 'pricing power' companies -- Hindustan Zinc, Torrent Pharma, Coal India, Adani Ports, Mankind Pharma, DMart, RVNL, Abbott India, Colgate, AIA Engineering, Page Industries, Indus Towers, JBM Auto, J.B. Chemicals, Caplin Point, Suven Pharma, Carborundum Universal, and Navin Fluorine.

Meanwhile, the fund management firm added that pricing power companies are often less glamorous and newsworthy, except in their early growth stages. However, they are quiet, stable, and high-quality compounders that generate consistent long-term returns, it said.

It added that pricing power has not only outperformed the market during inflationary periods but has also delivered steady gains over the long run globally.

Also, companies with pricing power maintain stable profit margins by passing cost increases to consumers and scaling production with demand. By raising prices to offset inflation, they protect real earnings and shield investors from rising costs, it said.

However, the ‘pricing power’ strategy also has some limitations. It says that while selecting the 50 most stable companies based on GPM, some strong-performing companies were left out.

“This happens because the methodology removes companies with higher standard deviation in GPM, even if their margins are steadily increasing due to better products, stronger competition, or business improvements,” it said.

While it makes sense to exclude companies with temporary ups and downs, this approach also unintentionally eliminates some genuinely improving companies, it adds. The excluded companies from the list have actually delivered much higher returns of 493 percent compared to Nifty 500’s 115 percent over five years.

Also, the method fails to capture new-age companies, struggling companies making a strong comeback, and seasonal companies with high-quality businesses like airlines.
