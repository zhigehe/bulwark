**Market View**

At the close, the Sensex dropped 1.3 percent, shedding 1,018 points to settle at 76,293.60, while the Nifty declined 1.32 percent, losing 309.8 points to end at 23,071.80.

All the sectoral indices ended in the red.

On today's markets, Mahesh Patil, CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, said, "As we navigate the current market volatility, investors should focus on a diversified strategy that balances risk and reward. The global backdrop remains uncertain, but India’s long-term fundamentals continue to be strong, with fiscal and monetary policies likely to ease in 2025." He added that despite near-term challenges, such as a slowdown in GDP growth and earnings moderation, the outlook is improving as key risks are priced in.

Additionally, market corrections, particularly in mid and small-cap stocks, present an opportunity for long-term investors to deploy capital gradually.
