Stock broker Fyers has been fined Rs 4 lakh for various violations including not adequately monitoring peak loads and not installing capacity to meet the required 1.5x threshold of the peak load.

In the order issued on February 13, the Securities and Exchange Board of India ([SEBI](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/tags/sebi.html)) stated that the broker had also failed to prove that its governing board conducted the mandated quarterly reviews of Business Continuity Plan-Disaster Recovery (BCP-DR) Policy during the period under investigation, and failed to submit documentary evidence for constitution of Incident and Response Team (IRT) and Crisis Management Team (CMT).
