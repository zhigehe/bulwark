This event promises to give deep insights into emerging market trends and more!

Over the past few years, we have witnessed a capex-heavy economy, where capital expenditure-driven policies fueled an average annualized growth of 30 percent between FY22 and FY24. This period saw substantial investments in railways, shipbuilding, defense, and other key sectors.

As a result, growth stocks—particularly in the PSU space—experienced a remarkable rally. Companies like Mazagon Dock, Hindustan Aeronautics, REC, and Titagarh Rail Systems surged, driven by the rising capex cycle. However, the capex-led growth story now appears to be largely played out, with the government's focus shifting toward boosting consumption.

The recent budget reflects this shift, offering tax relief to individuals with a NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh per annum. The move comes in response to a slowing GDP growth rate and weakening corporate earnings over the past two quarters.

To add to this, we are seeing Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) moving out from Indian markets because of an attractive US market. Since January this year, FIIs have sold Indian equities worth around Rs 91,000 crore.

This evolving landscape raises a pressing question: where will the next wave of market leaders emerge?

To address this, PMS AIF WORLD, in collaboration with *Moneycontrol*, presents the Crystal Gazing Investment Summit & Awards 2025, themed “Decoding the Next Bull Run.” Scheduled for February 14–15, 2025, this virtual event promises to provide deep insights into emerging market trends and help investors position themselves for the next structural bull market.
