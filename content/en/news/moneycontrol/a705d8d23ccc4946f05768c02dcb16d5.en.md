A fresh tariff scare by US President Donald Trump roiled Indian equities, with the benchmark indices ending lower for a fourth day on February 10, dragging Nifty 50 near 23,300. President Trump had earlier said that he would impose additional tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.

The [Nifty 50](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/cnx-nifty-9.html) index extended the selloff after a weak start, but recovery in banking names helped erase some intraday losses. At close, Nifty 50 ended at 23,381.60, down 0.76 percent or 178.35 points. Chartists said today's fall could potentially send Nifty 50 towards the next support of 23,240.

Broader indices underperformed the benchmarks, with Nifty Midcap and Smallcap lower by 2 percent each.

Trent, Power Grid Corp, Tata Steel, Titan Company, ONGC were among the top losers on the Nifty, while gainers were Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia Industries, Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies, Tata Consumer Products.

"With a strong bearish candlestick, the index has decisively broken through its key support level of 23,500, signaling a potential move towards the next support level of 23,240. Meanwhile, the resistance level has shifted lower to 23,465," Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares said.

All the sectoral indices ended in the red, with metal, media, pharma, consumer durables, energy, realty down 2-3 percent.

"The ongoing tariff-related trade war build up continued to negatively impact the Indian equities. Following a sluggish opening, the index extended losses through the day, and ultimately closed at 23,381.60 with a considerable fall of 178.35 points. All sectors experienced substantial declines, with Realty and Metal tumbling the most. The selling pressure was particularly intense in the broader markets, as both mid and small-cap segments saw declines of 2.12% and 2.11%, respectively," Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares said.

The [Bank Nifty](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/bank-nifty-23.html) index too witnessed extended selling during the day, and ended below 50,000 mark.

"BankNifty showcased resilience by successfully defending the critical 50,000 level, closing just below it while rejecting the previous day’s low. This signals strength, with bulls looking to push higher," said Anshul Jain, Head OF Research at Lakshmishree Invesment.

"The virgin daily CPR at 50,200 is now a key level to watch, likely to be tested in the coming session. On the downside, 49,800–49,700 remains a rock-solid support zone. A decisive move above 50,200 could spark further momentum—stay tuned for fireworks!," Jain added.
