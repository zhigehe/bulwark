Nifty Trading Plan
------------------

 

The Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty saw significant selling pressure on February 11, with the formation of long bearish candlestick patterns on the daily charts and a negative crossover in the RSI, indicating weakness. Given the bearish sentiment, experts have advised a "sell on rise" strategy. If the Nifty 50 bounces back, the 23,250–23,300 zone could act as a resistance, but if it falls decisively below the 23,000 support, the index could drop further towards the 22,800 level. Similarly, if the Bank Nifty fails to hold the 49,250 mark (the midline of the Bollinger Bands), selling pressure may extend towards 48,900. However, if it sustains above 49,250, the index could move higher towards the 50,000 mark.

On Tuesday, February 11, the Nifty 50 plunged by 310 points (1.32%) to close at 23,072, while the Bank Nifty closed at 49,403, down 578 points (1.16%), with the market breadth favouring the bears. About 2,386 shares saw a downtrend, while only 231 shares experienced an uptrend on the NSE.

**Nifty Outlook and Strategy**

**Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivative Research Analyst at Samco Securities**

The Nifty remains under strong bearish control, facing persistent selling pressure amid global uncertainties and escalating tariff tensions. The index has failed to sustain any meaningful recovery, with each minor bounce attracting fresh selling, highlighting diminishing investor confidence. A decisive break below the 20-day EMA has weakened the technical structure, turning 23,450–23,500 into a stiff resistance zone, further reinforced by aggressive call writing. The RSI, hovering near 40, reflects deteriorating bullish momentum and sluggish sentiment.

Derivatives data signal a bearish inclination, with Call writers dominating at the 24,000 strike, while Put writers at 22,500 indicate strong downside support. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipping below 0.60 further strengthens the bearish sentiment. With the 23,000–22,970 zone acting as a crucial support, a break below could accelerate selling, making a “sell on rise” strategy favourable unless the Nifty reclaims its key moving averages.

Key Resistance: 23,500, 23,800, 24,000

Key Support: 23,000, 22,700, 22,500

Strategy: Traders can implement a Bear Call Spread by buying the 23,100 strike Call at Rs 109 and selling the 22,850 strike Call at Rs 269.50, both for the February 13 expiry. In case of stop-loss, the strategy can be held until expiry, with the maximum loss capped at Rs 6,712. The maximum profit of Rs 12,038 can be achieved by holding the strategy until expiry, or profits can be booked once the mark-to-market (MTM) profit crosses Rs 6,500.

The Nifty index saw heavy declines on Tuesday, closing below the important Fibonacci level of 23,189. The index faced rejection at the critical Fibonacci level of 23,777 on February 5 and has been making a lower high-lower low sequence for the past 5 trading days, trading below the key trend change level of 23,381.

Nifty is trading below the 200-day EMA at 23,612, an important moving average, with shorter moving averages crossing below longer ones, indicating a bearish scenario. The RSI is at 40.98, signaling a bearish outlook. However, in the past, we have seen RSI bounce back from this level, so a bounce may occur, but it should be sold into. In the options chain, we observe significant unwinding of in-the-money Puts (ITM Puts), further suggesting a bearish scenario. Thus, for this week's expiry, we advise traders to maintain a "sell on rise" view in Nifty and take profits from the bearish trend.

Key Resistance: 23,189, 23,381

Key Support: 22,976, 22,786

Strategy: A Bear Put Spread can be deployed, where traders buy a higher strike price Put and sell a lower strike price Put. The higher strike Put is in-the-money (ITM), while the lower strike put is out-of-the-money (OTM). This strategy results in a net debit, with the cost of the ITM Put being adjusted by the cash flow from selling the OTM Put.

In the previous session, the Nifty broke below the 23,000 mark intraday and closed in the red for the 5th consecutive session. The highest open interest (OI) is at the 23,000 strike on the Put side. If Nifty sustains below the 23,000 mark, we could expect the correction to continue, which could drag the price lower towards the previous swing low near 22,800.

After a sharp decline of 800 points in the past 5 trading sessions, the possibility of a pullback cannot be ruled out, as the hourly RSI is nearing the oversold zone. On the upside, 23,250 is the nearest resistance. A decisive break above 23,250 would signal the first sign of a positive reversal. In summary, bears have tightened their grip with each passing day. For now, traders can use the "sell on rise" strategy to enter the trend, targeting 22,980 followed by 22,800. The nearest hurdle on the upside remains 23,250.

Key Resistance: 23,250

Key Support: 22,800

Strategy: Short positions can be created if Nifty Futures move towards 23,120 and break below 23,000, with 23,100 as the stop-loss and a target of 22,900 followed by 22,800.

**Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning**

**Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivative Research Analyst at Samco Securities**

The Bank Nifty remains under relentless bearish pressure, extending its losing streak amid global economic uncertainty and tariff tensions. Sustained selling at higher levels has prevented the index from staging any meaningful recovery, reinforcing a fragile technical setup. A death crossover, where the 50-day EMA has slipped below the 200-day EMA, signals a deepening bearish trend, while the RSI below 50 highlights waning bullish momentum.

Aggressive call writing at 49,900–50,200 has flipped this zone into a formidable resistance, capping any upside attempts. Derivatives data further strengthens the bearish narrative, with Call writers dominating at 51,000, while Put writers at 49,000 are attempting to hold the downside. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) sliding to 0.79 underscores deteriorating sentiment. With 49,000–48,850 emerging as a crucial support, a breach below this could accelerate selling, reinforcing the case for a "sell on rise" strategy unless bulls reclaim lost ground.

Key Resistance: 49,700, 50,000, 50,500

Key Support: 49,000, 48,700, 48,500

Strategy: Traders can consider selling Bank Nifty February Futures if the price crosses below 49,500–49,450, setting a stop-loss above 49,900. Profit-taking can be considered once the index reaches 49,000–48,900.

**Preeti K Chabra, Founder of Trade Delta**

The Bank Nifty closed below the important trend change level of 50,009. It has been making a lower high-lower low sequence for the past 3 trading days and has given a channel breakdown, suggesting a bearish scenario. The Bank Nifty is trading below the critical 200-day EMA level of 50,200, with shorter moving averages crossing below longer ones, indicating further bearish pressure. The RSI stands at 46.59 on the daily chart, with a bearish crossover and a breach of the trendline on the downside, suggesting further negative momentum.

In the options chain, we observe unwinding in in-the-money Puts, further signaling a bearish scenario. Traders should consider selling Bank Nifty on the rise to take advantage of the bearish trend.

Key Resistance: 49,674, 49,906

Key Support: 49,216, 48,906

Strategy: Sell Bank Nifty futures on the rise for a target of 48,906, with a stop-loss of 49,906.

**Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors**

The Bank Nifty faced resistance near the 50,600 level and reversed downward, witnessing a fall of over 1,400 points in 3 trading sessions. This fall has retraced 50% of the prior rise, which started on January 27, 2025.

Since February 6, not a single candle has closed above the previous day's high, suggesting weakness in the index. On the daily chart, prices have moved towards the mid Bollinger Bands after reversing from the upper bands. For now, a decisive break below 49,250 (the mid-Bollinger Bands level) could accelerate further selling pressure.

In summary, the trend for Bank Nifty has shifted to bearish. A breach below 49,250 can drag the price lower towards 48,900, followed by 48,500. On the upside, 50,040 is a crucial resistance. A break above it may indicate a short-term trend reversal.

Key Resistance: 50,040

Key Support: 48,500

Strategy: Short positions in Bank Nifty Futures can be created below 49,250, with targets of 48,900 followed by 48,500, and a stop-loss at 49,550.
