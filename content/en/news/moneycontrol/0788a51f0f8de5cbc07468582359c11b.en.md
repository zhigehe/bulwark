**Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares**

The market witnessed a fierce tug-of-war between the bulls and bears. The Index opened lower, extending its losses and revisiting its previous swing low of 22,800. However, a strong V-shaped recovery followed, but the inability to sustain upward momentum reflected broader market uncertainty. Ultimately, the Index closed at 23,045.25 with a loss of 26.55 points. Among the sectors, PSU Banks and Metal were the top performers, while heavy beating continued in the Realty segment followed by Auto. After dramatic swings in both directions, the Midcaps and Smallcaps ended the day in the red, with losses of 0.26% each.

The Index formed a long-legged Doji candlestick pattern at the 22,800 level, signalling indecisiveness between bulls and bears. Going forward, the 22,800 level remains a solid support, while the 23,200-23,240 zone will act as a tough resistance.

**Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking**

Markets remained volatile after five consecutive days of decline, ultimately ending flat amid mixed cues. The session started on a weak note, but a gradual recovery in select heavyweight stocks helped trim losses as the day progressed. As a result, the Nifty index closed at 23,045.25 level.

Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping traders engaged—metals, banking, and financials saw some respite, while realty and auto were among the top laggards.

Persistent selling by FIIs, coupled with mixed earnings, continues to weigh on market sentiment, while uncertain global cues add to the pressure. On the technical front, Nifty rebounded after testing its January low of around 22,800, and sustaining above this level could offer some relief. However, the broader trend remains negative unless a clear reversal pattern emerges. Given the current scenario, traders should exercise caution and continue with a hedged approach.
