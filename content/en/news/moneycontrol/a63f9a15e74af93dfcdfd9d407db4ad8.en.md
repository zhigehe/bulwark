-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Union Commerce & Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on February 12 said the government will bring policies to promote manufacturing in toys and footwear manufacturing. Additionally, he said the effort taken so far has resulted in reducing the import of toys by half and increasing exports by 3.5 times, what it used to be 5 years ago.

“Soon (we will) come up with policies to further promote manufacturing in toys and footwear so that we can become a global champion in these sectors in the next 20 years,” Goyal said at the Global Investors Meet - Invest Karnataka 2025 in a keynote address.

On February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the Union Budget a scheme to focus on manufacturing sustainable toys with a "Made in India" brand. Sitharaman announced the setting up of special clusters for enhancing skills and creating a toy manufacturing ecosystem.

Meanwhile, there Goyal said that with the collaboration of state governments and the Central government, India will grow into a $30 trillion economy by 2047. The central government will extend its full support to Karnataka in this regard, Goyal assured. “India grows when the states grow. India prospers when the states prosper. This is the spirit of cooperative federalism driving our success."

He also said that the state was allocated Rs 11 lakh crore for infrastructure development. An industrial smart city is being developed in Tumakuru on a plug-and-play model spanning over 8,000 acres.

The first phase, covering 1,736 acres, is currently under development and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, he added.

He added that India’s export turnover has now reached $800 billion, with Karnataka holding a significant share.

On the [Rs 76,000 crore semiconductor program](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/electronics-industry-body-seeks-pli-scheme-for-non-semicondcutor-sectors-11465061.html), Goyal expressed confidence that Karnataka, with its strong presence in deep-tech industries, will play a leading role in it.

"Our democracy, demand, population, digitalisation, and diversity are India's five key strengths. Soon, 75 new airports, air connectivity to 120 cities under UDAN-2, 114 waterways… and the development of 50 tourist destinations will be implemented. Karnataka will also benefit from these initiatives," he added.

**Solving Bengaluru’s Traffic Woes**

Karnataka’s Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar announced that Rs 1 lakh crore will be allocated to address Bengaluru’s traffic congestion. This investment will be used for the construction of flyovers, bridges, double-decker roads, and new highways.

The announcement comes at a time when Bengaluru is facing massive criticism for traffic congestion and infrastructure challenges.

Industries Minister MB Patil said that Karnataka's business-friendly policies serve as a model for others and emphasised ongoing efforts toward sustainable industrial growth.
