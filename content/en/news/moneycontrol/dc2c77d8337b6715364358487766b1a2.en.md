Binance is still in talks with hacked exchange WazirX to help recover lost funds but a takeover is off the table, a senior executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange has told *Moneycontrol*.

Moneycontrol exclusively reported that WazirX had approached former partner Binance for help in bailing out customers affected by the $230-million cyberattack, in which it lost nearly 45 percent of its crypto assets.

“Those talks are on but I don't think there's much progression there. The talks are still going on between the legal sides of things. I don't think there is a possibility of takeover on the table, but all I can tell is we're trying to find the best solutions possible for the users. We will continue to see what happens,” Vishal Sacheendran, head of regional markets, Binance told *Moneycontrol*.

Sacheendran said that Binance assists every time there's a hack in any part of the world with any crypto exchange. in 2024, the exchange helped recover close to $100 million in hacked funds through its security team.

"So we work with the law enforcement teams of whichever country that they've been hacked, and we work with the exchange itself to track the funds. We help any exchange that’s been hacked, WazirX or whoever it is. Whenever you have a hack in the crypto industry, the reputation of the industry takes a hit. And our job is to maintain the sanctity of the industry,” Sacheendran  said.

After the WazirX’s hack, Binance issued a statement in September accusing it of misleading customers on their relationship.

“The WazirX team and Nischal Shetty continue to mislead WazirX customers and the market regarding the relationship between WazirX and Binance. Binance has not owned, controlled, or operated WazirX at any time, including before, during, or after the July 2024 attack,” Binance said.

WazirX is in the middle of a business restructuring plan to work through rebalancing and distribution of tokens to let creditors get their funds back.

**The Binance-WazirX dispute**

The spat between the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance and the country’s largest exchange WazirX started in August 2022. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) froze WazirX’s Rs 64.67-crore worth of bank assets for allegedly assisting a bunch of accused loan apps in money laundering and fraud through the transfer of virtual crypto assets.

Following this, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took to the X platform (then Twitter) to clarify that his firm didn’t own any equity in WazirX and nor did it control its operations.

This came as a shock to investors while the rift between founders escalated over social media. As of 2019, it was known that WazirX was acquired by Binance through a Binance blog post dated November 21, 2019.
