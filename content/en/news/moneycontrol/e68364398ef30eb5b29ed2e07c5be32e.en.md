Nifty Trade Setup
-----------------

 

The market failed to sustain its intraday rally due to a lack of strength at higher levels, and there was also a death crossover (the 50-day EMA falling below the 200-day EMA), signaling the strong position of bears at Dalal Street. Experts believe it remains a 'sell on rally' market. The index continued its downtrend for the seventh consecutive session. Therefore, if the index decisively breaches 23,000 on a closing basis, the 22,800-22,600 range (Wednesday's low and the low of June 6, 2024) cannot be ruled out in the upcoming sessions. However, in case of a bounce back, 23,250-23,350 will act as an immediate hurdle zone for the index.

**Here are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:**

1) **Key Levels For The [Nifty 50](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/nifty-50-9.html) (23,031)**

Resistance based on pivot points: 23,179, 23,237, and 23,330

Support based on pivot points: 22,993, 22,936, and 22,843

***Special Formation***: The Nifty 50 formed a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating a lack of strength at higher levels. The index remained not only below all key moving averages (10, 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs) but also in the lower band of Bollinger Bands. Furthermore, the momentum indicators, with RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 40.17, stayed in the lower band, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) was below the zero line with a negative crossover, signaling further negativity.

2) **Key Levels For The [Bank Nifty](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/nifty-bank-23.html) (49,360)**

Resistance based on pivot points: 49,705, 49,837, and 50,051

Support based on pivot points: 49,277, 49,145, and 48,931

Resistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 50,378, 51,161

Support based on Fibonacci retracement: 49,276, 47,876

***Special Formation***: The Bank Nifty also reported a bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper wick on the daily timeframe, indicating selling pressure at higher levels. The momentum indicators RSI remained in the lower band, and MACD stayed below the zero line. Additionally, the index traded well below all key moving averages. However, it has consistently defended the midline of Bollinger Bands for the past three straight sessions and the 50% Fibonacci retracement (of the recent rally from 47,844 to 50,642), which is a bit of positive news, though the overall sentiment is still in favour of the bears.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.
