So far this year, FIIs have net sold shares worth Rs 97,464 crore, while DIIs have net bought Rs 93,862 crore worth of shares.

Benchmark [Nifty 50](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/cnx-nifty-9.html) continued to decline for a third consecutive session on Friday, and in a volatile session the index ended lower by 43 points, while [Sensex](https://www.moneycontrol.com/indian-indices/sensex-4.html) closed with a cut of 197 points. Nifty Bank ended lower, while midcap shares outperformed with the Midcap Index closing the session in the green.

On a weekly basis, this was the second week of higher close for the index.

**The Market View**

Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, "After the announcement of RBI's MPC outcome, the Nifty witnessed intraday swing on either side in the mid-part, and finally showed upside recovery from the lows towards the end."

This, he said, indicates downward correction from the hurdle of 23,800 levels (down trendline resistance). "The underlying short-term trend of Nifty is weak, with high volatility," he said.
