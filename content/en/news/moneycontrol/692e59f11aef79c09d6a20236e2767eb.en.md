Mamaearth Q3 FY25 Results: Net profit flat, EBITDA expands
----------------------------------------------------------

 

Honasa Consumer Ltd, the parent company of Mamaearth, reported a net profit of Rs 26 crore for the third quarter of FY25, nearly flat from the previous year. The firm's revenue from operations rose 6 percent year-on-year to Rs 518 crore.

The company’s gross profit margin improved by 132 basis points to 70 percent, while EBITDA stood at Rs 26 crore, translating to an EBITDA margin of 5 percent for the quarter ended December 31, 2024.

Mamaearth said that it continued to grow its market share and household penetration, supported by the strategic rollout of Project Neev to strengthen offline distribution across India’s top 50 cities. The brand expanded its distribution network by 22 percent YoY, reaching over 2.16 lakh FMCG retail outlets as of December 2024, according to NielsenIQ data.

Key categories, including face wash, shampoo, serums, moisturisers, sun care, and baby care, grew approximately 18 percent in the first nine months of FY25. “Our vision remains centered on driving disruptive innovation, deepening offline penetration, and delivering unique value propositions to consumers,” said Varun Alagh, Chairman and CEO of Honasa Consumer Ltd.

For the first nine months of FY25, Honasa’s revenue reached Rs 1,533 crore, marking a 5.8 percent YoY growth. Adjusted for a one-time inventory correction in Q2, revenue stood at Rs 1,596 crore, reflecting a 10.2 percent YoY increase. The EBITDA margin for the nine-month period was 2.7 percent, or 5.9 percent after adjusting for the one-time correction.
