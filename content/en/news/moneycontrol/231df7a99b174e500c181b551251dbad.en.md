Moneycontrol had reported earlier that SEBI may reconsider its decision, following representations from RAs.

In what should come as a big relief to SEBI-registered Research Analysts (RAs) and Investment Advisors (IAs), the market regulator has proposed that the IAs and RAs be allowed to collect an advance fee for a year.

On February 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released a consultation paper proposing that this extension be given.

This is a change to the earlier guidelines, released in January for RAs, in which the analysts were told not to collect fee for more than three months. This has led to a lot of protests from RAs and well-respected ones had said that they would shut down.

Under the existing provisions, IAs are not allowed to collect advance fee for more than two quarter or six months. SEBI's latest proposal will be a relief to IAs as well.

Moneycontrol had written that the RAs are likely to get this relief, from conversations with sources.

In the consultation paper, SEBI said, "SEBI is in receipt of representations from RAs to consider relaxation in advance fee provision. It has been submitted that the provision on advance fee would inter alia disincentivize RAs from offering long term recommendations and shall disrupt the existing practices related to charging of fee and that even the mandate facility to charge fee periodically shall cause inconvenience and shall entail cost to both client and RA."

The paper said that RAs made a representation to have the period extended to a 12-month period. The paper also noted that the annual cap on fees that RAs can collect will offer necessary protection to investors and reiterated that there is also the option to ask for a refund under the current provisions. According to the regulator, extending the period will also incentivise RAs to give long-term recommendations.

SEBI said that IAs had also made similar representations.
