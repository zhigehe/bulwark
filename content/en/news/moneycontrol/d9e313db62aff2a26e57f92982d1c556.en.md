The majority of the companies that made their debut since September last year when the markets were at record levels have demonstrated resilience despite a significant market correction.

Data shows that around 47 companies made their debut on the stock exchanges since September, and 27 continue to trade above their issue prices. Of these, six have extended their listing gains despite the broader market downturn, while 21 have seen the listing gains erode partially but are still above their respective issue prices.

KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration is leading the pack of gainers, which made its debut with a 117 percent premium and has continued its upward trajectory â€“ it is currently trading over 300 percent higher than its issue price.

Similarly, Quadrant Future Tek and Gala Precision Engineering, which listed at 55 percent and 49 percent premiums, have further increased to 92 percent and 90 percent, respectively.

Other stocks, including Diffusion Engineers, Enviro Infra Engineers, Transrail Lighting, and Garuda Construction & Engineering, have also sustained their listing gains despite the correction. Meanwhile, Sagility and Zinka Logistics Solutions, which made their debut at a slight discount, have surged by approximately 67 percent and 87 percent, respectively.

Further, certain IPOs that listed at a premium continue to trade near their listing levels, showcasing resilience amid the correction. Companies such as Waaree Energies, Vishal Mega Mart, Senores Pharmaceuticals, and Transrail Lighting remain stable.

Rajesh Palviya, an analyst at Axis Securities, attributes this stability to low free float, anchor book holdings, and pre-IPO investor lock-ins, which have limited selling pressure. Some IPOs, despite partially erasing their listing gains, continue to trade at significant premiums.  
For instance, Mamata Machinery, which debuted with a 160 percent premium, has corrected but is still trading 75 percent above its issue price. Similarly, Bajaj Housing Finance, initially listing at a 137 percent premium, is now 67 percent up.

Other firms, such as One Mobikwik Systems and Investurus Knowledge Solutions, which debuted with 90 percent and 47 percent premiums, have seen partial corrections but still trade 32 percent and 28 percent higher than their issue prices. Palviya explains that these IPOs have retraced gains due to their high initial valuations and the expiration of lock-in periods, leading to increased selling pressure.

Since September, around 47 companies made their debut on the Indian stock exchanges, collectively raising over Rs 1.11 lakh crore, which is around 65 percent of the total capital raised in 2024.
