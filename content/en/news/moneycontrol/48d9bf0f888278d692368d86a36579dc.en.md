The broader markets bore the brunt of the rout, underperforming the benchmarks as both the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices tumbled over 2 percent.

Indian equities extended their morning losses on February 10, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions with plans to impose fresh duties on all steel and aluminium imports, along with additional reciprocal tariffs. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly weighing tariff concessions to ease upcoming talks with Trump and avert a full-blown trade war.

The sell-off was broad-based, with financials, oil and gas, and metal stocks leading the slide. Market volatility spiked, pushing the India VIX up more than six percent to 14.5.

At 12:50 PM, the Sensex tumbled 640 points, or 0.8 percent, to 77,223, while the Nifty 50 slid 197 points, or 0.8 percent, to 23,360.

"As long as there's no clarity on the next steps—what tariffs the U.S. will impose, on which countries, and how others will respond—the market will remain volatile. These tariff-related developments will have spillover effects on India and other global markets," said Aditi Gupta, Economist at Bank of Baroda.

Gupta noted that uncertainty is driving investors toward safer assets like U.S. equities. "Over the next couple of months, as we get more clarity on U.S. policies—who is imposing tariffs, who is retaliating, and to what extent—markets should stabilize. Right now, the market sentiment is largely driven by nervousness. Once the policy outlook is clearer, some normalcy should return," she added.

Foreign investors extended their exodus, offloading Rs 10,179 crore worth of Indian equities in February so far, as a stronger U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields eroded the appeal of emerging markets. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that with the dollar index above 108 and U.S. 10-year bond yields at 4.5 percent, foreign institutional investors are likely to continue selling into rallies, capping any major upside.

The rupee hit an all-time low on February 10, sliding 49 paise to open at 87.92 per dollar, in tandem with a broader decline in Asian currencies. The fresh tariff threats from Trump have only added to the pressure. Amit Pabari, MD of CR Forex Advisors, expects the rupee to trade in the 87.50-88.20 range in the near term, with 87.50 serving as a crucial support level amid global and domestic policy shifts.

The broader markets bore the brunt of the rout, underperforming the benchmarks as both the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices tumbled over 2 percent.

All 13 major sectoral indices were in the red, with the metals pack taking the biggest hit. The BSE Metal index plunged nearly three percent after Trump’s February 9 statement vowing to slap 25 percent duties on steel and aluminium imports, on top of existing levies. All 15 stocks in the index declined, with Tata Steel, SAIL, and Vedanta sinking between three and four percent.

Trent, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Bajaj Finance, and ONGC were among the worst performers, slipping 2-4 percent, while Britannia, Tata Consumer, Kotak Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, and Wipro managed to stay afloat, rising 0.3-1.4 percent.

On the technical front, Nifty 50's 20-day moving average is offering support at 23,300, said Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan. "If Nifty falls below 23,300, the next support is at 23,280. Immediate resistance stands at 23,600," he noted.

Investors now turn their focus to CPI inflation data from both India and the U.S., scheduled for release on February 12.
