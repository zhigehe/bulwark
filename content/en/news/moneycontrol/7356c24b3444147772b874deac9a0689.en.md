Trump Tariffs
-------------

 

As former U.S. President Donald Trump doubles down on tariffs, history offers a cautionary tale. His latest move—a 25 percent duty on steel and iron imports—mirrors the protectionist push of his first term. But past experience suggests such measures do more harm than good, burdening businesses, dampening job growth, and squeezing household incomes.

During Trump’s initial term, tariffs on nearly $400 billion worth of goods led to unintended consequences. A 2019 Federal Reserve study found that industries most exposed to these trade barriers saw job losses instead of gains. Manufacturing employment shrank by about 75,000 positions, as rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs erased any benefits from shielding domestic producers. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2020, trade barriers had shaved 0.3 percent off real GDP and reduced the average household income by $580.

Now, the steel industry is back in the spotlight. Despite being the world's fourth-largest producer, the U.S. relies heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Meanwhile, China dominates the global steel market, churning over 1,019 million metric tons annually—more than half the world’s supply. With a surplus keeping prices competitive, higher U.S. tariffs may do little to curb imports in the short term.

What they will likely do, however, is ripple through key industries. Automakers, construction firms, and appliance manufacturers—major consumers of steel—will face higher costs, potentially passing them on to consumers already grappling with affordability.

Coming inroads, global investment banks, including Morgan Stanley and Nomura Holdings, have flagged India as one of the most exposed economies to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs. India’s vulnerability stems from the stark gap between the tariffs it levies on U.S. goods and the relatively lower duties imposed by the U.S. on Indian exports. Analysts assessing potential tariff hikes based on a like-for-like model suggest this imbalance could make India a prime target if Trump follows through on his trade policy rhetoric.

**Apollo Hospitals (Rs 6,317.35, -6.6%)**

Shares fell amid a spike in trading volumes despite solid Q3 numbers.

Bull Case: Reduced losses in Apoll 24/7, AHLL breakeven by Q1 FY26 and mega capex plans for the company's flagship hospitals business to ensure long-term growth. Continued focus to improve ARPOBs and occupancy to yield solid earnings growth for the hospital's segment.

Bear Case: Delays in achieving AHLL breakeven can weigh on the company's earnings growth, especially as it embarks on a mega capex drive to for hospital expansion.

**FSN E-Commerce Ventures (Rs 167.4, -1.2%)**

Reported Q3 earnings.

Bull Case: Analysts at Morgan Stanley built in a 29 percent CAGR for the company over FY24-27 led by 29 percent growth in its beauty business. On top of that, Morgan Stanley also views Nykaa as a consumer business with a technology edge. The brokerage firm also likes Nykaa's consistent topline delivery in beauty over the last few quarters despite a weak demand environment.

Bear Case: Increasing competition in the BPC space could impact margins and market shares. Further, if brands decide to leave the platform, it could create negative publicity.
