The National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) has announced its foray into the equity and equity derivatives segment, marking a significant shift beyond its traditional agri-focused operations, Mint reported.

The decision was approved by the NCDEX board on February 12. "The Board of Directors of the Exchange at its meeting held on Wednesday, February 12, 2025, approved the launch of the Equity and Equity Derivatives segment based on a feasibility study and business plan prepared for the same," NCDEX said in a statement, as per the Mint report.

The exchange plans to invest an estimated Rs 400-600 crore in this expansion, according to the announcement quoted by Mint. "The Exchange will benefit from its entry into the equity and equity derivatives segment as the segment is very large, growing, and offers an opportunity for NCDEX to diversify beyond the agri segment. The diversification is also expected to benefit the agri segment through significant synergies," NCDEX said.

The announcement came alongside the release of NCDEX’s unaudited standalone and consolidated financial results for Q3 FY25 and the nine-month period ended December 31, 2024.
