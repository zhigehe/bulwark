The Union Budget's tax relief for the middle class and Reserve Bank of India's rate cut are a double bonanza to spur consumption, with experts predicting that the extra cash in consumers' hands will be directed towards the lagging FMCG and consumer discretionary segments.

In the Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the income tax exemption limit under the new IT regime has been raised from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, reducing the tax burden on consumers.

In a note, domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal stated that unlike freebies or welfare schemes, the tax cut offers immediate relief to the middle-class and the long-term savings assurance fosters sustained consumption sentiments with no fund leakages and cost of operations.

This measure is likely to result in Rs 1 lakh crore of savings for tax payers, which will provide a much-needed booster to drive consumption, which has been under pressure. Rural consumption has already started seeing a revival over the past six months. However, urban consumption has been moderating, leading to an overall decline in consumption for both essentials and non-essentials, stated the report by the brokerage firm.

While the FMCG sector is expected to see the best returns, non-essentials such as paints, quick-service restaurants (QSR), and discretionary items are also likely to see a boost.

Over the past two to three years, consumer staples firms have struggled with revenue, margin, and bottom-line growth, with their growth rate slowing by 200-400 bps compared to the period from FY13 to FY23, said the brokerage firm.

On the QSR front as well, there are expectations of a relief. "While we previously held a cautious view on QSR, we have now changed our view to positive," said the brokerage. Its outlook on jewellery and innerwear remains positive, while it maintained its neutral view on paints, considering the slow industry growth and rising competition.

"The budgetary benefits will not see an immediate growth recovery; we expect a sequential improvement in the coming quarters. Our top picks are HUL, Godrej Consumer Products, Dabur, Page Industries, Titan, and P N Gadgil," added the brokerage firm.

The domestic broking firm also argues that tax-saving is better for consumption than rural schemes. Freebies, such as subsidies, cash transfers, and free goods are primarily allocated to essential needs like food, electricity, and fuel, resulting in a limited impact on incremental spending on consumption.

"Furthermore, these measures do not drive premiumisation, as consumers tend to focus on affordability over upgrading their purchases. Tax exemptions are generally more effective in driving demand since they encourage broader consumer spending, rather than just subsidizing necessities," added the broking entity.

The listed players are likely to see the most gains from the tax savings for the middle-class compared to rural welfare, as the middle-income consumers are the target audience for listed firms, as there is a higher preference on branded products.

Therefore, with the listed consumer universe (ex-apparel, consumer durable) generating revenue of Rs 44,000 crore in FY24, even a partial redirection of these savings can accelerate growth.
