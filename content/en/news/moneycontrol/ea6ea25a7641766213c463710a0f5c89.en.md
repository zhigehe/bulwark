Over the past 6 months, shares of Hindalco have dropped 3 percent
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 

Hindalco shares are likely to witness a positive uptick on February 14, driven by a strong performance in the third quarter (Q3FY25). Brokerages have endorsed the Aditya Birla Group company for its solid operational results in the Indian market, though they remain cautious about the potential impact of US tariffs in the future.

JPMorgan reiterated an "overweight" rating with a target price of Rs 670, highlighting the operational beat in the Indian business driven by lower costs and improved performance in the copper segment. While ongoing projects remain on track, analysts are keeping an eye on the possible effects of US tariffs.

Earlier this week, former US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports starting March 12. However, experts believe Hindalco will face minimal impact, as its subsidiary Novelis relies heavily on recycled aluminum (over 60 percent), reducing its exposure to import duties.

CLSA maintained an "outperform" rating with a target price of Rs 800, noting that Q3 aluminum profitability met expectations. Analysts project a steady Rs 600 crore profit from the copper business going forward.

Hindalco reported a 60 percent YoY increase in consolidated net profit for the December quarter at Rs 3,735 crore, with operational revenue rising 11 percent YoY to Rs 58,390 crore. The Aluminum India upstream business posted record quarterly EBITDA with industry-leading margins of 42 percent, while the downstream segment saw a 36 percent EBITDA growth. The copper business also recorded an 18 percent EBITDA growth.

Over the past 6 months, shares of Hindalco have dropped 3 percent, as against benchmark index Nifty 50's 4 percent decline.
