"Q4 earnings growth won't be significantly different from Q3, considering that Q3, despite being a festive season, failed to deliver strong results," Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director at Ladderup Wealth Management said in an interview to Moneycontrol.

According to him, earnings growth should be on a similar line, and "we might see some further correction in stock prices as the market aligns with this new reality," he said.

In terms of attractive valuations within the current market, he believes private banks remain appealing. "They are currently trading at a discount compared to their long-term averages, and with markets stabilizing, deposit growth could accelerate, further improving their performance," said Raghvendra, who leads the private wealth management business with more than 30 years of corporate experience.

**What is your opinion on the RBI's policy decision?**

The RBI's decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was largely anticipated, considering the slight slowdown in growth during Q2 and the moderating inflation after October. This move should help encourage consumer spending and overall economic activity. While it will take some time for the full effect to be felt, especially with expectations for only modest rate cuts – reflected in the RBI's neutral stance – and continued global economic uncertainties. There is a need for high growth in corporate credit from the banking system as that has a much higher impact on future growth. Hopefully a benign monetary policy should trigger more private sector investments.

**Do you expect the RBI to revise its FY26 growth forecast upward in the upcoming policy meetings, particularly after the start of the rate cut cycle and the recent fiscally prudent Union Budget?**

The RBI has projected a 6.7% real GDP growth rate for FY26. While the recent rate cut and fiscally prudent Union Budget are positive developments, it's too early to definitively expect an upward revision. The RBI's forecast already factors in the anticipated benefits from these measures. Whether they revise it upwards in future meetings will depend on the sustained strength of multiple growth drivers.

Historically, government expenditure has played a significant role, and a further boost from private investment and household consumption would certainly increase the likelihood of an upward revision. However, we also need to remain mindful of global headwinds that could impact the outlook.

**Has the earnings season so far met your expectations? Do you anticipate better growth in Q4FY25 compared to the past few quarters?**

After Q2, earnings expectations were largely reset downwards. So far, the results have been slightly lower than even those modest expectations. Average earnings growth at the index level for the Nifty 50 (of the 26 companies that have reported) has been around 4.4%, as against 4.2% in Q2. The valuations at which broader market stocks were trading did not align with the modest earnings growth these companies have reported; therefore, we have witnessed some correction in the last four months.

In my opinion, Q4 won't be significantly different from Q3, considering that Q3, despite being a festive season, failed to deliver strong results. Earnings growth should be on a similar line, and we might see some further correction in stock prices as the market aligns with this new reality.

**Are the equity markets showing less concern about the tariff factor now, gaining stronger support from the recent Union Budget and RBI policy decision?**

While the recent Union Budget and RBI policy decisions are providing some support, the US government's inconsistent approach to tariffs continues to create uncertainty. Although this isn't an immediate crisis for Indian equity markets, we can expect some volatility due to the lack of clarity in the US stance. The on-again, off-again tariffs on countries like Mexico and Canada have left the market guessing. The broader trend suggests a move towards increased protectionism in US policies in the coming years, which could significantly impact global trade and margins.

**Do you see attractive valuations in consumption stocks, particularly after management commentaries and earnings reports?**

The valuation of consumption stocks, or the consumer sector overall, appears attractive primarily on a relative basis. While these stocks are currently trading at or slightly above their long-term averages, they seem reasonably priced compared to other, potentially overvalued, segments of the market. Management commentaries suggest subdued urban demand, but an encouraging uptick in rural demand and spending.

The recent tax relaxations in the Union Budget should provide support for consumption expenditure, as they'll lead to higher disposable incomes for taxpayers. However, it's important to recognize that this might not spur an immediate surge in consumption, as the benefits of these tax cuts will be realized gradually through lower TDS (tax deducted at source) deductions and reduced self-assessment tax payments next year.

**Which three sectors do you see as promising for investment after the Union Budget and RBI policy decision?**

Given the government's sustained emphasis on infrastructure development and capital expenditure, coupled with the expectation of increased private capital expenditure following the recent rate cut announcement, I believe the manufacturing and capital goods sectors are well-positioned to benefit. These sectors are poised for sustained growth. In terms of attractive valuations within the current market, private banks remain appealing. They are currently trading at a discount compared to their long-term averages, and with markets stabilizing, deposit growth could accelerate, further improving their performance.
