**Steel Tariffs**

President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25 percent import tax on all steel and aluminum entering the U.S., with Canada expected to feel the most impact. He also mentioned upcoming announcements on tariffs against nations that tax U.S. imports but did not specify which countries or any possible exemptions. During his first term, he imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.

**Musk Strikes Back**

Elon Musk is calling for the impeachment of New York federal judge Paul Engelmayer after an order temporarily restricted him and his DOGE team from accessing U.S. Treasury payment systems and sensitive data. Over the weekend, Musk took to X, calling Engelmayer “a corrupt judge protecting corruption” and demanding his immediate impeachment.

**T-Mobile, Starlink begin testing**

T-Mobile has begun large-scale testing of its satellite-to-cell service using SpaceX's Starlink, aiming to eliminate mobile dead zones and improve connectivity in remote areas. This initiative could transform mobile coverage by merging traditional networks with satellite technology for seamless global access.

**France's AI Bet**

French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will invest 109 billion euros ($112.5 billion) in artificial intelligence over the coming years, with details to be shared at the Paris AI summit starting Monday.

**Boeing's Job Cuts**

Boeing has warned about laying off around 400 employees from its Space Launch System moon rocket program. The job cuts come amid delays and rising costs in NASA’s Artemis program, which was launched during Trump’s first term and aims to send astronauts back to the moon. Its budget is projected to reach $93 billion by year-end.

**Tesla Sales Fall**

Tesla’s sales in Germany fell 59 percent in January, the same month CEO Elon Musk criticized Germans for dwelling on “past guilt” over Nazi-era crimes and encouraged support for a nationalist party in the country’s election.
