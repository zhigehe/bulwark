[Balu Forge Industries](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/machine-tools/baluforgeindustries/BAL01), a portfolio company of ace investor Ashish Kacholia, delivered an impressive set of financial results for the third quarter of FY25, showcasing remarkable growth across key metrics.

EBITDA margins expanded by a remarkable 422 basis points, from 22.24 percent in Q3FY24 to 26.47 percent, driven by operational efficiencies and a strategic focus on high-margin, value-added niche products.
