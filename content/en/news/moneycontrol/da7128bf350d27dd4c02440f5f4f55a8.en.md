Brainbees Solutions, the company that runs and operates FirstCry, saw its losses narrow 69.2 percent from Rs 48.4 crore in Q3FY24 to Rs 14.7 crore in Q3FY25, regulatory filings showed.

During the same period, the company’s revenue from operations was up 14.3 percent from Rs 1,900 crore to Rs 2,172 crore as more users came on to the platform and the company’s businesses matured.

“Q3FY25 has been our best quarter in terms of profitability in the last four years. We have achieved the highest Adjusted EBITDA for our Consolidated Business as well as India Multi-channel business in the last four years,” the company said in its investor presentation.

The company had delivered a total of 9.8 million orders in Q3FY24 which increased 13 percent to 11.1 million in Q3FY25.

“We remain very optimistic and will keep working hard to deliver on both growth and profitability expansion front on YoY basis,” the statement added.

The company now had 9.8 million annual unique transacting customers which was a 17 percent increase on a year-on-year (YoY) basis from 8.4 million in Q3FY24.

**Acquisition**

The company, which already runs unicorn Globalbees and others, is also acquiring shares in Digital Age Retail Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.

“Approved the proposal to invest an amount of Rs. 2,99,59,91,448.02, by way of subscription to equity shares of Digital Age Retail Private Limited (DARP), wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in one or more tranches,” the company said.

**Shuts company owned store, records loss**

In Q3’FY25 Brainbees witnessed the closure of a few company owned company operated (COCO) stores. "We closed COCO stores for the first time since expansion," the company said.

It also saw a fire break out at one of its facilities which resulted in a loss.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2024, fire at warehouses of the Group in Hooghly, West Bengal and Bhiwandi, Maharashtra destroyed the entire inventory and property, plant and equipment therein, the company said.

"The group has filed claims under the insurance policies, which adequately cover the losses incurred. Subsequent to nine month ended December 31, 2024, entire claim has been settled by the insurance company. The company has recorded for the required losses and no further adjustment is required in these results," the company added.
