Shares of Sun TV Network tanked over 7 percent on February 10, weighed down by the company's disappointing quarterly earnings which saw margin pressure and a decline in advertising revenue.

The South India-based broadcaster reported a 20 percent on-year decline in net profit at Rs 363 crore for the December quarter, compared to Rs 453.9 crore in Q3 FY24. Revenue from operations also fell 10.4 percent to Rs 827.6 crore, down from Rs 923.2 crore in the year-ago period.

Advertisement revenue also contracted to Rs 332.17 crore, lower than the Rs 355.43 crore that was clocked in Q3 FY24. Meanwhile, declining ad revenue especially impacted the broadcasters operational performance as EBITDA margin sharply eroded to 53.7 percent in Q3 as compared to 63.8 percent in the year ago period.

At 09.38 am shares of [Sun TV Network](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/mediaentertainment/suntvnetwork/STN01) were trading at Rs 602.25 on the NSE.
