Shares [Suven Pharmaceuticals](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pharmaceuticalsdrugs/suvenpharmaceuticals/SP19) rallied as much as 6 percent to Rs 1,108 in early trade on February 13, snapping its four-day losing streak on the bourses, after the company delivered a robust performance in the December quarter.

The biopharmaceutical company's net profit surged 77.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 82.9 crore from Rs 46.8 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations also witnessed a sharp uptick of 39.8 percent, reaching Rs 307.2 crore compared to Rs 219.8 crore in Q3FY24.

The key driver behind this growth was its pharma CDMO business, which recorded a remarkable 101 percent year-on-year increase, fueled by ongoing research and development efforts and business expansion initiatives.

Operationally, the company reported strong growth, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) soaring 78.2 percent to Rs 117.8 crore, while margins expanded to 38.4 percent from 30.1 percent a year ago. Gross margins for the quarter stood at 71.5 percent, with adjusted EBITDA margins at 38.7 percent.

The pharma CDMO segment continued to gain traction, with a twofold rise in requests for quotations during the period, reflecting robust demand across multiple development stages amid supportive macroeconomic conditions.

The company strengthened its pipeline by adding two new molecules during the quarter—one advancing into phase 3 and another directly entering phase 3 as a lateral inclusion. With these additions, Suven now has 15 active phase 3 projects spanning nine molecules. Meanwhile, the specialty chemicals CDMO segment, which had faced a downturn in the previous quarter, showed early signs of recovery, and the company remains optimistic about a sustained improvement in the coming quarters.
