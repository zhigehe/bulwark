Nazara Technologies Ltd. shares opened in the red on February 14, after the gaming and e-sports platform operator reported a fall in net profit for the quarter ended December (Q3) of the current financial year (FY25).

The firm posted a 53.6 percent fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 13.68 crore for Q3FY25. This is a decline from the Rs 29.52 crore profit recorded in the same period last year, according to a regulatory filing.

Revenue from operations, however, jumped 66.9 percent to Rs 534.7 crore for the quarter, from Rs 320.4 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. This was driven by a significant jump in the company's advertising revenues that rose nearly six-fold to Rs 147.87 crore for the quarter, from Rs 26.1 crore in the same quarter last year.

At 9.17 am, [Nazara Technologies](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/software/nazaratechnologies/NT) shares were quoting Rs 161.1 on the NSE, lower by 1.1 percent compared to the previous close.

"This quarter’s performance reflects our continued focus on execution and growth. By expanding our gaming ecosystem, partnering with globally recognized IPs, and driving high-impact acquisitions, we are well-positioned to establish Nazara as a truly global gaming leader from India" said Nazara founder Nitish Mittersain in a statement.
