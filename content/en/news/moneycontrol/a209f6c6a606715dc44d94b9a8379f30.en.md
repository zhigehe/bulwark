World Street
------------

 
  

Donald Trump’s surprise move on Ukraine policy signals a potential shift in U.S. diplomacy, while inflation concerns are keeping the Federal Reserve cautious on rate cuts. Meanwhile, job cuts at JPMorgan and Chevron highlight corporate restructuring, and Cisco delivers a strong earnings rebound. All this and more on the February 13 edition of World Street.

**Trump Signals Peace Talks**  
Former President Donald Trump unexpectedly shifted U.S. policy on Ukraine, announcing that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks after a surprise prisoner exchange. Trump, who spent over an hour on the phone with Putin, expressed optimism about a potential resolution, saying, “I think we’re on the way to getting peace.” He later spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but remained vague on whether Ukraine would have an equal role in U.S.-Russia negotiations.

**US Inflation Rises**Inflation ticked higher last month as prices for groceries, gasoline, and rent climbed, putting more pressure on American households and businesses. The consumer price index rose 3 percent in January from a year ago, up slightly from 2.9 percent in December. The increase could strengthen the Federal Reserve’s case for holding off on interest rate cuts.

**Powell Dismisses Political Pressure**  
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against former President Trump’s calls for lower interest rates, saying political pressure won’t influence the central bank’s decisions. Speaking before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell assured lawmakers that the Fed would continue making policy decisions based purely on economic conditions.

 **JPMorgan Begins Job Cuts**JPMorgan Chase has begun laying off employees, with fewer than 1,000 job cuts expected in February, according to Barron’s. The bank reportedly plans further layoffs in March, May, June, August, and September as part of a broader restructuring. A company spokesperson stated that JPMorgan regularly adjusts staffing based on business needs.

**Cisco Posts Earnings Rebound**  
Cisco’s stock jumped about 6 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue growth for its fiscal second quarter. Revenue climbed 9 percent from the previous year to $12.79 billion, marking a turnaround after four consecutive quarters of declines.

**Chevron Plans Workforce Reduction**  
Chevron is planning deep job cuts, with up to 20 percent of its workforce set to be eliminated by the end of 2026. The oil giant, which employed over 45,000 people at the end of 2023, said the reductions are part of a cost-cutting strategy aimed at improving efficiency and long-term growth. The company is also looking to sell assets and expand automation to save between $2 billion and $3 billion.
