NATCO Pharma share price on Friday slumped another 10 percent after weak earnings for the third quarter of the current fiscal. The shares of the company declined 20 percent a day earlier on Thursday.

At around 10:40 AM, the stock was trading at Rs 875.50 per share on the NSE, down 10.21 percent after the firm reported a 37.75 percent decline in consolidated net profit in the December quarter. The stock had tanked 19.99 percent to settle at Rs 973.40 on the BSE on Thursday. Intra-day, it hit the lower circuit limit of Rs 973.35. At the NSE, it cracked 19.99 percent to Rs 975.05 -- the lower circuit limit.

The company's market valuation eroded nearly Rs 6,000-crore in two days to Rs 15,722.26 crore on the NSE on February 14. In traded volume terms, 44.90 lakh shares of the firm were traded at the NSE during the day.  
The analysts at the domestic brokerage Dolat Capital said "Natco is facing challenges in base business growth ex Revlimid  
as the ramp up across the segments is not in line with expectations, which has also led to significant erosion of core margins ex Revlimid."

"FY26 sales growth will depend on Revlimid price erosion. The company expects a significant drop in FY27 earnings due to  
increased competition in Revlimid sales post-patent expiry," it added.
