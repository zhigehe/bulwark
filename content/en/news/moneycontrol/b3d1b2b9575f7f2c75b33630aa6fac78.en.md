The broader indices performed in line with the main indices, experiencing volatility.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Dear Reader,**

One of the most eventful weeks of the year concluded with benchmark indices closing 0.45 percent higher. The week was marked by two significant events: the finance minister's budget presentation, which included major tax relief, and the RBI governor's decision to reduce repo rates by 25 basis points. These developments led to a higher closing in the markets for the second consecutive week, breaking a four-month losing streak.

The broader indices performed in line with the main indices, experiencing volatility due to the budget and repo rate announcements, mixed quarterly earnings, FII selling, and global market reactions to US tariff policies. In terms of sectoral performance, FMCG stocks fell around 5 percent, Realty stocks lost 3.5 percent, Capital Goods declined by 2.4 percent, and Power sector stocks were down by nearly 2 percent. On the gainers' side, healthcare and metals stocks added 3 percent, while IT stocks rose by nearly 2 percent.

FIIs sold equities worth Rs 8,852.31 crore during the week, bringing the total sales to Rs 97,554 crore in the first six weeks of 2025. The Indian rupee weakened significantly, testing a fresh record low of 87.59 against the US dollar. By February 7, the rupee closed at 87.42 per dollar, down 81 paise from its January 31 closing of 86.61.

US markets closed lower on Friday in the global market following President Donald Trump's announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on many countries. While specific countries were not identified, Trump suggested this broad effort could help address US budget issues. The week began with Trump announcing 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which were postponed for a month, while a 10 percent levy on Chinese imports was implemented.

European markets showed positive performance, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index ending 0.60 percent higher, Italy's FTSE closing 1.60 percent higher, DAX up 0.25 percent, CAC 40 gaining 0.29 percent, and UK's FTSE 100 adding 0.31 percent. The Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent and halved its forecast for UK economic growth to 0.75 percent for the year.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell nearly 2 percent due to hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan, strengthening the yen against the dollar. Chinese markets rose 1.63 percent in a shortened week, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 4.49 percent, led by technology company stocks. On a positive note, 77 percent of S&P 500 Index companies reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.

Although the US markets closed negatively, BJP's landslide victory in Delhi may keep market sentiments positive.

**A possible short-covering**

The Nifty index closed higher for the second consecutive week, following four months of decline—the longest losing streak since 2001. While the index struggled to surpass 23800, it may test 23500-23180 before attempting to move higher.

The market has been falling for months and is now considered oversold. This decline has led to multiple sentiment extremes that need to stabilise before we can anticipate another surge in extremes.

Nifty has declined for the fourth consecutive month, but during this period, the contract size of the benchmark index has changed. After adjusting for contract sizes, we observe that the post-expiry position in index futures held by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) is at an all-time high. Such extremes have historically been significant turning points for the market. While a bit of short covering might have begun, there is still a long way to go. This situation indicates that the markets could rise as short sellers are compelled to cover their positions.

However, macroeconomic uncertainty could limit the upside. At present, the government is actively working to inject more liquidity into the markets, which may support upward movement.

The number of stocks below the 100-day average out of the Nifty 500 hit a low of 13, the lowest reading since COVID-19 in 2020. If things are this bad, even in a bear market, there should be some temporary recovery before markets fall further. When everything has fallen, it's time for some to bounce back.

The 20-day A/D ratio has started to pull out of the oversold readings near the lower red lines. On the other hand, we are not near the upper red lines to say that an overbought state has been reached. Markets are moving back and forth, and we need to give it time for some more positivity to unfold.

**Sector Rotation**

The benchmark index, Nifty 50, experienced a modest increase of just 0.33 percent this week. Only two sector indices changed quadrants this week, and both have lost momentum.

The Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty Auto, and Nifty FMCG sectors are the only ones in the Improving Quadrant that have gained momentum. All other indices remained in the same quadrant as last week, showing either a slight loss of momentum or remaining flat.

On the Daily RRG, Nifty FMCG entered the Leading quadrant last week from the Weakening but could not sustain it; it went back to Weakening. Nifty Commodities entered the Lagging quadrant, indicating its underperformance with respect to the Benchmark. Nifty Infra, Nifty Metal, Nifty CPSE, Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty PSE, and Nifty Energy continued their underperformance and remained in the Lagging quadrant.

In the Lagging quadrant, an increase in momentum was seen on the last day of the week in Nifty Healthcare, Nifty Pharma, and, to some extent, Nifty Media. A good increase in momentum was seen in Nifty Consumer Durables, which led it to the Improve quadrant from the Lagging. Nifty Realty & Nifty India Consumption in the Improving quadrant are headed towards the Leading quadrant. Finally, Nifty Auto, Nifty Financial Services, Nifty Bank & Nifty Pvt Bank Outperformed Nifty 50 and entered the Leading quadrant from the Improving quadrant.
