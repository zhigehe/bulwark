[Eicher Motors’](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-lcvshcvs/eichermotors/EM) international business is firing on all cylinders, with strong retail momentum driving growth across key markets. From April to December, the company sold around 70,000 units overseas, marking a robust 38.5 percent year-on-year growth.

"More importantly, retail growth has been very good. It is tracking ahead of wholesale throughout the year," said Eicher’s management, emphasizing that retail sales are 8-9 percent higher than wholesale numbers—a sign of sustained customer demand.

Despite global economic uncertainties, Eicher remains optimistic about its long-term potential in exports. "As I always mentioned, in international markets, we are cautiously optimistic. Though the sentiments are slightly weaker, we see our positions getting cemented over time," the Royal Enfield maker said during the post-result earnings call on February 10.

For now, the approach remains steady and strategic. "It is doing well. Not that the macros are behind, but we are going slowly and steadily, and our progress has been very good," the management affirmed.

Among the standout markets leading this charge are the UK, Brazil, Italy, Europe, and South America. The company has also expanded into Bangladesh, setting up a CKD (Completely Knocked Down) operation and launching one of Dhaka’s largest flagship stores.

Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on brand building and expand via direct subsidiaries in select markets. "In some markets, we are taking over direct entry to our subsidiaries and all those things, because we see it as a good market for us in the long term," they added.
