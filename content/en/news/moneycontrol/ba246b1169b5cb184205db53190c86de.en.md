State-owned ITI Ltd. shares slipped five percent in trade on February 14, after reporting a net loss for the quarter ended December (Q3) of the current financial year (FY25).

ITI narrowed its net loss to Rs 48.9 crore for the three months ended December, from Rs 101.3 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue from operations surged 299.7 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,034.5 crore, up from Rs 258.8 crore, driven by strong operational performance despite higher raw material costs.

At the operating level, ITI reduced its EBITDA loss to Rs 10.6 crore in Q3 FY25, a significant improvement from the Rs 43.5 crore loss a year ago.

At 12 pm, [ITI](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/telecommunications-equipment/iti/ITI) shares were quoting Rs 271.5 on the NSE, lower by 4.5 percent on the NSE.
