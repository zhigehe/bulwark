### **Procurement Forecast Issued Under Biden Administration**

The procurement forecast which identifies Tesla as the supplier for this armored vehicle contract was revised in December 2024 under President Biden. Notably, the Tesla line item was last modified on December 13, 2024, raising questions about whether this contract will proceed as planned under the Trump administration. Given the shifting political landscape, it remains to be seen whether this agreement will face additional scrutiny through DOGE or revisions before finalization.

### **Tesla’s Growing Role in Police Fleets**

While Tesla is best known for producing high-performance electric cars for consumers, the company has increasingly found a foothold in government and defense-related applications. [Law enforcement agencies in Canada](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/westshore-rcmp-take-delivery-of-canadas-first-tesla-model-y-police-cruiser/), the U.S., and internationally have already adopted Tesla vehicles due to their speed, efficiency, and l[ower operating costs compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/somerset-police-department-expects-tesla-model-y-cruiser-to-save-them-nearly-84000-over-10-years/). This potential contract signals a new avenue for Tesla, integrating armored EVs into the security and diplomatic transport sectors.

### **Challenges** With Armored EVs

While Tesla’s technology presents clear advantages, several questions remain about the implementation of armored EVs in government fleets. Armoring a vehicle adds significant weight, which could impact range and efficiency. However, Tesla’s long range EVs may mitigate these concerns.

If finalized, this contract could set a precedent for further government adoption of EVs in security and defense roles. It may also signal growing confidence in Tesla’s ability to deliver specialized vehicle solutions beyond the consumer market.
