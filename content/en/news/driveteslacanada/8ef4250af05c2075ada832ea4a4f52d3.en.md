Tesla has officially launched Full Self-Driving (FSD) in Mexico, marking the first expansion of its advanced driver-assistance software outside of the U.S. and Canada. The move comes as a surprise, as Tesla had [previously indicated that China and Europe](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-shares-updated-fsd-development-roadmap-with-focus-on-hw4-ai4/) would be the next major markets for FSD expansion in 2025.

The launch of FSD in Mexico came as a surprise, and wasn’t announced at first by Tesla themselves, but rather by owners who reported receiving the software update on social media. One of those reports was made by the Tesla Owners Mexico account on X, to which the Tesla AI account responded with ‘¡Hola México!’, confirming it was an official expansion of FSD.

According to various reports on social media, Mexico received FSD v13.2.6 on AI4 vehicles.

**Why Mexico Before China and Europe?**
---------------------------------------

Tesla has long indicated that China and Europe would be the next major FSD markets, with CEO Elon Musk previously stating that regulatory approvals in those regions were expected in 2025. However, launching FSD in Mexico first suggests that Tesla faced fewer regulatory hurdles in the country compared to the strict requirements in the European Union or the complexities of the Chinese market.

In Europe, Tesla faces stringent safety and compliance standards, with regulators requiring additional validation before approving FSD. Similarly, China has unique data security laws and restrictions on mapping and autonomous driving technologies, which have [delayed Tesla’s ability to roll out FSD there](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-outlines-hurdles-tesla-faces-in-bringing-fsd-to-china/).

**What’s Next?**
----------------

With FSD now available in Mexico, Tesla will likely monitor its performance and user feedback before proceeding with further international expansions. While China and Europe remain key targets, the unexpected launch in Mexico showcases Tesla’s ability to pivot its strategy based on market conditions and regulatory opportunities.
