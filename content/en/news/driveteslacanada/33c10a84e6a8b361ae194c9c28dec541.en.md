Tesla made two important updates to the [referral program](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/referral/franklin71798) in Canada on Monday night, adding back the Model 3, as well as adding the Cybertruck to the program for the first time north of the border.

Tesla [revamped their referral program](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-brings-referral-program-to-canada-offers-1-99-financing-on-model-y/) in late August last year, but a little over a month after its return, Tesla abruptly [removed the Model 3](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-removes-model-3-from-referral-program-in-canada/) from the program in Canada. It was a strange move as Tesla kept the Model 3 in the program in the US, leaving Canadian buyers only able to get a referral discount on the Model S, Model X, and Model Y.

Just as quietly as Tesla removed the Model 3 from the program last year, the company added it back on Monday night. According to the mobile app, buyers who purchase their Model 3 with a [referral link will](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/referral/franklin71798) receive a $650 discount.

While this will be a welcomed change, that discount won’t offset the [massive price increases Tesla just instituted](https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/tesla-increases-prices-in-canada-by-up-to-9000/) on the Model 3. As of February 1 the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) variant is $59,990 (+$4,000), the Long Range AWD is $68,990 (+$8,000), and the Performance is $$79,990 (+$9,000). That’s also isn’t taking into account the [loss of the $5,000 iZEV rebate](https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/no-more-teslas-eligible-for-izev-rebate-in-canada-after-tesla-increases-model-3-prices/).

Along with the return of the Model 3, Tesla also added the Cybertruck to the referral program in Canada. Since the Cybertruck is one of Tesla’s premium vehicles, it benefits from the larger $1,300 discount, like the Model S and Model X. Tesla referral links work on both [new orders of the regular Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/cybertruck/design?referral=franklin71798&redirect=no) that just launched in Canada, as well as purchases of the [Foundation Series from existing inventory](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/inventory/new?referral=franklin71798&redirect=no).
