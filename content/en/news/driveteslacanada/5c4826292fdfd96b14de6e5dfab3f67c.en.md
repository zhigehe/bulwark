Tesla has officially opened orders for non-Foundation Series Cybertrucks in Canada. At the same time, the company also increased pricing for the remaining Foundation Series units, just days after [increasing prices on all of their other vehicles](https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3/tesla-increases-prices-in-canada-by-up-to-9000/) in Canada.

Non-Foundation Series Cybertruck Now Available in Canada
--------------------------------------------------------

Tesla [first launched the Cybertruck in Canada](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-launches-the-cybertruck-in-canada-starts-at-137990/) late last year, giving Canadians the options to purchase the All-Wheel Drive (AWD) and Cyberbeast for $137,990 or $165,990 respectively. As of today, buyers can purchase the “regular” non-Foundation Series AWD Cybertruck for $114,990 and the Cyberbeast variant for $142,990.

These prices are roughly equivalent to the pricing in the US when you take the exchange rate into account.

According to Tesla’s online configurator, the first deliveries for these models are expected to begin this month.

The biggest difference between the Foundation Series and the regular production Cybertruck is the lack of accessories and goodies. The Foundation Series came with thousands of dollars worth of equipment, like Powershare, Gear Locker Dividers, and more, as well as lifetime Premium Connectivity and Full Self-Driving (FSD). The regular Cybertruck also comes with [Core Wheels and Covers](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybertruck-with-core-wheels-shows-impressive-efficiency-gains/), which are notably smaller than the Foundation Series wheel covers.

**Tesla Increases Foundation Series Pricing in Canada**
-------------------------------------------------------

While new Cybertruck buyers in Canada can now access the standard production models, the Foundation Series has seen a sharp price increase. Tesla has raised the price of the AWD Foundation Series from $137,990 to $153,990, an increase of 11.5%. Meanwhile, the Cyberbeast Foundation Series has jumped from $165,990 to $181,990, a 9.6% hike.

It is a bit of an unconventional price increase, however. Looking closer at the pricing details, the base price of the vehicle has remained unchanged. However Tesla is now charging extra for the 20″ Cyber Wheels (+$5,000) and FSD (+$11,000), both of which were previously included in the price.

This unconventional price adjustment could also a reaction to the value of the Canadian dollar, which has dropped significantly in recent months. When Tesla first launched the Cybertruck in Canada, the US/CAD exchange rate was about $1.35, whereas today is sits at around $1.45.

Don’t forget that Tesla also introduced a new perk over the weekend for Foundation Series buyers in Canada and the US, [offering a free vehicle wrap through XPEL](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offers-free-wrap-to-foundation-series-cybertruck-buyers-in-canada-and-us-lowers-lease-price-in-us/).

**Cybertruck Joins Tesla’s Referral Program in Canada**

Another update for prospective Cybertruck buyers is its addition to Tesla’s [referral program](https://www.tesla.com/referral/paul3921) in Canada. Buyers who use a [referral link](https://www.tesla.com/referral/paul3921) when purchasing a Cybertruck will receive a $1,300 discount. This move is part of Tesla’s broader strategy to encourage word-of-mouth marketing and incentivize new orders through existing owners.
