Tesla has officially confirmed that the new Model Y will feature [matrix headlights](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-matrix-led-headlights-north-america-software-upgrade/). While matrix technology isn’t new to Tesla, the new Model Y will become the first Tesla with adaptive functionality. Lars Moravy, Tesla’s Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, made the announcement on a new episode of Jay Leno’s Garage released on Monday.

While Tesla has been equipping vehicles with matrix LED headlights since 2022, they have remained underutilized in North America due to regulatory hurdles. Tesla has already begun rolling out adaptive high-beam functionality to owners in Europe through software updates, while North American customers have been left waiting for its activation, as Tesla worked through regulatory approvals.

Although Transport Canada approved adaptive headlights back in March 2018, Tesla has yet to enable the feature in Canada, likely to maintain consistency with the U.S. market. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) only granted approval for the technology in 2022, but strict Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 108) in the U.S., which strictly regulate headlight functionality, has slowed Tesla’s release of the feature in North America.

In October 2024, Moravy had stated that [Tesla was “almost there” in securing approval](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-inches-closer-to-releasing-adaptive-headlight-functionality-in-north-america/) for adaptive headlights, with the company working closely alongside regulators to enable the technology. Now, it appears those efforts have paid off, and North American Tesla owners will soon benefit from a more advanced and safer lighting system.

In an interview on Jay Leno’s Garage released on YouTube on Monday, Moravy said the functionality will arrive on the new Model Y “in a couple of months, right after we start delivering, automatic adaptive driving beams, first in the U.S.”

### **What Is The Difference Between Matrix & Adaptive Headlights?**

Matrix headlights use a grid of LED elements that can individually adjust their brightness and direction, allowing for more precise control over how light is distributed. This technology improves nighttime visibility without blinding other other users on the road.

Adaptive headlights take this a step further by dynamically adjusting based on driving conditions, road curvature, and the presence of other vehicles. In practical terms, this means that Tesla drivers will experience better illumination on dark roads while other motorists benefit from reduced glare.

### **Will Other Tesla Models Get Adaptive Headlights?**

The new Model Y is the first Tesla in North America confirmed to receive adaptive headlights, but it hopefully won’t be the only one. As we mentioned, Tesla has already deployed matrix LED headlights on Model S, 3, X, and Y, so now that the NHTSA has given approval, Tesla will hopefully roll out the functionality to existing vehicles that have compatible hardware through an over-the-air (OTA) software update.
