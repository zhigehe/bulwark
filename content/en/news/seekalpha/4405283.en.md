Two major acquisitions—Vantage South End in Charlotte and Sail Tower in Austin—added approximately $1 billion in investments and were immediately accretive to earnings.
* The company's Sun Belt portfolio saw occupancy rise to 89.2%, up from 87.6% at the end of 2023. Connolly emphasized the company’s strategic focus on driving earnings growth while maintaining its best-in-class balance sheet.

### Outlook

* Management released initial 2025 guidance with a midpoint of $2.78 per share in FFO, representing 3.5% growth over 2024. The guidance includes conservative assumptions on major lease renewals and refinancing of a $250 million senior note maturing in mid-2025.
* Colin Connolly stated optimism about market tightening in the lifestyle office sector, with improving fundamentals and declining supply. He projected further occupancy growth, especially as leasing demand accelerates in Sun Belt markets.
* Near-term accretion remains a priority, with the company focused on investing in high-quality lifestyle office properties.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 FFO per share of $0.69 exceeded the midpoint of guidance. Same-property cash NOI increased by 3.4%, driven by occupancy gains and improved parking revenues.
* Leasing activity included 45 office leases totaling 462,000 square feet, with a weighted average lease term of 8.3 years. The company reported average net rent of $35.81 for the quarter.
* Two major acquisitions were completed: Vantage South End in Charlotte for $328.5 million and Sail Tower in Austin for $521.8 million. Both assets were acquired below replacement cost and are expected to provide significant long-term upside.

### Q&A

* Blaine Heck, Wells Fargo: Questioned the competitiveness of the acquisition market and Cousins' ability to sustain accretive investments. Colin Connolly responded, stating that competition remains relatively limited and that Cousins is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities with advantageous cost of capital.
* Jeffrey Spector, Bank of America: Asked about changes to the company’s strategic plan. Connolly emphasized that the strategy remains centered on organic growth, external investments in lifestyle office properties, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
* Michael Lewis, Truist Securities: Inquired about development prospects and market timing. Connolly noted that while no speculative development is planned for 2025, discussions with tenants indicate potential longer-term opportunities.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were slightly positive, expressing optimism about the company’s ability to capitalize on the dislocated private market. However, concerns were raised regarding large pending vacancies, such as the Bank of America lease expiration.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing operational achievements and strategic growth opportunities. Connolly used phrases such as "we are excited about the future for Cousins" and "our team remains strategically focused," indicating high confidence.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was slightly more optimistic, supported by strong leasing and investment activity.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* FFO increased to $0.69 per share in Q4, up from $0.67 in Q3. Same-property NOI growth slowed to 3.4% from 4.4% in the prior quarter.
* Leasing activity declined from 763,000 square feet in Q3 to 462,000 square feet in Q4. However, cash rent roll-ups remained robust at 6.7%.
* Significant acquisitions in Q4, totaling nearly $1 billion, contrasted with smaller-scale investments in Q3.
* Management tone shifted from cautious optimism in Q3 to greater confidence in Q4, citing improving fundamentals and successful transactions.

### Risks and Concerns

* Rising construction costs and limited new supply could constrain development opportunities in the near term.
* Challenges in the private capital market may delay potential acquisitions or disposals.

### Final Takeaway

Management's focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and executing accretive investments positions the company well for continued growth in 2025. However, risks related to lease expirations and market uncertainties remain key factors to monitor.
