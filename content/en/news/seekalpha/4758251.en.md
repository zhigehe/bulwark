| Please see the last page for important GIPS® disclosures.  **Past performance cannot guarantee future results.** Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value. Returns greater than one year are annualized. Returns are expressed in U.S. dollars. All returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.  The gross performance results presented do not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees. Returns will be reduced by such advisory fees and other expenses as described in the individual contract and, where applicable, Form ADV Part 2A.  Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable Managed Account fee (3.00% annually, or 0.25% monthly) from the pure gross or gross composite return. The Managed Account fee includes all charges for trading costs, portfolio management, custody and other administrative fees. Actual fees may vary depending on, among other things, the applicable fee schedule and portfolio size. The fees are available on request and may be found in Form ADV Part 2A. |

Investment environment
----------------------

* Global financial markets performance was mixed in the fourth quarter. In November, Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election sparked a strong U.S. equity market rally, with investors hoping his economic policies would underpin continued U.S. economic growth. However, Trump’s threats to ignite a global trade war pressured non-U.S. equities. Equity markets were broadly weak in December following hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank.

* Fixed income investments declined in both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, as bond yields rose across most sovereign curves.

Portfolio review
----------------

The portfolio held a modest overweight in U.S. equities. While U.S. stocks broadly outperformed international shares in the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s U.S. equity investments were relative detractors. Investments in international equities, where the portfolio was underweight, contributed positively to relative performance.

The portfolio’s equity and fixed income exposures during the period averaged 97.84% and 0.00%, respectively.

Manager outlook
---------------

The global economy remains late cycle, and any incremental risk-taking should be approached with caution. As global monetary policy diverges, and economic broadening impacts sectors in varying degrees, investors should seek to balance a security’s ability to benefit from the cycle’s extension with its valuation.

The U.S. economy’s streak of outperforming other advanced countries looks set to continue. This is not, however, the full-throated, risk-on environment typically associated with the advent of a new cycle.

We remain neutral on Europe, despite signs of steadying economic activity. The region’s central banks were earlier than the Fed in lowering rates, but that was due to necessity. China, on the other hand, could break out of an extended stupor, now that the central government has communicated intentions to deliver meaningful stimulus.

Any shift in U.S. economic policy will undoubtedly reverberate through the corporate sector and financial markets. Deregulatory, corporate tax, and other pro-growth aspects of the incoming administration’s agenda would likely be favorable for riskier assets. However, tariffs and other policy initiatives may present risks to growth.

Although an extension of the cycle should be conducive for riskier assets, valuations are elevated, with most equity segments’ price-to-earnings ratios residing in the top quartile of their long-term average.

Despite the possibility of broadening economic growth, small- and mid-cap stocks are one of the few categories within the U.S. where earnings estimates still have meaningful potential to grow into their valuations. And although broader participation in the equities rally is a welcome development, investors should not lose sight of the Magnificent 7’s continued ability to beat expectations.

The price of fighting inflation was steep for bond investors. But with most of that battle behind us, the new, higher range of bond yields globally has left the asset class in a better position to deliver steady income and diversification to riskier assets.

In the U.S., the Treasuries yield curve reset to higher levels and steepened in the wake of November’s election. Although having already sold off, longer-dated bond yields could face additional pressure if economic growth further surprises to the upside, or trade policies and robust wages prove inflationary.

Corporate credits are richly valued. A candidate for incremental allocation in this space would likely be higher-quality, high-yield issuers, as this category provides more carry and a larger yield cushion. Securitized credits, by contrast, appear more fairly valued and stand to benefit from rising values of their underlying assets.

Outside the U.S., diverging economic fortunes and monetary policy create opportunities. Europe, for example, likely has little choice but to continue its accommodative course, keeping a tailwind for sovereign yields intact.

| **Past performance is no guarantee of future results.** Definitions Monetary Policy refers to the policies of a central bank, aimed at influencing the level of inflation and growth in an economy. It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. A yield curve plots the yields (interest rate) of bonds with equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. Typically bonds with longer maturities have higher yields. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio measures share price compared to earnings per share for a stock or stocks in a portfolio.  To receive a complete list and description of composites and/or a presentation that complies with the requirements of the GIPS® standards, please contact Janus Henderson at 800.668.0434. The opinions are as of 12/31/24, are subject to change and may not reflect the views of others in the organization. Janus Henderson may have a business relationship with certain entities discussed. The comments should not be construed as a recommendation of individual holdings or market sectors, but as an illustration of broader themes.  Global Multi-Asset Aggressive Growth Composite includes multi-asset portfolios that seek total returns through a primary emphasis on growth. Portfolios typically invest in a diversified portfolio of Janus Henderson funds and ETFs as well as external ETFs, normally consisting of approximately 90-100% stocks and 0-10% bonds and money market securities. The composite was created in September 2023.  Information relating to portfolio holdings is based on the representative account in the composite, which reflects the typical portfolio management style of the investment strategy. Other accounts in the strategy may vary due to asset size, client guidelines and other factors.  Portfolio holdings are as of the date indicated, and are subject to change. This material should not be construed as recommendation to buy or sell any security. Holdings are subject to change without notice.  Performance attribution is a method used to analyze and quantify the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its benchmark and does not represent actual performance. Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion. There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met. **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Equity securities** are subject to risks including market risk. Returns will fluctuate in response to issuer, political and economic developments.  **Diversification** neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.  **Foreign securities** are subject to currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility and lower liquidity, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. **Fixed** **income securities** are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa.  **Performance depends on that of the underlying investments.** They are subject to the volatility of the financial markets. Because Janus Henderson Investors US LLC is the adviser to the account and to some or all of the underlying investments, it is subject to certain potential conflicts of interest.  Discussion is based on performance gross of fees and expenses.  **Actively** **managed** **portfolios** may fail to produce the intended results. No investment strategy can ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.
