A TV commercial that the telehealth company Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:[HIMS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS "Hims & Hers Health, Inc.")) is planning to run during the upcoming Super Bowl LIX coverage to promote its compounded weight loss products has drawn lawmaker scrutiny.

Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) sent a letter to the FDA acting Commissioner Sara Brenner on Friday urging the regulator to take enforcement action against what they identified as “deceptive” marketing.

The 60-second advert touting Hims & Hers’ (NYSE:[HIMS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIMS "Hims & Hers Health, Inc.")) compounded weight loss products targeting Novo Nordisk’s ([NVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO "Novo Nordisk A/S")) blockbuster obesity therapy semaglutide has courted controversy since the company posted it on YouTube ahead of its Super Bowl debut.

Pharma lobby group the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) dubbed it as “a misleading ad,” and the public health group the Partnership for Safe Medicines (PSM) called it an “incredibly irresponsible” and “dangerous” commercial.

The commercial, slated to broadcast on Sunday to over 120M Americans watching the Super Bowl, “misleads patients by omitting any safety or side effect information when promoting a specific type of weight loss medication,” the Senators wrote.

“We believe FDA may already have the authority to take enforcement action against marketing that may mislead patients about this company’s products,” they added.

The duo pledged to introduce new legislation to close any regulatory loopholes related to the promotion of compounded drugs that HIMS could be [exploiting in its](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-draw-fda-attention-to-misleading-drug-commercial-set-to-run-during-super-bowl) advertising campaign.
