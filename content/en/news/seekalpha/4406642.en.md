Spirit Airlines (OTC:[SAVEQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAVEQ "Spirit Airlines, Inc.")) has once again rejected Frontier Holdings’ (NASDAQ:[ULCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC "Frontier Group Holdings, Inc.")) offer to merge the two low-cost carriers, stating that Frontier's latest proposal would deliver less in value to the company's stakeholders than contemplated by its ongoing existing reorganization plan.

On Feb. 4, 2025, Frontier submitted a new proposal to Spirit, under which Spirit's stakeholders would receive $400 million in debt and a 19% stake in Frontier following the proposed combination.

The offer was a reiteration of Frontier’s initial proposal, but dropped a requirement that Spirit complete a $350M equity rights offering and use the proceeds to retire its debtor-in-possession facility. It also required a waiver of the bankruptcy court-approved $35M termination fee that would otherwise be owed under the backstop commitment agreement.

Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy in November, said that the new proposal did not address certain material risks and issues previously identified by the company and would result in extended and materially more costly and uncertain chapter 11 proceedings.

On Feb. 7, 2025, Spirit made a counterproposal to Frontier, in which its shareholders would get $600M in debt and $1.185B in equity, which Frontier rejected.

The ultra-low cost airline is now looking to proceed with its standalone recapitalization and conclude the restructuring process in the first quarter of 2025.

Shares of Spirit Airlines (OTC:[SAVEQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAVEQ "Spirit Airlines, Inc.")) are unchanged in premarket trading, while Frontier (NASDAQ:[ULCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC "Frontier Group Holdings, Inc.")) shares are up ~2.26%.
