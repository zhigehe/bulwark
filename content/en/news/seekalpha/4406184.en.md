Phillips 66 (NYSE:[PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) +5.4% in Tuesday's trading after Elliott Investment Management [confirmed a more than $2.5B stake](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19998213-elliott-sends-letter-and-presentation-to-the-board-of-phillips-66 "confirmed a more than $2.5B") in the oil refiner, and will seek to streamline the company, most notably with the sale or spinoff of its midstream business.

The activist investor, which has been pushing for changes at Phillips 66 (NYSE:[PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) in 2023, said in a letter to the company that it is now one of its top five investors and believes the company has failed to follow through on promises to improve operations.

"A streamlined Phillips would include the sale or spinoff of the midstream business," which could attract "a premium valuation in excess of $40B," Elliott said in a letter to the Phillips 66 ([PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) board, adding that it also wants sales of the company's interests in CPChem and the JET retail operations in Germany and Austria.

Phillips 66 ([PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) must commit to ambitious refining targets that reflect best-in-class performance, the activist said, after the company's 2024 refining EBITDA per barrel has trailed top peer Valero ([VLO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VLO "Valero Energy Corporation")) by $3.75/bbl, widening to a $4.75/bbl shortfall in Q4 2024.

Elliott also said the board needs new independent directors to bolster accountability and conduct a review of management.

A Phillips 66 ([PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) spokesperson said the company is "on the right path" and that its 2024 results reflect strong operating performance.
