* CEO Steve Budorick highlighted that 2024 was an exceptional year with FFO per share adjusted for comparability at $2.57, surpassing the midpoint of initial guidance by $0.06, a 6.2% increase over 2023. Same property cash NOI reached a record 9.1% growth, and tenant retention hit 86%, the highest in over two decades. The company committed $212 million to new investments, including building acquisitions in San Antonio and Columbia Gateway.
* Budorick announced 2025 FFO per share guidance of $2.66 at the midpoint, reflecting 3.5% growth and normalized growth of 4.7% net of non-recurring items. He emphasized the positive impact of the new U.S. administration, which he expects will drive defense spending, particularly in space, missile defense, and naval capabilities, areas supported by the company’s portfolio.
* Britt Snider, COO, highlighted a record-high tenant retention rate of 86% in 2024, driven by strong demand for secured mission spaces and investments in skiff spaces. Portfolio occupancy ended the year at 93.6%, with strong leasing activity accounting for 500,000 square feet of vacancies filled in 2024.
* CFO Anthony Mifsud stated, "We reported 2024 FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $2.57," supported by favorable renewal outcomes, lower operating expenses, and tax appeals. He also detailed 2025 FFO guidance in the range of $2.62 to $2.70, with same property cash NOI projected to increase 2.75% at the midpoint.

### Outlook

* Management provided guidance for 2025 with FFO per share expected to grow 3.5% at the midpoint and same property cash NOI projected to increase 2.75%. Occupancy is expected to dip in Q1 due to non-renewals but recover throughout the year, stabilizing between 93.5% and 94.5%.
* Retention for 2025 is forecasted to range between 75% and 85% due to government administrative delays, with management expressing confidence in renewing all government-related inventory.
* The company aims to commit $200 million to $250 million in new investments and maintain a robust development pipeline, including planned data center shells and other defense-related projects.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted FFO per share for Q4 2024 was $0.65, at the midpoint of guidance. Same property cash NOI grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven by increased rents, operational efficiency, and favorable lease renewals.

* Capital investments in 2024 reached $212 million, including acquisitions in San Antonio and Columbia Gateway, which are expected to drive future leasing opportunities.

### Q&A

* Michael Griffin, Citi: Asked if defense budget delays could impact leasing. COO Snider responded that there are "no signs of slowdown" in direct conversations with tenants, highlighting strong demand for military and contractor spaces.
* Blaine Heck, Wells Fargo: Asked about tenant exposure to changes in government workforce strategies. Budorick clarified, "We do not see any of our tenants at risk," emphasizing minimal exposure to GSA leases and strong demand for skiff spaces.
