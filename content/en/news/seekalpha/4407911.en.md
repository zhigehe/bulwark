Pfizer (NYSE:[PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) reported positive results from a Phase 3 study of its drug Talzenna in combination with Xtandi in the treatment of certain patients with prostate cancer.

The study, called TALAPRO-3, showed the combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, or OS, compared to placebo plus Xtandi in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, with or without homologous recombination repair, or HRR, gene mutations, [according to a statement.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001893-pfizer-s-talzenna-in-combination-with-xtandi-improves-survival-outcomes-in-metastatic)

The TALAPRO-2 study consisted of two cohorts, with Cohort 2 evaluating patients selected for HRR gene mutations and Cohort 1 evaluating unselected patients.

After 52.5 months of median follow up, the median OS in cohort 1 was 45.8 months with Talzenna in combination with Xtandi, and 37.0 months with Xtandi and placebo, representing a 20% reduction in the risk of death and a nearly 9-month gain in median OS versus standard of care Xtandi, Pfizer (NYSE:[PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) said.

Pfizer ([PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) added that a 38% reduction in the risk of death was observed in Cohort 2 in patients with HRR-muated mCRPC. At a median follow-up of 44.2 months, the median OS was 45.1 months with Talzenna in combination with Xtandi, and 31.1 months with Xtandi and placebo, representing a 14-month gain in median OS versus standard of care Xtandi.

Data from Cohorts 1 and 2 of the study will be presented Thursday at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco.

Both Talzenna and Xtandi are FDA-approved. Xtandi is co-marketed by Pfizer ([PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) and Astellas ([OTCPK:ALPMF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALPMF "Astellas Pharma Inc.")).
