Earnings Call Insights: Waste Connections (NYSE:[WCN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WCN "Waste Connections, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ron Mittelstaedt highlighted a strong finish to 2024, supported by double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The company completed record acquisition activity totaling $750 million in annualized revenue.
* Core pricing for solid waste was 6.7% in Q4, reflecting strong operational execution and a reduction in employee turnover to below 13%, which has improved operational performance and service quality.

* The decision to close active waste disposal operations at Chiquita Canyon landfill was attributed to economic infeasibility due to regulatory constraints. The company has successfully redirected waste throughput to other landfills.
