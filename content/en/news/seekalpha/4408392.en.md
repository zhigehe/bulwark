Earnings Call Insights: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[ALNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALNY "Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Yvonne Greenstreet highlighted 2024 as a strong year with $1.6 billion in net product revenues, achieving the upper end of the revised guidance. She emphasized the positive results of the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study, regulatory filings for vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy, and the company's transition to profitability with $95 million in non-GAAP operating income. Alnylam anticipates 2025 as a landmark year, focusing on TTR leadership, innovation-driven growth, and sustained profitability.
* Chief Commercial Officer Tolga Tanguler reported 30% year-over-year growth in Q4 for the TTR and rare franchises, with the TTR franchise achieving $343 million in global net product revenues, up 35% from Q4 2023. He noted robust demand for AMVUTTRA and ONPATTRO in the U.S., with a 42% annual growth in TTR sales.
* CFO Jeff Poulton stated, "For the first time, we achieved full-year non-GAAP operating profit of $95 million," driven by product sales growth. He added, "We ended the year with $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities."

### Outlook

* The company provided 2025 guidance for TTR product sales of $1.6 billion to $1.725 billion, representing a 36% growth at the midpoint compared to 2024. This outlook assumes regulatory approval and the U.S. launch of AMVUTTRA for ATTR cardiomyopathy by March 23, 2025, as well as launches in Germany and Japan later in 2025.
* Combined net product revenues for all four commercial products are projected to range from $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion, reflecting 31% growth at the midpoint.
* Collaboration and royalty revenues are expected to reach $650 million to $750 million, supported by a $300 million milestone payment from Roche.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 marked a strong quarter, with $1.646 billion in total product revenues for the full year, driven by 33% growth compared to 2023. TTR and rare franchises grew 34% and 29%, respectively.
* Gross margin on product sales reached 81% for the year, up from 78% in 2023, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs and improved operational efficiencies.
* Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by advancing clinical trials such as KARDIA-3 and nucresiran. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses rose 24%, attributed to pre-launch preparations for AMVUTTRA’s cardiomyopathy indication.
* The company reported a $60 million milestone payment from Novartis for LEQVIO surpassing $600 million in annual sales.

### Q&A

* Tazeen Ahmad, Bank of America: Asked about payer policy timelines post-approval of vutrisiran. CEO Yvonne Greenstreet explained that uptake is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year as formulary approvals progress.
* Kostas Biliouris, BMO Capital Markets: Queried about premium pricing and step edits for AMVUTTRA in commercial insurance patients. Chief Commercial Officer Tolga Tanguler expressed confidence in payer support due to AMVUTTRA’s clinical profile and predictability under Part B.
* Ritu Baral, TD Cowen: Asked about the inclusion of mortality data in vutrisiran’s label. CMO Pushkal Garg noted that the label will likely reflect HELIOS-B’s prespecified endpoints, including mortality and hospitalization benefits.
* Jessica Fye, JPMorgan: Inquired about potential pricing adjustments for AMVUTTRA in cardiomyopathy. Tanguler emphasized the value proposition of AMVUTTRA, highlighting its unique mechanism and affordability for patients.

* Analysts raised concerns about pricing dynamics in a competitive cardiomyopathy market and the potential for payer-imposed restrictions.
* CFO Jeff Poulton highlighted the risk of lower gross margins due to royalty burdens on AMVUTTRA sales, although future developments like nucresiran could offset this pressure.

### Final Takeaway

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals concluded 2024 on a strong footing, achieving profitability and exceeding revenue guidance. The company is poised for significant growth in 2025, driven by the potential approval and launch of AMVUTTRA for ATTR cardiomyopathy.
