### Management View

* Dan Thoren, CEO, highlighted a 7.3% revenue increase year-over-year, driven by strength across end markets, particularly defense, which grew 11%. He emphasized improved gross margins of 24.8%, a 260-basis-point expansion, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.6%, reflecting focus on high-margin opportunities and operational execution.
* Thoren announced a two-phase leadership transition. Matt Malone was named President and COO, with a plan to assume the CEO role in June 2025. Mike Dixon will step into the Vice President role while continuing to lead Barber-Nichols. Thoren expressed confidence in Malone's leadership, citing his success at Barber-Nichols with 9% annual revenue growth.
* CFO Chris Thome noted the company remains debt-free with $30 million in cash and $43 million available on its revolving credit facility, providing flexibility for strategic growth initiatives.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed full-year revenue guidance of $200 million to $210 million, representing 11% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA guidance remains between $18 million and $21 million, reflecting a 47% increase year-over-year.
* Gross margin guidance was raised to 24%-25%, up from the prior range of 23%-24%, supported by better-than-expected results.
* Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are now expected between $15 million and $19 million, up from $13 million to $18 million previously. Investments focus on capacity expansion, including the Batavia manufacturing facility and cryogenic propellant testing facility, both slated for mid-2025 completion.

* **Tony Bancroft, Gabelli Funds:** Asked about exposure to potential supplemental defense budgets. Thoren stated that Graham’s involvement in strategic programs provides visibility and minimizes risks related to budget changes.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts emphasized defense orders and order lumpiness this quarter, whereas last quarter focused on backlog growth and space market opportunities.
* Management’s confidence in hitting fiscal 2027 financial goals remained unchanged, supported by strong cash flow and strategic investments.

### Risks and Concerns

* Supply chain challenges in shipbuilding were flagged, but Thoren assured that customers are prioritizing Graham’s deliveries and exploring additional work opportunities.
* Rising SG&A expenses due to ERP implementation, R&D investments, and acquisition-related costs could pressure margins.
