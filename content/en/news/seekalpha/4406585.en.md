Earnings Call Insights: Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:[UPST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST "Upstart Holdings, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Dave Girouard highlighted a strong quarter with origination volume increasing 33% sequentially and revenue growing 35%, translating to 68% and 56% year-over-year growth in these metrics, respectively. All product categories contributed, with auto and HELOC originations both up 60% sequentially, and small-dollar relief loans showing 115% growth. He emphasized the launch of Model 19, which introduced the Payment Transition Model (PTM), leading to more accurate underwriting.
* Girouard noted significant progress in the HELOC business, with originations exceeding 1,000 loans and no defaults, operating in 36 states covering 60% of the U.S. population. The HELOC expansion included automation improvements and cross-selling strategies.
* CFO Sanjay Datta reported net revenue of $219 million, a 56% year-on-year and 35% sequential increase, driven by 246,000 loan transactions. Fixed costs were managed tightly, with GAAP operating expenses rising only 3% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was $39 million, and GAAP net loss was $2.8 million.
* Datta noted an upsized $1.3 billion commitment from capital partners and a $150 million personal loan warehouse facility, which underscored growing confidence in Upstart’s platform.

### Outlook

* Management expects Q1 2025 revenues of approximately $200 million, including $185 million from fees and $15 million in net interest income. Adjusted EBITDA is projected at $27 million.
* For the full year 2025, the company targets $1 billion in total revenues, $920 million from fees, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. GAAP net income is projected to reach at least breakeven by year-end.
* Girouard outlined four key priorities for 2025: scaling AI model innovation, preparing funding supply for rapid growth, achieving GAAP profitability in the second half, and advancing competitive rates and processes across products.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $0.26 compared to analysts' estimate of (-$0.04). Revenue from fees reached $199 million, exceeding the $181.9 million analysts' estimate.
* Contribution margin stood at 61%, supported by model enhancements and improved borrower acquisition efficiency. Average loan size increased to $8,580 from $8,400 last quarter.
* Net interest income shifted to a positive $20 million, aided by improved credit performance and lower default levels as reflected in the Upstart Macro Index.
* The company ended 2024 with $806 million of loans on the balance sheet, down 28% year-over-year, and $788 million in unrestricted cash, bolstered by convertible debt raises.

### Q&A

* Simon Clinch, Redburn Atlantic: Inquired about borrower demand catalysts. Datta attributed growth to model accuracy improvements, moderating default rates, and previous rate cuts working through platform pricing.
* Reggie Smith, J.P. Morgan: Asked about small-dollar loan volumes. CFO Datta clarified they represent over 15% of loan count but only 3% of origination dollars, reflecting their role in expanding borrower reach.
* Rob Wildhack, Autonomous: Questioned contribution margin resilience amid volume growth. Datta emphasized disciplined take rate management, efficient borrower acquisition, and ongoing cost reductions.
