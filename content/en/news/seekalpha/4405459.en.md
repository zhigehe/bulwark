Gold prices extended their winning run on Monday to hit another record high as U.S. President Donald Trump said he will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, including from Canada and Mexico, as well as other import duties later in the week.

Spot gold ([XAUUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR "Gold Spot Price")) was up +1.39% to $$2,899.11 an ounce, having finished +1.9% higher last week, the metal's sixth consecutive weekly gain and second-highest-ever close amid tariff concerns. Silver ([XAGUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR "Silver Spot Price")) was up +1.49% to $32.270.47.

"Tariff concerns that risk higher inflation and slower economic growth are spurring demand for safe haven assets like gold," ING analysts said.

Gold is up nearly 10% year-to-date, having hit a series of consecutive record highs along the way.

ANZ Research meanwhile noted that the potential of gold also getting caught up in the tit-for-tat tariffs is causing a dislocation in the physical market. "Gold in the Bank of England vault is trading at a discount to the wider market. This has seen weeklong queues to withdraw the metal."

Looking at other metals, the three-month aluminium contract on the London Metal Exchange gained by 0.3% to $2,635 a tonne after Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminium into the U.S. The U.S. imports significant volumes of aluminium and steel from Canada.

Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, the U.S. president said he would announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, matching the tariff rates levied by other countries. “Very simply, it’s: if they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said.

Aluminium stocks gained on Monday following the announcement.

Potentially relevant stocks include: United States Steel ([X](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X "United States Steel Corporation")) +6%, Alcoa ([AA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AA "Alcoa Corporation")) +5%, Nucor ([NUE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUE "Nucor Corporation")) +8.65%, Steel Dynamics ([STLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLD "Steel Dynamics, Inc.")) +7.2%, Cleveland-Cliffs ([CLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLF "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.")) +9.36%, Commercial Metals ([CMC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMC "Commercial Metals Company")) +8.81%, Reliance Steel ([RS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RS "Reliance, Inc.")) +5.9%.
