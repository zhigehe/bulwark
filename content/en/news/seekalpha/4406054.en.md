* Business intelligence and analytics software company Domo (NASDAQ:[DOMO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOMO "Domo, Inc.")) was initiated with an Overweight rating and $11 price target at Cantor Fitzgerald on Tuesday.
* Shares rose 6.5% in premarket trading.
* "We recommend investors consider Domo, an under-followed small-cap data cloud name that is expanding to adjacent areas in AI/ML model management and agentic AI," analysts at the firm wrote. "Domo's pullback of ~30% from a one-year high of over $12, presents what we believe is an attractive entry point, as we view the near-term volatility as temporary in nature and believe it will swiftly recover by executing on reaccelerating growth via a partners' ecosystem strategy or simply selling the company at a premium to the current depressed share price."
* Domo's total addressable market was $57.7B in 2023 and could grow to hit $123B by 2030, the analysts added. If it were to get about 0.4% or 0.5% of the market, it could easily see the 70% upside in the share price and hit the price target, the analysts added.
