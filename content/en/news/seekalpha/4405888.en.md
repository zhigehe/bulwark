Earnings Call Insights: Parks! America ([OTCQB:PRKA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRKA "Parks! America, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* Geoff Gannon, President, highlighted that advertising and sales remain seasonally lower but indicated that these metrics should improve starting in March as the company transitions into its high season. He emphasized that upcoming advertising changes, including new websites and campaigns, are expected to drive improvements.
* Marketing challenges were cited as a significant issue, with a new agency now in place aiming to enhance future performance. Gannon also noted positive developments in the Missouri park, crediting improved management as a key factor.
* Capital expenditures for the Georgia park were significant this quarter, with Gannon revealing that a major restroom project is underway. This project alone is expected to account for at least 50% of Georgia’s fiscal 2025 CapEx.
* Gannon clarified that recent appraisals for the company’s properties, conducted mainly for financing considerations, revealed that the Texas park has the largest gap between its carrying value and appraisal value. He attributed nominal increases in appraised values for Georgia and Missouri to inflation in construction costs.
* On corporate matters, Gannon discussed preparations for a potential reverse stock split, acknowledging its popularity among shareholders but stressing that liquidity priorities would take precedence.

### Outlook

* Gannon projected that advertising spending would return to normal levels starting with the March season, potentially improving sales and attendance.
* He stated that Georgia’s CapEx for the fiscal year will remain elevated due to the restroom project but predicted a substantial reduction in future years.
* Gannon reiterated that decisions regarding the potential sale of the Texas park would likely be made by the end of fiscal 2025, contingent on operational improvements.

### Financial Results

* Advertising expenses and sales remained lower than historical norms due to seasonal factors and ongoing adjustments with a new marketing agency. These conditions were flagged as a temporary issue.
* Missouri was highlighted as showing strong positive momentum, attributed to improved local management, with expectations for continued operational gains.
* Georgia’s capital spending included significant outlays for a restroom project, which Gannon confirmed would not recur in future years. Maintenance-level CapEx for Georgia is expected to be roughly half of the current elevated expenditure levels.

### Q&A

* Ralph Molina noted a question about trends supporting higher revenues in 2025. Geoff Gannon emphasized that marketing improvements, including new campaigns and websites, would be critical drivers of this growth.
* Analyst query on capital expenditures for the Georgia park: Gannon stated that the bathroom project alone could represent 50% or more of CapEx this year, reiterating that this is a one-off expense.
* On liquidity concerns, Gannon confirmed that the company might explore credit facilities as a contingency but stressed a preference for maintaining adequate cash reserves without resorting to borrowing.
* Regarding the reverse stock split, Gannon acknowledged shareholder support but clarified that it would depend on comfortable liquidity levels and cash flow projections.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were focused on marketing effectiveness and capital allocation, with a tone that leaned towards neutral but pressing for specifics on improvements, particularly regarding advertising impacts and liquidity management.
* Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing improvements in Missouri and planned advertising changes. Phrases such as “we are confident” and “we will explore” signaled a measured level of confidence.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone of both analysts and management remained consistent, with analysts maintaining their focus on operational concerns and management reiterating the positive outlook for upcoming seasonal trends.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Advertising challenges were highlighted in both quarters, but Gannon indicated this would be resolved with seasonal increases in activity from March onward.
* Capital expenditures in Georgia were discussed in greater detail this quarter, with the restroom project emerging as a major focus in fiscal 2025 compared to the broader commentary on CapEx in the previous quarter.
* Management sentiment remained consistent, though Gannon provided additional clarity on liquidity priorities and the reverse stock split timeline in this quarter.
* Analysts continued to express interest in Aggieland and Missouri, with more specific questions this quarter about park-level profitability and potential asset sales.

### Risks and Concerns

* Seasonal fluctuations in advertising and sales were cited as a continuing challenge for the business.
* Marketing effectiveness emerged as a key area of concern, with the company acknowledging historical underperformance and outlining steps to address it.
* Liquidity remained a focus, with Gannon emphasizing the importance of maintaining sufficient cash reserves to navigate operational and capital requirements.
* Competition in Georgia was highlighted as a structural issue, with new market entrants impacting attendance.

### Final Takeaway

Parks! America emphasized its focus on seasonal advertising improvements and significant CapEx allocation for Georgia’s restroom project, which is expected to account for at least 50% of this year’s spending. Management remains optimistic about Missouri’s momentum and highlighted the potential for improved profitability with better marketing execution. The reverse stock split remains on the table but is contingent on liquidity priorities, while decisions regarding the potential sale of Aggieland are expected later in the fiscal year.
