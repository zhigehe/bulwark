The latest earnings releases from Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")), Alphabet (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")), and Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) share a common theme: disappointing cloud businesses in a surging market.

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) came under pressure after their recent quarterly earnings releases, following a similar post-earnings drop from Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) last month.

Ahead of their Q4 financials, Alphabet (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) drew investors scrutiny as Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) Q2 FY25 results indicated a lighter growth in its cloud computing business.

A day after its Q2 fiscal 2025 results in late January, MSFT fell ~6% as analysts pointed out that its Azure cloud unit fell short of forecasts even as the company’s top and bottom lines topped [Street forecasts.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4400293-microsoft-gaap-eps-of-3_23-beats-by-0_13-revenue-of-69_6b-beats-by-790m)

This week, Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) confirmed investor worries. Shares of the former fell ~7% after its Q4 2024 results on Wednesday as its Google Cloud business underperformed, delivering $11.96B in revenue, slightly below the $12.19B projected by [analysts, according to Bloomberg data.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403045-key-takeaways-from-alphabet-earnings-after-in-line-revenues)

Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) lost ~4% on Friday following its Q4 print, which indicated that its market-leading cloud platform, AWS, brought in only $28.79B in revenue, falling just behind the $28.84B projected by analysts, [according to StreetAccount data.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404912-amazon-going-all-in-on-ai-and-cloud-platform)

Now that all three leading cloud providers have posted their final quarterly results, how did the overall cloud services market perform in 2024?

According to Synergy Research Group, the global market for cloud infrastructure services reached $91B in Q4, implying ~22% YoY growth. Meanwhile, the full-year cloud market size hit $330B in 2024, mainly driven by generative AI, indicating ~22% YoY growth, accelerating from ~18% YoY growth in 2023.

“Q4 was another strong quarter for cloud services, helping to drive a full-year growth rate that was a full four percentage points higher than 2023,” noted John Dinsdale, a chief analyst at Synergy Research Group. “For [such a big](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-jumped-to-330-billion-in-2024-genai-is-now-driving-half-of-the-growth) market, that is an impressive acceleration of growth,” he added.
