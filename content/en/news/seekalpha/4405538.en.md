* Fortinet (NASDAQ:[FTNT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTNT "Fortinet, Inc.")) was in the spotlight on Monday as investment firm Susquehanna said the company's upcoming firewall refresh should boost optimism, despite uncertainties elsewhere.
* Shares rose 1.2% in premarket trading.
* "FTNT reported a solid [[fourth quarter]](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405062-fortinet-rises-after-solid-q4-improving-refresh-cycle "[fourth quarter]") driven by strength in its hardware business, and management remains optimistic about the growth potential from its upcoming firewall refresh cycle," analyst Shyam Patil wrote in a note to clients. "That said, the company expressed some caution with regards to the outlook due to tariff uncertainty and impacts of a new US administration taking over. While we like the company, its market opportunity, and large looming firewall refresh cycle, the risk/rewards appears balanced at current levels."
* In conjunction, Patil raised his price target on Fortinet to $110 from $90.
