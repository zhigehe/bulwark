The companies that make up the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index this year will collectively increase earnings per share by 11% to $268, strategists at financial-services firm Goldman Sachs forecast on Friday. They said the biggest U.S.-listed companies as a group have demonstrated healthy fundamentals in their year-end earnings reports.

“With 61% of S&P 500 companies accounting for 72% of market cap having reported, S&P 500 aggregate fourth-quarter profits grew by 12% year-over-year, compared with consensus estimates of 8% growth at the start of earnings season,” David Kostin, strategist at Goldman, said in a February 7 report. “The median S&P 500 company grew EPS by a healthy 7% compared with a 6% expectation at the start of reporting season.”

A key risk to the bank’s 2025 forecast is the effect of President Trump’s tariffs on corporate earnings. The U.S. last week imposed tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods, pushing Beijing to retaliate with 10%-15% levies that take effect February 10 on select American goods. Mexico and Canada last week reached separate agreements with President Trump to pause tariffs for 30 days.

“Despite near-term uncertainty, we expect a healthy fundamental outlook will ultimately drive the S&P 500 7% higher to our year-end price target of 6,500,” according to Goldman. The S&P 500 closed at about 6,026 on February 7.

The bank’s forecast for S&P 500 earnings of $268 a share is about 1% less than top-down and bottom-up consensus estimates.

A key difference between this year’s forecast and last year’s results will be the contribution of the so-called Magnificent 7, the technology giants whose values make up a significant part of total market: Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")), Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")), Meta Platforms ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")), according to Goldman.

“The outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has historically reflected its earnings superiority” in relations to the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, Goldman said. “2025 bottom-up estimates imply the excess earnings growth of the Magnificent 7 will narrow from 32 percentage points in 2024 to 6 percentage points in 2025 and 4 percentage points in 2026.”
