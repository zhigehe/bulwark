### Management View

* Embracer Group reported net sales of SEK 12.1 billion and adjusted EBIT of SEK 2.2 billion, driven by strong performance from Asmodee, Middle-Earth Enterprises, and mobile businesses. Free cash flow in the quarter was SEK 1.2 billion, marking the second-highest level in the company’s history.
* CEO Lars Wingefors highlighted progress in restructuring efforts, with CapEx reductions moving towards a target of SEK 5 billion for fiscal year 2024-2025. "We are creating a strong foundation for the future with an improved financial profile," he stated.
* The company reiterated its adjusted EBIT forecast of SEK 7 billion to SEK 9 billion for fiscal 2023/2024, now expecting to reach the low end of the range due to a softer PC/Console segment outlook.
* CFO Johan Ekstrom noted significant CapEx savings, stating, "In December alone, the run rate CapEx decreased to SEK 6.4 billion, a reduction of SEK 1.5 billion compared to the previous year."

### Outlook

* Mobile games achieved SEK 1.6 billion in net sales, with a 37% adjusted EBIT margin supported by strong performance from titles like Alien Invasion. User acquisition costs accounted for 39% of net sales.
* The tabletop segment recorded SEK 4.4 billion in net sales, driven by trading card games and notable inventory reductions, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 19%.
* Entertainment & Services delivered SEK 2.6 billion in net sales, bolstered by licensing revenues from Middle-Earth Enterprises and partner publishing success.
