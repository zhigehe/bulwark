Earnings Call Insights: The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:[TTD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTD "The Trade Desk, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Jeff Green emphasized that 2024 was a record-breaking year, with total spend on the platform exceeding $12 billion and revenue surpassing $2.4 billion, reflecting 26% year-over-year growth. He acknowledged that the company did not meet its internal expectations for the first time in 33 quarters and attributed this to execution missteps.
* Strategic changes included the largest reorganization in the company's history, a focus on operational scalability, and a shift to agile product development teams. Green also highlighted an increased allocation of resources toward brand-direct relationships, which grow 50% faster than the rest of the business.
* Two major announcements included the launch of the Ventura Operating System for Connected Television ([CTV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTV "Innovid Corp.")) and the acquisition of Sincera, aimed at improving the supply chain for the open internet.
* CFO Laura Schenkein highlighted strong growth in CTV and retail media as well as accelerating international expansion. She noted that Q4 revenue reached $741 million, with a 22% year-over-year increase, and adjusted EBITDA was $350 million with a 47% margin.

### Outlook

* Management expects Q1 2025 revenue to be at least $575 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be approximately $145 million.
* CFO Schenkein noted that political ad spend, which contributed approximately 1% to Q1 2024 revenue, will create a tougher comparable for Q1 2025.
* The company anticipates modest deleveraging in 2025 due to increased investments in infrastructure and senior talent recruitment, aligning with recalibration efforts to scale operations.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue was $741 million compared to analysts' estimates of $759.6 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.59 compared to estimates of $0.57.
* For the full year, revenue totaled $2.4 billion, a 26% increase year-over-year, with $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $600 million in free cash flow.
* CTV continued to lead growth, representing a high-40s percentage share of the business with strong international performance. Mobile accounted for a mid-30s percentage, while display and audio made up a smaller share.
* Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, increased 23% year-over-year to $416 million, primarily driven by investments in sales, marketing, and technology.

### Q&A

* Shyam Patil, Susquehanna: Asked about the Q4 shortfall. CEO Green attributed the miss to small execution errors during a period of significant strategic transitions. He emphasized long-term priorities, including structural reorganization, agile product development, and enhanced client engagement.
* Vasily Karasyov, Cannonball Research: Asked about industry-specific challenges in Q4. Green noted that while macro conditions like election-related advertising and GDP pressures influenced some factors, the primary issue was internal execution missteps.
* Youssef Squali, Truist Securities: Inquired about the potential impact of Google exiting the open internet. Green suggested this could leave a large market gap and emphasized The Trade Desk’s readiness to capitalize on such opportunities.
* Mark Mahaney, Evercore: Asked about senior leadership hiring plans. Green highlighted the need for a COO and additional senior leadership to enhance operational efficiency and scalability.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about the Q4 revenue miss, with a pressing tone during Q&A. Green maintained an optimistic yet defensive tone, frequently emphasizing long-term opportunities and the strategic recalibration underway.
* Management tone during prepared remarks was confident but shifted to slightly defensive during analyst questioning, especially regarding execution missteps and Kokai rollout delays compared to expectations.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue growth decelerated to 22% year-over-year in Q4 compared to 27% in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased slightly from 41% in Q3 to 47% in Q4.
* The Q3 call emphasized strong momentum in CTV and retail media, while the Q4 call highlighted recalibration efforts and internal restructuring as key themes.
* Analysts’ focus shifted from celebrating growth rates in Q3 to addressing the Q4 shortfall and seeking clarity on the path to sustained growth.
* Management's tone was more defensive in Q4, in contrast to the confident and optimistic tone in Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Execution risks were highlighted, with management admitting to internal missteps in Q4.
* Analysts expressed concerns about competitive pressures from Amazon and Google, as well as the slower-than-expected Kokai rollout.
* Macroeconomic factors, including political ad spend fluctuations and a potentially polarized advertising environment, were noted as potential headwinds.

### Final Takeaway

Management remains optimistic about long-term opportunities, particularly in CTV, retail media, and international markets. Strategic initiatives, including the adoption of Kokai and enhanced supply chain efficiencies through Sincera, aim to position the company for sustained growth amid a rapidly evolving digital advertising landscape.
