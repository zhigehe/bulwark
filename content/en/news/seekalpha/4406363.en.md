Earnings Call Insights: Stora Enso Oyj ([OTCQX:SEOJF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEOJF "Stora Enso Oyj")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Hans Sohlström, President and CEO, reported a 75% year-on-year growth in adjusted EBIT for 2024, reaching €598 million, driven by improved sourcing, operational efficiency, and cost reductions. Fixed costs were reduced by €110 million, and operating working capital hit an all-time low, decreasing by over €700 million in the last 18 months.
* The company is advancing its strategic growth initiatives, including the ramp-up of the new packaging board line in Oulu, Finland, which is expected to add €800 million in annual revenue upon full capacity in 2027. Additionally, Stora Enso is acquiring Junnikkala, a Finnish sawmill company, to support wood supply and bolster the Wood Products division.
* Reflecting shareholder value focus, the Board proposed a dividend increase to €0.25 per share, up from €0.20 last year.
* CFO Niclas Rosenlew highlighted a reduction in net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio to 3x, with the goal of reaching a target of 2x. "Operating working capital ended at a record low of €544 million," said Rosenlew.

### Outlook

* The company anticipates subdued demand and high wood prices in Q1 2025, with stability in Packaging Materials pricing but continued market volatility in Packaging Solutions due to overcapacity.
* Biomaterials is nearing a cyclical low, with price increases expected to take effect in Q2 2025. Wood Products demand remains low, though slight price increases are projected.
* Wood market demand in the Nordics is expected to remain robust despite decreased pulpwood consumption.
* Stora Enso continues to focus on cost reductions and operational improvements to navigate a challenging economic environment.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 sales increased to €2.3 billion, with adjusted EBIT at €121 million, up 139% from the same quarter last year. This was attributed to higher sales prices and volumes alongside cost-saving measures.
* The Packaging Materials division reported a sales increase to €1.1 billion, supported by higher containerboard prices and volumes, though adjusted EBIT remained negative at €6 million due to market weakness.
* Biomaterials achieved an adjusted EBIT of €67 million, driven by higher sales prices and cost savings, while the Forest division reported strong operational performance with an adjusted EBIT of €81 million.
* Wood Products, despite weak construction activity, saw adjusted EBIT improve to a negative €12 million due to higher volumes and prices.

### Q&A

* Ephrem Ravi, Citigroup: Asked about strategic CapEx plans post-Oulu ramp-up. CEO Sohlström confirmed a pipeline of attractive opportunities, including the potential Langerbrugge newsprint mill conversion to testliner, but clarified no immediate decisions had been made.
* Lars Kjellberg, Stifel: Questioned structural profit improvements and Packaging Solutions' underperformance. CEO Sohlström emphasized ongoing systematic cost efficiency efforts, citing 3,600 improvement actions implemented across the company.
* Andrew Jones, UBS: Inquired about Oulu's EBIT breakeven timeline and U.S. market plans. Sohlström stated no guidance yet on breakeven but highlighted U.S. market readiness with less than 5% of group sales currently originating from the U.S.
* Patrick Mann, Bank of America: Asked about the forest sale and its impact. Sohlström confirmed the 12% sale was representative of Swedish holdings, aimed at debt reduction and exposing asset value.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism over the company's ability to sustain profitability improvements given subdued demand and high wood costs. Questions often focused on structural challenges and market overcapacity, indicating a slightly negative tone.
* Management remained confident, emphasizing systematic improvements and strategic growth initiatives. Statements like "We are confident..." and "We are determined..." highlighted a positive tone during prepared remarks.
* Compared to Q3 2024, management maintained a steady level of confidence, though analysts appeared more pressing in addressing structural issues.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Adjusted EBIT improved from €175 million in Q3 to €121 million in Q4, reflecting challenges in market conditions despite cost-saving actions.
* Strategic focus shifted towards ramping up the Oulu packaging board line and finalizing the forest asset sale, compared to Q3's emphasis on debt ratio improvements.
* Analysts' tone turned more critical, focusing on overcapacity and structural inefficiencies, while management reiterated their commitment to achieving financial targets.

### Risks and Concerns

* Persistent high wood costs and market overcapacity remain significant challenges, particularly in the Packaging Solutions division.
* Analysts raised concerns about the feasibility of ramping up Oulu amid weak demand and potential impacts on profitability.
* Management's mitigation strategies include systematic cost reductions, operational efficiency improvements, and strategic investments in high-margin segments like fiber-based packaging.

### Final Takeaway

Stora Enso's Q4 2024 earnings call highlighted significant profitability improvements despite challenging market conditions. The company's strategic focus on ramping up the Oulu packaging board line and reducing debt signals a strong commitment to long-term growth. However, persistent high wood costs and market overcapacity present ongoing challenges, with analysts pressing management on structural inefficiencies and market dynamics.
