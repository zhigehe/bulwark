### Management View

* CEO Wendy Davidson acknowledged a "disappointing revenue quarter" with a 7% decline in organic net sales but highlighted strong operating cash flow of $25 million and a $12 million net debt reduction. She pointed to sequential improvements in Baby & Kids and Meal Prep categories as well as growth in Greek Gods Yogurt and soup brands.
* Davidson emphasized strategic actions to address supply challenges, improve in-store marketing, and enhance distribution. She stated, "We are confident that these actions...will drive organic net sales growth in the second half."
* Davidson announced a strategic review for the Personal Care business to simplify the company's portfolio and focus on food and beverage categories.
* CFO Lee Boyce reported adjusted EBITDA of $38 million, with a 350 basis point sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA margin to 9.2%. He noted a 60 basis point year-over-year decline in adjusted gross margin, driven by inflation and pricing pressures.

### Outlook

* Boyce stated, "We expect gross margin to expand by at least 90 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow of at least $60 million."
* The company plans to achieve an exit rate of 3%+ organic net sales growth by fiscal 2027 and targets adjusted EBITDA margins of 12%+ by the same period.

### Financial Results

* Free cash flow improved to $25 million from $15 million in the prior year, supported by improvements in accounts receivable and accounts payable.
* Net debt was reduced to $672 million, with a leverage ratio of 4.1x. Management aims to reduce leverage to the high 3s by year-end.

### Q&A

* Michael Lavery, Piper Sandler, probed the timeline for marketing effectiveness in snacks. Davidson noted that promotional activity would yield immediate results, while social media campaigns would build over time.
