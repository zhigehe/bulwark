The deal spread in Capital One's (NYSE:[COF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF "Capital One Financial Corporation")) planned $35 billion acquisition of Discover Financial ([DFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DFS "Discover Financial Services")) widened on Wednesday, amid a report about a potential state lawsuit aimed at blocking the mega transaction. The spread widened to $10.53 from $8.33 on Tuesday.

States including New York and California are considering a lawsuit to block the combination, according to traders, who cited a Capitol Forum report that circulated on Wednesday.

Bloomberg reported in October that New York Attorney General Letitia James was seeking court permission [to issue subpoenas](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4196453-discover-financial-ticks-lower-on-report-capital-one-deal-probed-by-new-york-ag " to issue subpoenas ")  as part of an antitrust review of the deal. James said New York could be especially impacted by the transaction because Capital One (NYSE:[COF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF "Capital One Financial Corporation")) and Discover ([DFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DFS "Discover Financial Services")) have over $9.5 billion and $6.5 billion in credit card loans in the state. 

Shares of Discover ([DFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DFS "Discover Financial Services")) fell 3.2% on Wednesday, while Capital One ([COF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF "Capital One Financial Corporation")) dropped 1.8%.
