Earnings Call Insights: Vanda Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[VNDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNDA "Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Mihael Polymeropoulos highlighted strong revenue growth for Fanapt, driven by its launch for bipolar I disorder and increased new-to-brand prescriptions by over 160% year-over-year. He announced plans to expand the Fanapt sales force to 300 representatives and initiated a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in January 2025 to boost awareness.
* He emphasized the potential of Fanapt’s long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation, which is being evaluated in a Phase III program for schizophrenia relapse prevention and treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency is reviewing a marketing authorization application for Fanapt for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia.
* He detailed the company’s progress on Bysanti (milsaperidone), an active metabolite of Fanapt, with plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) in Q1 2025 for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia, with exclusivity potentially extending into the 2040s.
* Polymeropoulos also discussed the expansion of the PONVORY sales force and its investigational programs in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. He highlighted recent licensing of imsidolimab for generalized pustular psoriasis and plans for a BLA submission in 2025.
* CFO Kevin Moran reported total revenues of $198.8 million for 2024, up 3% compared to 2023, driven by Fanapt and PONVORY growth. He noted a net loss of $18.9 million for 2024, attributed to higher SG&A expenses related to commercial launches.

### Outlook

* Vanda projects 2025 revenues between $210 million and $250 million, representing growth of 6% to 26% compared to 2024. This forecast includes Fanapt, HETLIOZ, and PONVORY but excludes potential contributions from tradipitant or imsidolimab.
* For 2030, Vanda targets psychiatry portfolio revenues exceeding $750 million, supported by approvals for Bysanti in bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, as well as Fanapt LAI. The company anticipates total annual revenue surpassing $1 billion by 2030.

### Financial Results

* Total revenues for Q4 2024 reached $53.2 million, increasing 12% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Fanapt net product sales were $26.6 million, reflecting an 18% year-over-year growth, while HETLIOZ sales declined 5% to $20 million due to generic competition. PONVORY sales increased to $6.5 million from $5.9 million in Q3 2024.
* Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $374.6 million as of December 31, 2024, down $1.6 million from Q3 2024.

### Q&A

* Charles Duncan, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about Fanapt’s sales performance and sales force expansion. CEO Polymeropoulos stated that the growth is largely driven by bipolar disorder prescribers and confirmed plans to expand the sales force further to drive adoption.
* Duncan also inquired about the direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. Polymeropoulos explained that it targets bipolar I disorder patients and has proven effective in raising both patient and prescriber awareness.
* Raghuram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright: Questioned the timeline for Fanapt LAI clinical trials. Polymeropoulos stated that the program could start imminently, with results expected by 2027, depending on recruitment and study duration.
* Selvaraju also asked about the impact of Medicare benefit redesign. Moran noted that the redesign would affect gross-to-net for Medicare products, particularly Fanapt and HETLIOZ, but this was factored into 2025 guidance.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were cautiously optimistic, raising questions about the competitive landscape, sales force expansion, and Medicare reimbursement changes. Their tone was neutral with a focus on execution risks.
* Management displayed confidence in their pipeline and commercial strategies. Polymeropoulos emphasized growth opportunities through product expansion, while Moran highlighted positive revenue trends and disciplined investment.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained consistent, with a continued emphasis on the progress of launches and regulatory milestones.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 increased from Q3’s projections, reflecting stronger confidence in Fanapt and PONVORY launches. The sales force expansion for Fanapt grew from 200 in Q3 to a planned 300.
* Analysts’ focus shifted from initial launch indicators to scaling revenues and pipeline progress. Concerns about Medicare redesign and pricing pressures were more prominent this quarter.
* Management’s confidence in achieving long-term revenue targets for 2030 was a notable addition, signaling a strategic shift toward emphasizing future growth potential.

### Risks and Concerns

* Continued generic competition for HETLIOZ poses risks to revenue stability.
* Medicare benefit redesign is expected to impact gross-to-net margins for Fanapt and HETLIOZ.
* Fanapt LAI’s clinical trial progress may face delays due to IRB objections to placebo-controlled designs.
* Regulatory uncertainties for tradipitant and imsidolimab could impact future product launches and revenue contributions.

### Final Takeaway

Vanda Pharmaceuticals emphasized its strategic focus on expanding its psychiatry portfolio through the launches of Fanapt in bipolar I disorder and the anticipated approvals for Bysanti and Fanapt LAI. The company’s 2025 revenue guidance reflects confidence in scaling its existing products, while its 2030 targets highlight a long-term growth vision. However, generic competition, Medicare reimbursement changes, and clinical trial challenges remain key risks for investors to monitor.
