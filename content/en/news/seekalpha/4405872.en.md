Rapper Kanye West is selling swastika shirts that he promoted in a commercial aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday evening on a platform that e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:[SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")) hosts, according to media reports.

West, who has a clothing and shoe brand called Yeezy, appeared in an ad near the end of the game urging viewers to go to the company’s website. [The Hollywood Reporter said](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/kanye-west-yeezy-commercial-super-bowl-2025-1236131748/) the ad appeared by air in some local markets and not nationally, but it was aired about two hours after the game ended on Fox. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the site on Sunday featured Yeezy products, snippets of songs, CDs and vinyl LPs. However, the report said, the site on Monday only featured a white shirt with a swastika.

Bloomberg reported that the source code and privacy policies for the site showed that Shopify hosted the site.

Last year, Shopify updated its acceptable use policies and removed a language that banned “hateful content.”

Neither Shopify nor West immediately responded to requests for comment by Seeking Alpha.
