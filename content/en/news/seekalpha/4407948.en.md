Earnings Call Insights: Knife River Corporation (NYSE:[KNF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KNF "Knife River Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Brian Gray reported record results for 2024, attributing a 48% two-year growth in adjusted EBITDA to the company’s EDGE strategy. Annual price increases were 7% for aggregates and 10% for ready-mix, while gross margins improved across segments.
* Gray highlighted a $746 million backlog, 13% higher year-over-year, with notable contributions from public infrastructure projects, including a $96 million road construction job in Idaho.
* The company announced its $454 million acquisition of Strata Corporation, which will expand aggregate reserves and add ready-mix and asphalt plants. This acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025.
* CFO Nathan Ring revealed a 7% price increase for aggregates, driving a record gross margin of 21%. He also indicated a planned $500 million debt raise to support the Strata acquisition.

### Outlook

* Knife River provided 2025 guidance for revenue between $3 billion and $3.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA ranging from $485 million to $535 million.
* The company expects volumes for aggregates, ready-mix, and asphalt to rise in the low single digits, with mid-single-digit price increases anticipated.
* Management noted continued momentum in public infrastructure spending, supported by federal and state funding, alongside growing private market opportunities in the latter half of 2025.

### Financial Results

* Record full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were achieved. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew by 360 basis points over two years, with contracting services improving gross margins by 160 basis points.
* The company invested $131 million in acquisitions during 2024, which are projected to contribute $16 million to $20 million to 2025 EBITDA.
* SG&A expenses increased by 5%, reflecting higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses, but were partially offset by asset sale gains.

### Q&A

* Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson: Questioned regional profitability and margin improvements for 2025. CEO Brian Gray emphasized aggregate margin expansion and highlighted the Pacific region’s opportunities in Hawaii, Alaska, and Northern California.
* Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group: Inquired about $20 million in SG&A increases. CFO Nathan Ring explained that the increase supports acquisition programs and EDGE initiatives, including new software and training.
* Trey Grooms, Stephens: Asked about Strata’s market fit. Gray confirmed Strata’s alignment with Knife River’s aggregates-led strategy, noting the acquisition’s expected accretion to margins.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* The Q4 acquisition of Strata Corporation contrasts with Q3’s smaller acquisitions, indicating a strategic shift toward larger, vertically integrated opportunities.
* Analysts in Q4 concentrated more on SG&A increases and acquisition impacts, compared to Q3’s focus on pricing and operational efficiencies.
