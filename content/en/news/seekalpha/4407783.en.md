Lincoln Electric Holdings’ (NASDAQ:[LECO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LECO "Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.")) stock on Thursday jumped as much as 13% to touch a two-month high after the maker of welding equipment reported quarterly results that were better than expected.

The company’s net income was $140.2 million, or $2.47 a share, for the three-month period ended December 31, down from $156.6 million, or $2.70 a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted net income that excluded special items was $146 million, or $2.57 a share, beating the average estimate of $1.99 among Wall Street analysts.

Sales for its Americas Welding segment were $654.8 million, little changed from a year earlier.

“We are pleased with fourth quarter and full year operating profit margin and earnings performance despite challenging industrial sector demand as diligent price/cost management, strong execution of our cost saving actions and operational improvements advanced performance towards our 2025 Higher Standard Strategy goals,” Steven Hedlund, chair, president and chief executive of Lincoln (NASDAQ:[LECO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LECO "Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.")), said in a statement.
