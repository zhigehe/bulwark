### Management View

* CEO Jeff Thiede highlighted that 2024 marked a transformational year for Everus Construction Group, driven by its spinoff from MDU Resources, strong revenue growth, and a significant backlog increase. The company's Q4 revenue grew 20%, supported by balanced growth across commercial, data center, institutional, and utility markets.
* The company reported a 38% year-over-year increase in backlog, reaching $2.8 billion, providing strong visibility into 2025 growth. Thiede emphasized that the backlog reflects deep customer relationships and favorable demand trends.
* Everus introduced its 2025 guidance, projecting revenue between $3 billion and $3.1 billion and EBITDA in the range of $210 million to $225 million. Thiede noted the company's strong financial flexibility, with net leverage at 1 times, well below its target range.
* CFO Max Marcy provided additional details on Q4 performance. He noted that revenue reached $760 million, with Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) revenues increasing 21%, and Transmission and Distribution (T&D) revenues growing 15%. EBITDA for the quarter was $58 million, impacted by $6.3 million in public company stand-up costs.

### Outlook

* Everus expects 2025 revenue in the range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion, reflecting strong end-market demand and a healthy backlog. EBITDA is projected between $210 million and $225 million, with $65 million to $70 million allocated for capital expenditures.
* Management noted a slightly longer backlog conversion cycle due to larger, more complex projects, but emphasized that this offers greater visibility into future growth.
* Strategic M&A is a priority for 2025, with a focus on geographic expansion and strengthening both E&M and T&D segments. Thiede mentioned that M&A efforts would target companies with strong leadership and safety cultures.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter revenue increased 19.5% year-over-year to $760 million, driven by growth in E&M and T&D segments. E&M revenue was $550 million, supported by data center and institutional markets, while T&D revenue reached $213.3 million, led by storm, underground, and substation sub-markets.
* Full-year revenue for 2024 was $2.85 billion, in line with the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $232 million, up from $223 million in 2023, despite $6.3 million in public company costs. EBITDA margin for 2024 was 8.1%, a 30-basis-point improvement from the prior year.
