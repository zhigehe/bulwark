Cosmo Pharmaceuticals N.V. ([OTCPK:CMOPF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMOPF "Cosmo Pharmaceuticals N.V.")) Monday said that Glenmark had received approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to market Winlevi in the United Kingdom.

Winlevi is the first topical acne treatment in nearly 40 years with a first-in-class mechanism of action, [the company said.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996183-cosmo-and-glenmark-announces-uk-mhra-approval-of-winlevi-r-for-treatment-of-acne "the company said.")

“Its active ingredient, clascoterone, is the first commercially available topical androgen receptor inhibitor, targeting androgen receptors in sebaceous glands with no systemic anti-androgen effects, and as such it can be used safely in both males and females.”

As part of the agreement signed in September 2023, Glenmark has in-licensed the product from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals for distribution in Europe and South Africa.
