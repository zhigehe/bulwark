European companies will not become “an inch” more competitive unless the European Union simplifies environmental regulations that have placed a burden on businesses that are "disproportionate" to any environmental benefits, Siemens Energy ([OTCPK:SMEGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMEGF "Siemens Energy AG")) ([OTCPK:SMNEY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMNEY "Siemens Energy AG")) CEO Christian Bruch [warned](https://www.ft.com/content/98241f9c-7b98-4267-b073-2a2c57a3a548 "warned") Wednesday, according to the *Financial Times*.

"Just making cosmetic changes to regulations will not move us one inch closer to becoming more competitive,” Bruch said, singling out the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, a rule the EU introduced in 2023 requiring companies to detail their environmental and social impact.

The directive has created more than 1,000 data points that must be reported to EU headquarters in Brussels, the CEO said, adding that it needed to be "radically shortened and simplified."

A backlash against EU regulations covering the environmental, social and governance impact of companies has gained momentum since the election victory of Donald Trump, who has pledged to roll back regulations on U.S. companies.

In a sign of growing pressure, the EU has said it will review environmental reporting requirements on companies, including the CSRD, as part of a wider effort to reduce red tape.

Bruch comments came as Siemens Energy ([OTCPK:SMEGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMEGF "Siemens Energy AG")) ([OTCPK:SMNEY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMNEY "Siemens Energy AG")) [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406607-siemens-energy-ag-gaap-eps-of-023-revenue-of-89b-updates-fy25-outlook "reported") a €252M (~$261M) net profit in the quarter ended December 31, compared with €1.58B booked in the year-earlier quarter, while revenues rose to €8.94B from €7.65B, despite a 10% Y/Y decline in orders that was expected following exceptionally high orders in year-ago period.
