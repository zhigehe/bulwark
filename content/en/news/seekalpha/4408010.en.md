Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:[ARM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARM "Arm Holdings plc")) has reportedly signed Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:[META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) as the first customer for its own chip, the Financial Times reported.

Arm shares rose nearly 6%, while Meta shares fell 0.3% in midday trading.

Based in the U.K. and led by Chief Executive Rene Haas, Arm is likely to announce its own chip, believed to be a central processing unit, as soon as the summer, the news outlet [added](https://www.ft.com/content/95367b2b-2aa7-4a06-bdd3-0463c9bad008 "added"), citing people familiar with the matter.

Arm had been discussing building its own chip and [previous reports](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4394659-arm-said-to-hike-prices-as-much-as-300-consider-making-own-chips-report "previous reports") indicated that it could acquire privately-held Ampere Computing to further boost its efforts to do so. The Times added that Arm is getting closer to acquiring Ampere, which is backed by Oracle ([ORCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL "Oracle Corporation")).

Upon launch, it would place Arm, which is still majority owned by SoftBank ([OTCPK:SFTBY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY "SoftBank Group Corp.")), further in competition with some of its largest customers, including Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), whom use Arm's intellectual property for their own custom chips. Nvidia dominates the AI accelerator market, with estimates suggesting it has at least 70% of the market, thanks to its GPUs, including the Hopper and Blackwell lines.

AMD ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) also has its own AI accelerator offerings, including the [recently launched](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4395675-amd-downgraded-at-wolfe-research-as-firm-expects-slower-gpu-revenue-growth "recently launched") MI325, which was a slight upgrade over its MI300 offering.

Haas and SoftBank co-founder Masayoshi Son have been instrumental in pushing Arm to further diversify its revenue streams and move towards making its own processors.

Arm, SoftBank, Meta and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.
