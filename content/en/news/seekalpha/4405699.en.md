Illumina (NASDAQ:[ILMN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ILMN "Illumina, Inc.")) has been cut to underweight from equal weight by Barclays over concerns the company may be facing sanctions in China and risks to its 2025 and long-range guidance.

"Given our ratings are relative to our universe, we struggle to see how shares would perform with the rest of the group over the rest of the year," Barclays said in a note.

In addition to China, Barclays also cited increasing competition from Roche in the clinical market and "the lack of elasticity seen in the business as highlighted by the soft 4Q consumables."

Barclays lowered its price target for the stock to $100 from $130.
