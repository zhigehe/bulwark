Adding on to its over 37% decline over the past 12 months, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:[AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) fell another ~7% this week after the semiconductor giant released its latest quarterly results on Tuesday.

While AMD's adjusted Q4 2024 earnings per share, improving ~42% YoY to $1.10 per share, stood in line with the Street’s forecasts, its revenue for the quarter, which reached $7.7B with ~24% YoY growth, and its revenue outlook for the current quarter exceeded expectations.

With AMD trading at a sharp discount to its five-year average forward P/E ratio, many Seeking Alpha authors reviewed their positions on the company after what appeared to be [a mixed performance in Q4.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403178-amd-reports-record-q4-revenue-continues-to-gain-market-share)

The Bulls
---------

“AMD did not deliver a double beat, which would have been ideal, but it still delivered quite positive results,” wrote Seeking Alpha Investing Group Leader [Jonathan Weber](https://seekingalpha.com/author/jonathan-weber) in *[“AMD: Use This Buying Opportunity As The Market Overreacts.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754852-amd-use-this-buying-opportunity-as-the-market-overreacts)*  “From a growth-to-valuation perspective, AMD seems quite attractive to me right here, with shares now trading at a 52-week low despite ongoing operational success.”

“AMD's Q4 results show strong growth, with a 69% YoY increase in data center revenue and stable client segment performance,” added SA Investing Group Leader [Oakoff Investments](https://seekingalpha.com/author/oakoff-investments) in *[“AMD: The Market Likely Got It Wrong.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755013-amd-the-market-likely-got-it-wrong)*  “AMD has now got an even bigger upside after the Q4 print. My calculations point to a price of $148.5/share by the end of this year (+36%).”

“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. delivered record Q4 revenues and EPS, but the AMD stock dropped due to disappointing Data Center revenue and cautious Q1 guidance,” opined SA Investing Group Leader [James Foord](https://seekingalpha.com/author/james-foord) in *[“AMD Q4: The Next Nvidia Or The Next Intel?”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755082-amd-q4-next-nvidia-or-the-next-intel)* “With a compelling valuation and technical set-up, AMD stock could double in 2025.”

“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s Q4 results disappointed Wall Street, but revenue grew 14% YoY, and strong long-term fundamentals remain intact despite short-term volatility,” SA analyst [Oliver Rodzianko](https://seekingalpha.com/author/oliver-rodzianko) in *[“AMD Stock: Outsmart The Market And Buy The Post-Q4 Dip.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755653-amd-stock-outsmart-the-market-and-buy-the-post-q4-dip)* “With a projected 36.5% three-year CAGR and undervaluation, AMD is a Strong Buy for long-term investors despite near-term technical weakness.”

“Despite the selloff, I think AMD's strong data center sales and dominant consumer offerings have the stock positioned for a potentially lucrative 2025,” noted SA analyst [Kumquat Research](https://seekingalpha.com/author/kumquat-research) in *[“AMD Earnings: Why It's Selling Off And Why I'm Doubling Down.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755751-amd-earnings-why-its-selling-off-and-why-im-doubling-down)* “With a low valuation relative to peers, AMD shares appear cheap.”

The Bears
---------

“Some drivers for the selloff include a slowdown in data center revenue growth, weak Q1 2025 guidance, and stagnation in non-GAAP gross margins,” wrote SA analyst [Deep Value Investing](https://seekingalpha.com/author/deep-value-investing) in *[“AMD: A Cooldown To $100 Might Be Coming.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755109-amd-a-cooldown-to-100-might-be-coming)* “If a strong bounce occurs, I would consider buying on the next pullback. Until then, this stock is a sell.”

“We urge investors not to mistake the post-earnings sell-off as a buying opportunity, as we think AMD stock price still has more downside to price in before hitting attractive levels,” added SA Investing Group Leader [Tech Stock Pros](https://seekingalpha.com/author/tech-stock-pros) in *[“AMD: Don't Mistake This As A Buying Opportunity - Reiterate Sell.”](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756045-amd-dont-mistake-this-as-buying-opportunity-reiterate-sell)* “We believe investors could very well see AMD break into new 52-week-low levels and hence recommend exiting the stock.”
