Roblox (NYSE:[RBLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBLX "Roblox Corporation")) is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, *Bloomberg* reported Friday, citing information obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation,” SEC told *Bloomberg*.

It was not immediately clear what the subject matter of the investigation was. In recent days, concerns over children's safety on the company's platform were raised.

*Bloomberg* reported in July that at least two dozen people were arrested by police in the U.S. since 2018, accused of abusing or abducting victims they’d met or groomed using Roblox.

The online gaming platform reported its fourth quarter results on Thursday. It forecast a wider loss for 2025 and missed expectations for bookings and daily active users for Q4. The stock closed down 11% yesterday.
