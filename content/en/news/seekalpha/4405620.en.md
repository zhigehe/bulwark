Pliant Therapeutics (NASDAQ:[PLRX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLRX "Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.")) stock plunged 61% in the wake of news that it has paused enrollment in a Phase 2b study of its drug bexotegrast in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Pliant paused the study on the recommendation of the study's independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB. Patients currently enrolled in the study, called BEACON-IPF, will remain in the trial.

"Enrollment and dosing have been paused while data is reviewed to understand the DSMBâ€™s rationale for their recommendation. Blinding of the study will be maintained to preserve trial integrity," Pliant said [in a statement released late Friday.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995937-pliant-therapeutics-provides-update-on-beacon-ipf-a-phase-2b-3-trial-in-patients-with)

On Saturday, Wells Fargo cut its rating on the stock to equal weight from overweight, citing uncertainty about the drug's path forward. It dropped its probability of success to 10% and slashed its price target to $4 from $41.

Citi likewise downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, citing the study pause. The bank cut its price target to $4 from $40.
