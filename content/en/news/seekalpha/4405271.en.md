Earnings Call Insights: CleanSpark (NASDAQ:[CLSK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLSK "CleanSpark, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Zach Bradford highlighted CleanSpark's strategic positioning as the largest publicly traded pure-play Bitcoin miner, emphasizing the company's operational leverage and margins as it scales to 50 exahash by mid-2025. He noted that the company's Q1 milestone of 39.1 exahash exceeded expectations and reiterated plans to achieve the 50 exahash target through greenfield construction and expansions in Georgia, Wyoming, and Tennessee.
* A $650 million convertible bond secured during the quarter was used to fund growth and a share buyback, ensuring that the path to 50 exahash will not rely on equity issuance. Bradford emphasized that this funding strategy aligns with CleanSpark’s long-term operational efficiency goals.
* CFO Gary Vecchiarelli reported that Q1 revenues grew 120% year-over-year to $162.3 million, driven by higher Bitcoin prices and increased production efficiency. Fleet efficiency improved to 17.59 joules per terahash, with further gains expected in the coming weeks.
* Vecchiarelli stated, "Our cost to mine a Bitcoin decreased to approximately $34,000," representing a $2,000 improvement compared to the prior quarter.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its plans to achieve 50 exahash by mid-2025, with greenfield development and site expansions already underway. The company also holds an option to scale beyond 60 exahash at competitive costs.
* Bradford stated that the infrastructure necessary to reach 50 exahash is already secured, including advanced S21 XT immersion units and other components. He noted that the company’s strategy focuses on maximizing efficiency and immediate productivity.
* CleanSpark remains open to acquisitions but emphasized disciplined evaluations, particularly for opportunities involving less efficient fleets or small-scale sites with capital constraints.

### Financial Results

* CleanSpark reported Q1 revenues of $162.3 million, up 120% year-over-year, and net income of $246.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA reached $321.6 million, marking a new industry benchmark.
* Bitcoin production increased 33% quarter-over-quarter, with the average price per Bitcoin exceeding $83,000 during the quarter. The company ended Q1 with 9,952 Bitcoin in its treasury, which has since grown to 10,556 as of January 31.
* Gross profit margins improved significantly, with the cost to mine a Bitcoin decreasing to $34,000, reflecting increased fleet efficiency and operational execution.

### Q&A

* Mike Colonnese, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about Bitcoin treasury management strategies. CFO Vecchiarelli responded, "We are in the process of gathering RFPs... but ultimately, we’re not going to leverage 100% of the balance immediately."
* Brett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald: Inquired about managing operating expenses while growing hash rate. Vecchiarelli explained, "Every exahash that comes online almost drops to the bottom line because we don’t need incremental corporate overhead to support additional revenue."
* Tyler DiMatteo, BTIG: Asked about scaling challenges from 40 to 50 exahash. Bradford emphasized, "Everything we’ve done is to basically build a blueprint that can be stamped out on a repeat basis."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were generally positive, focusing on CleanSpark’s growth trajectory and operational efficiency. Questions revolved around treasury management, capital allocation, and scaling challenges, reflecting optimism with a cautious interest in execution details.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing operational milestones, strategic funding, and disciplined growth. Bradford’s repeated emphasis on "repeatability" and "efficiency" reflected confidence in scaling plans.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was more confident, driven by exceeding hash rate targets and strong financial performance. Analysts remained inquisitive but less skeptical than before.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* CleanSpark’s Q1 revenue of $162.3 million represented significant sequential growth from the $89.1 million reported in Q4 2024, aided by higher Bitcoin prices and increased production.
* Fleet efficiency improved from 21.94 joules per terahash to 17.59 joules per terahash, and the cost to mine a Bitcoin decreased by $2,250 quarter-over-quarter.
* Management's tone shifted from cautious optimism in Q4 to confident execution in Q1, driven by achieving and surpassing operational targets.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted potential challenges from rising energy costs but stated that their diversified energy strategy mitigates this risk. Vecchiarelli noted, "We do not manage the business to a price per kilowatt hour, but rather to margin and profitability on a per coin basis."
* Analysts expressed interest in CleanSpark’s ability to manage scaling efficiently without overextending its balance sheet. Management reaffirmed its disciplined approach to capital allocation.

### Final Takeaway

CleanSpark delivered a strong Q1 performance, marked by 120% revenue growth and a significant increase in hash rate and fleet efficiency. With funding secured and infrastructure in place, the company is well-positioned to achieve its 50 exahash target by mid-2025.
