Earnings Call Insights: Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:[PBI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBI "Pitney Bowes Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Lance Rosenzweig highlighted 2024 as a transformative year for Pitney Bowes, emphasizing progress on four strategic initiatives: exiting the Global Ecommerce (GEC) segment, cutting costs, unlocking cash, and deleveraging the balance sheet. He described the company as "more efficient and focused" with a strong foundation for sustainable value creation.
* The company exited the GEC segment with $165 million in one-time costs, offset by a $164 million tax asset expected to reduce cash taxes over three years.
* $120 million in annualized cost savings were achieved in 2024, with a new target of $170 million to $190 million in net annualized savings to be realized through 2025 and 2026. Savings will come from overhead reductions, IT simplification, vendor spend cuts, and facility consolidation.
* Bob Gold will join as CFO in March 2025, bringing expertise in capital allocation, cost containment, and debt management. Interim CFO John Witek will retire at quarter's end.
* Pitney Bowes plans to return capital to shareholders, including a dividend increase and a $150 million share repurchase authorization over the next three years.
* CFO John Witek reported Q4 revenue of $516 million and adjusted EBIT of $114 million, a 33% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was $0.32, driven by higher EBIT.

### Outlook

* Management expects 2025 revenue to range between $1.95 billion and $2 billion, reflecting a modest decline due to headwinds in SendTech from product migration, partially offset by growth in Presort and shipping-related revenues.
* Adjusted EBIT guidance for 2025 is set between $450 million and $480 million, driven by cost savings and growth in Presort and shipping.
* Adjusted EPS for 2025 is forecasted between $1.10 and $1.30, with a tax rate of 27% to 31%. Free cash flow is projected between $330 million and $370 million.

* Presort revenue grew 10% in Q4 to $180 million, with adjusted EBIT increasing 52%, driven by higher revenue per piece and cost reductions. Full-year Presort adjusted EBIT rose 49% to $166 million.
