Tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) and Google ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) have removed up to 20 apps from their app stores after security experts at Kaspersky found that they were carrying malware for almost a year, according to a report from *TechCrunch*.

The malware "SparkCat" has been active since March 2024, according to security experts at Kaspersky. The report said they had initially found the malicious framework within a food delivery app in the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia but later found the malware on 19 other apps, which were downloaded over 242,000 times from Google's Play Store.

The malware used optical character recognition and could scan photos saved in the gallery app on devices for keywords to find recovery phrases for cryptocurrency wallets in various languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the report said. The malware could also extract personal information like messages and passwords from screenshots.

The report said Apple pulled the compromised apps from the App Store last week upon receiving the report from Kaspersky researchers, and Google followed suit.

"All of the identified apps have been removed from Google Play, and the developers have been banned," a Google spokesperson told *TechCrunch*. The spokesperson also said Android users "were protected from known versions of the malware through the in-built Google Play Protect security feature."

A Kaspersky spokesperson told *TechCrunch* that while the reported apps were removed from the official app stores, the company's telemetry data suggested that the malware was also available from other websites and non-official app stores.
