Earnings Call Insights: AtriCure, Inc. (NASDAQ:[ATRC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATRC "AtriCure, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Michael Carrel emphasized that 2024 was a year of "continued growth," highlighted by achieving $465 million in revenue, representing a 17% increase. Key drivers included robust performances in pain management, open appendage management, and open ablation franchises.
* The company reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance of $517 million to $527 million, targeting an adjusted EBITDA range of $42 million to $44 million, representing nearly 40% growth over 2024.
* The pain management franchise grew 32% worldwide in 2024, supported by the launches of CryoSPHERE+ and CryoSPHERE MAX probes, which reduced procedure times by up to 50%. These launches added 100 new accounts globally and engaged over 800 customers.
* Expansion efforts included the launch of EnCompass Clamp in Europe and an FDA-approved clinical trial (BoxX-NoAF) to study prophylactic ablation for reducing postoperative AFib.
* CFO Angela Wirick noted Q4 revenue of $124.3 million, a 16.6% increase year-over-year. She highlighted a 74.5% gross margin for Q4, with R&D expenses up 68% due to a $12 million payment tied to PFA technology licensing.

### Outlook

* AtriCure projects revenue growth of 11%-13% for 2025, supported by new product launches and international expansion.
* Pain management, open appendage management, and open ablation are expected to lead 2025 performance, while minimally invasive ablation and MIS appendage management are anticipated to face continued pressure.
* International growth is expected to outpace U.S. growth in 2025 due to lower overall penetration and strong momentum in global markets.
* Management anticipates flat gross margins in 2025, with operational scale and cost-saving initiatives offsetting rising material costs. R&D expenses will remain at approximately 20% of revenue, including up to $10 million in milestone payments for PFA platform development.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted loss per share for Q4 2024 was (-$0.08), compared to (-$0.21) in Q4 2023. Full-year adjusted loss per share was (-$0.67), improved from (-$0.75) in 2023.
* Full-year adjusted EBITDA reached $31.1 million, up from $19.4 million in 2023.
* International revenue grew 27.7% in Q4, driven by strength in minimally invasive ablation and appendage management franchises. Pain management sales showed significant growth in the U.S. and Europe.
* Gross margin for the full year stood at 74.7%, a slight decline due to unfavorable product and geographic mix.

### Q&A

* Lily Lozada, JPMorgan, asked about the growth trajectory for EnCompass. CEO Carrel clarified that growth is now driven by net new users and expanded use cases, with little cannibalization from legacy products.
* William Plovanic, Canaccord, inquired about the cryoSPHERE MAX and FLEX-Mini launches. CEO Carrel noted "early innings" for both products, highlighting better-than-expected adoption.
* Matthew O'Brien, Piper Sandler, questioned the adjusted EBITDA guidance increase. CFO Wirick attributed it to efficiencies and stronger-than-expected bottom-line performance in 2024.
* Mike Matson, Needham, inquired about the regulatory pathway for PFA products. CEO Carrel confirmed a likely PMA process and integration of PFA technology into open clamps and minimally invasive devices.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts displayed a neutral-to-positive tone, acknowledging strong growth but raising concerns about headwinds in the minimally invasive segment. Questions focused on sustainability of growth and the impact of new products.
