### Management View

* CEO Sam Choi highlighted a 30% revenue increase in Q3 2025 and noted ongoing challenges from geopolitical disruptions at Israel’s Haifa Port, delaying $6 million worth of shipments to Q4. Choi emphasized the company’s focus on diversifying its customer base and expanding production capabilities, with facilities expected to grow capacity by 15% by June 2025 and an additional 5%-10% by the end of 2025.
* Eric Tang, Executive Director, reported improved logistics conditions by late January 2025, with factories fully booked through August. Tang expressed optimism about increasing inquiries from global apparel brands, particularly in Europe and the Persian Gulf region, driven by Jordan’s tariff-free trade advantages. He also shared plans for a long-term expansion, including engineering studies for larger facilities.
* CFO Gilbert Lee stated, "Revenue for our fiscal 2025 third quarter increased 28.6% to $35.4 million from $27.5 million for the same quarter last year," while gross profit rose 20.6% to $5.4 million. Higher logistics costs due to geopolitical turmoil impacted gross margins, which declined from 16.2% to 15.2%.

### Outlook

* Management projected Q4 2025 revenue growth of 50%-53% year-over-year, supported by delayed Q3 shipments being accounted for in the current quarter. Revenue for Q1 2026 is expected to align with Q1 2025, which included $3-$4 million in delayed shipments from FY2024.
* Gross margins for Q4 2025 are anticipated to stabilize at 15%-16%, subject to logistics costs and product mix.
* Plans for long-term capacity expansion, including a facility in Al-Hasa, are expected to enhance production by another 5%-10% by the end of 2025.
