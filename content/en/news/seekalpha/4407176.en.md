Southern Copper (NYSE:[SCCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCCO "Southern Copper Corporation")) +2.2% in Wednesday's trading after reporting [Q4 results](https://southerncoppercorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/pr250211.pdf "Q4 results") and saying it will [move ahead](https://www.mining.com/southern-copper-eyes-2027-start-for-1-8b-tia-maria-mine/ "move ahead") with its long-delayed Tia Maria copper mine in Peru, aiming to start production in 2027 while raising the project's capital budget to $1.8B from an earlier projection of $1.4B.

Tia Maria has faced years of delays due to strong local opposition over environmental concerns; the Peruvian government approved the mine in 2019 after a long suspension, and Southern Copper (NYSE:[SCCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCCO "Southern Copper Corporation")) resumed development last year, now expecting to break ground in H1 2025.

Once operational, Southern Copper ([SCCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCCO "Southern Copper Corporation")) said Tia Maria is expected to produce 120K metric tons/year of copper.

At current copper prices, the mine should export $17.5B and contribute $3.4B in taxes and royalties during the first 20 years of operation, Southern Copper ([SCCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCCO "Southern Copper Corporation")) said in its Q4 earnings report, which included quarterly net income of $793.9M and net sales of $2.78B, up 78% and 21% Y/Y, fueled by higher sales volumes for copper, zinc and silver and better prices for all the company's main products.

For 2025, the company said it expects to maintain the current activity level in copper by producing 967K tons, in line with 2024 levels, while also producing 171.7K tons of zinc, up 32%; 23M oz of silver, up 10%; and 26.2K tons of molybdenum, down 10%.
