Earnings Call Insights: Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:[INSP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INSP "Inspire Medical Systems, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Tim Herbert highlighted milestones in 2024, including surpassing 90,000 patients treated with Inspire therapy, FDA approval of the Inspire V neurostimulator, and achieving full-body MRI compatibility in the European Union. The company’s first full year of profitability was also noted, with key leadership changes aimed at future growth.
* Inspire V, the newly approved neurostimulator, eliminates the need for a pressure sensing lead, reducing surgical times and production costs. A limited U.S. launch is underway, with a full launch anticipated later in 2025, contingent on inventory buildup.
* CFO Rick Buchholz reported Q4 revenue of $239.7 million, representing a 25% increase year-over-year. U.S. revenue grew 22%, while international revenue surged 163%, driven by growth in several European markets.
* The gross margin for Q4 was reported at 85%, with operating expenses increasing 11% year-over-year, primarily due to sales expansion and corporate costs.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed 2025 revenue guidance of $940 million to $955 million, equating to 17%-19% growth year-over-year. Gross margins are expected to remain between 84%-86%.
* Diluted net income per share for 2025 is projected to range from $2.10 to $2.20, supported by ongoing profitability improvements.
* The Inspire V launch is expected to contribute to future growth, with a focus on scaling production and expanding its adoption across U.S. centers.

### Financial Results

* Q4 net income was $35.2 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to $14.8 million, or $0.49 per share, in Q4 2023. The company’s full-year EPS for 2024 was $1.75, a significant improvement from the previous year’s loss of $0.72 per share.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $62.7 million, reflecting a 26% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 17% in the same period last year.
* Operating cash flow for the full year was $130 million, ending 2024 with $517 million in cash and investments.

### Q&A

* Travis Steed, Bank of America Securities: Asked about EPS guidance and seasonality. CFO Buchholz explained that profitability improvements are expected sequentially after Q1, reflecting traditional revenue seasonality.
* Danielle Antalffy, UBS: Inquired about the impact of digital scheduling on patient volumes. CEO Herbert noted that centers using digital scheduling have shown streamlined appointment processes and improved efficiency.
* Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan: Asked about Inspire V rollout and revenue phasing. CFO Buchholz stated that sequential revenue growth is expected throughout the year, with investments continuing in R&D and sales expansion.
* Richard Newitter, Truist Securities: Questioned the Inspire V coding strategy and the transition to a new CPT code. CEO Herbert emphasized that while surgical time is reduced, physician reimbursement remains consistent on a time-adjusted basis.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised questions about Inspire V’s launch timing, DOJ investigation, and 2025 guidance. The tone was neutral to slightly positive, reflecting confidence in the company’s growth outlook but cautious interest in regulatory and operational risks.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, particularly regarding profitability, Inspire V’s potential, and international market expansion. During Q&A, their tone was slightly defensive when addressing the DOJ investigation and Inspire V inventory buildup.

### Risks and Concerns
