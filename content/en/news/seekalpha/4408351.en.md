Earnings Call Insights: Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:[RWT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RWT "Redwood Trust, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Christopher Abate highlighted progress in 2024 with a 5.7% total economic return despite significant treasury yield volatility. He emphasized the company's focus on capturing market share from banks reducing their mortgage activities and leveraging new opportunities in non-traditional loan products through the Aspire platform.
* Redwood doubled its lock volume with banks in 2024, accounting for 40% of total lock volume, compared to 8% before the regional bank crisis. The company also finalized its second joint venture, surpassing $1 billion in cumulative fundings.
* CFO Brooke Carillo noted, "We reported GAAP earnings of negative $8.4 million for the fourth quarter or negative $0.07 per share," with a focus on stable core earnings drivers, including an 8% increase in net interest income quarter-over-quarter.
* President Dashiell Robinson reported a 4% quarter-over-quarter increase in Sequoia lock volumes to $2.3 billion, with January 2025 lock volumes 35% ahead of Q4's pace. CoreVest fundings also rose nearly 10% sequentially to $501 million.

### Outlook

* Management anticipates a 30% year-over-year increase in Sequoia volumes, targeting a return on capital of approximately 20% for 2025. Aspire's expanded mandate is expected to access a $100 billion addressable market, potentially exceeding $2 billion in 2025 volumes.
* CoreVest's performance early in 2025 suggests annualized run rate volumes nearing $2.5 billion, with expected returns between 25% and 30%.
* The company expects to capitalize on increased opportunities from regional banks divesting mortgage portfolios, with significant growth potential for its bank seller network.
* Management highlighted that its expanded Aspire platform will include a full suite of non-QM loan products to meet growing demand from sellers.

### Financial Results

* Reported earnings available for distribution ([EAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EAD "Allspring Income Opportunities Fund")) were $18.4 million or $0.13 per share in Q4, compared to $25.2 million or $0.18 per share in Q3. The decline was attributed to nonrecurring items and normalization of HEI contributions.
* Net interest income grew 8% quarter-over-quarter to $27.6 million, representing a nearly 40% year-over-year increase, supported by $525 million in capital deployment for the year.
* Total recourse leverage decreased slightly to 2.4x from 2.5x in the prior quarter, with $245 million in unrestricted cash and $4.7 billion in warehouse financing capacity at year-end.
* CoreVest's 2024 adjusted return on capital improved to 17% from negative 3% in 2023, while Sequoiaâ€™s cost per loan improved by 59% year-over-year, surpassing efficiency targets.
