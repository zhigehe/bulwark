Norway’s $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund should be permitted to invest in defense stocks, reversing a policy of avoiding weapons makers on ethical grounds, the head of the country’s central bank said on Thursday.

The fund's current ethical guidelines were set by Norway’s parliament in 2004. They prohibit investments in defense companies involved in nuclear arms production.

As a result, the fund can’t buy shares of companies including Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF "Airbus SE")) ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")), Boeing (NYSE:[BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA "The Boeing Company")), Safran ([OTCPK:SAFRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAFRF "Safran SA")) ([OTCPK:SAFRY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAFRY "Safran SA")), RTX (NYSE:[RTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX "RTX Corporation")), BAE Systems ([OTCPK:BAESF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAESF "BAE Systems plc")) ([OTCPK:BAESY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAESY "BAE Systems plc")) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT "Lockheed Martin Corporation")).

Those rules may need to change, Norwegian central bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache said in a yearly address.

"We must be open to the possibility that what is considered to be ethically acceptable may change as the world again becomes marked by military rearmament and growing tensions between countries," Bache said.

The Conservative Party in the country wants to loosen the restrictions, highlighting the significance of defense companies that help to protect Norway and its allies.
