Curde oil futures started the week with gains Monday after three straight weeks of losses that took oil to YTD lows, undeterred by President Trump's plans to place tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports while Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. oil and gas go into effect.

Trump [officially signed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405874-trump-signs-order-imposing-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum "officially signed") proclamations imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, and the president lans tomake an announcement later this week about reciprocal tariffs for all trading partners.

Analysts said oil markets are [moving more cautiously](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250210129/oil-prices-shake-off-tariff-worries-to-finish-higher-after-3-straight-weekly-declines "moving more cautiously"), weighing whether the tariff moves are bargaining tactics or a structural shift in trade policy.

"The geopolitical premium that had supported oil values across last year have now been replaced by a tariff premium that will remain elevated for at least another three weeks until a White House decision is made regarding hefty tariffs on Canada and Mexico that will directly impact the flow of crude into the U.S.," Ritterbusch [said](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-utilities-roundup-market-talk-4fc6622c "said").

The Trump administration also raised pressure on Iran last week, with the U.S. Treasury imposing new sanctions on a few individuals and tankers that help to ship Iranian crude oil to China.

"Sanctions on Iran and Russia, they are biting... tightening the market," SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop [said](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-prices-climb-despite-trade-war-concerns-2025-02-10/ "said"), adding that rising natural gas prices also are helping oil price gains by boosting demand for cheaper fuels.

Front-month Nymex crude ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) for March delivery closed +1.8% to $72.32/bbl, and front-month April Brent crude ([CO1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM "Brent Futures")) ended +1.6% to $75.87/bbl, the largest one-day percentage gain for both benchmarks since January 15.

Colder weather forecasts for parts of the U.S. including production regions in the South and Appalachia helped lift U.S. natural gas futures, with the front-month Nymex March contract ([NG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NG1:COM "Natural Gas Futures")) closing +4.1% at $3.444/MMBtu, highest since January 29.

The Trump administration's tariff policies [could weaken global demand](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2025021011982/morgan-stanley-says-tariffs-sanctions-could-present-downside-risk-for-oil-opis "could weaken global demand"), given that tariffs can potentially hit the most oil-intensive segments of the economy the hardest, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The bank also said lower demand and the resulting uncertainty likely will lead OPEC+ to delay the gradual unwinding of its 2023-24 production cuts, a process the group had planned to begin on April 1.

Adding "supply into a period of rising trade tensions is not a compelling prospect and we suspect that OPEC+ will avoid this," Morgan Stanley said.

While the bank made no changes to its previous oil demand estimates for this year, it sees the potential that supply will be lower than previously assumed in the back half of the year, adding that an extension of OPEC+ cuts would reduce its supply forecast by 400K bbl/day.
