Earnings Call Insights: Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:[CMP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMP "Compass Minerals International, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Edward Dowling highlighted the addition of two senior leaders, Pat Merrin as COO starting in March and Peter Fjellman as CFO. Dowling emphasized their focus on operational discipline and continuous improvement under the Back-To-Basic strategy.
* Dowling discussed the Salt business, noting a 10% year-over-year reduction in North American highway deicing inventory volumes despite a slower-than-expected winter start in October and November. He attributed this reduction to production curtailments at Goderich mine in 2024, aimed at addressing supply-demand imbalances.
* Dowling mentioned that Plant Nutrition's weaker-than-expected pricing was offset by stronger sales volumes and lower costs, enabling guidance increases for the segment.
* CFO Peter Fjellman reported consolidated revenue of $307 million for Q1 2025, a 10% year-over-year decline, with adjusted EBITDA at $32 million and a consolidated net loss of $24 million. He attributed the year-over-year revenue decline to the absence of a previous contribution from Fortress.

### Outlook

* Dowling announced a reduction of $15 million in full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance due to a soft start in the Salt business, partially offset by stronger-than-expected January performance.
* Plant Nutrition's guidance was revised upward by $4 million, supported by efficiency improvements and cost reductions.
* Capital expenditure guidance was lowered by $25 million, with Dowling noting a flexible approach to managing CapEx based on deicing season outcomes.
* Management reiterated plans to refinance the company's debt stack in 2025, aiming for a structure that offers greater flexibility around covenants to align with the Back-To-Basic strategy.

### Financial Results

* Salt segment revenue was $242 million, down from $274 million in the prior year, with pricing up 1% but volumes declining 13%. Adjusted EBITDA per ton decreased 17% to $19.17, attributed to higher production costs following the 2024 curtailments at Goderich mine.
* Plant Nutrition revenue rose 24% year-over-year to $61 million, with sales volumes up 36% and production costs per ton down 10%, despite a 9% decline in pricing.
* Liquidity at quarter-end stood at $126 million, consisting of $46 million in cash and $80 million in revolver capacity.

### Q&A

* David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank: Asked about highway deicing volumes and the impact of winter weather. Dowling explained that January's strong southern market performance boosted sales projections, though overall volumes remain cautious based on early mild winter conditions.
* Joel Jackson, BMO Capital Markets: Queried the rationale behind lowering volume guidance despite recent snowfall. Dowling clarified the cautious approach, noting early-quarter shortfalls and emphasizing flexibility in guidance adjustments based on future winter conditions.
* Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan: Raised concerns about accounts receivable trends and inventory targets. Dowling and Ben Nichols highlighted plans to significantly reduce inventories while maintaining curtailed production levels at Goderich until inventory levels stabilize.
* David Silver, CL King & Associates: Asked about potential tariff impacts. Dowling stated that 2025 highway deicing operations are unlikely to be affected but noted possible implications for Canadian SOP and C&I products, depending on tariff developments.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious skepticism regarding volume guidance adjustments, particularly given recent snowfall trends. Questions on SG&A cost control and the Fortress project reflected concern over execution timelines and operational efficiency.
* Management maintained a slightly defensive tone during Q&A, emphasizing flexibility and operational discipline. Dowling reiterated a focus on "controlling the controllables" while acknowledging uncertainties in winter conditions and market dynamics.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts showed increased scrutiny of guidance revisions, while management displayed a consistent focus on maintaining flexibility and operational improvements.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for Q1 2025 reflected a $15 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA, compared to the more optimistic projections in Q4 2024.
* Strategic emphasis shifted further toward inventory management and cost reduction, particularly in the Salt business.
* Analyst focus moved from broader strategic pivots, such as the suspension of the lithium project in Q4 2024, to more granular questions about operational execution and guidance credibility.

### Risks and Concerns

* Dowling highlighted tariffs on Canadian imports as a potential risk, with implications for Salt and SOP products in the U.S. market.
* Analysts raised concerns about SG&A cost controls, particularly given flat SG&A levels compared to prior periods.
* Uncertainty regarding winter weather patterns and their impact on Salt business volumes remains a key risk.

### Final Takeaway

Compass Minerals faced challenges in Q1 2025, including mild early winter conditions impacting Salt business volumes and adjusted EBITDA guidance reductions. Management emphasized operational discipline and flexibility, supported by leadership changes and strategic cost controls. While the company highlighted progress in inventory reduction and Plant Nutrition efficiency, analysts expressed caution over guidance revisions and the potential impact of external risks such as tariffs and weather variability.
