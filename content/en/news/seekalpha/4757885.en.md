In September 2024, I [covered JAMCO](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721530-jamco-aerospace-cabin-interior-specialist-with-risks "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721530-jamco-aerospace-cabin-interior-specialist-with-risks") ([OTC:JMCCF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMCCF "JAMCO Corporation")) with a Hold rating. The stock has lost around 18% of its value since then. The company received a [buy out offer from Bain Capital](https://www.baincapital.co.jp/sites/default/files/2025-01/Press%20Release_EN_Phoenix%20press%20release_250114_final.pdf "https://www.baincapital.co.jp/sites/default/files/2025-01/Press%20Release_EN_Phoenix%20press%20release_250114_final.pdf") for 1,800 yen per share or $11.68 per share. That makes the stock price decline from $11.70 to $9.57 even more puzzling, but I do believe that the price development of the OTC ticker can be attributed to the lag of sufficient volume which subsequently does not allow for price making in line with the companyâ€™s underlying listing in Japan. In this report, I will discuss whether the deal is a fair one for shareholders.

JAMCO: A Cabin Interior Specialist

JAMCO



JAMCO is a Japanese company sporting a $241 million market capitalization. The company operates through four business segments, namely:

* Aircraft Interiors Manufacturing
* Aircraft Seats Manufacturing
* Aircraft Components Manufacturing
* Aircraft Maintenance

The aircraft interiors manufacturing business engages in aircraft cabin modifications, manufacturing of galleys used on virtually all Boeing and Airbus airplane models and the company also is the exclusive supplier of lavatories for Boeing wide body airplanes. The second segment of JAMCO is the seat manufacturing business, which is the company's newest business, founded years ago as JAMCO took over the responsibilities from a struggling supplier to equip the Singapore Airlines A380s with new seats. The segment manufactures business class seats for the A350 and first and business class seats for the Boeing 777-300ER, as well as seat consoles. The component manufacturing segment produces heat exchangers, jet engine parts and carbon-fiber reinforced polymer structural parts. The last business segment is aircraft maintenance, which deals with maintenance, repair and overhaul, including cabin interior maintenance.

### JAMCO Has Upside, But Multi-Year Upside Is Limited

To determine multi-year price targets, [The Aerospace Forum](https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link "https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link") has developed a stock screener which uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data. Each quarter, we revisit those assumptions, and the stock price targets accordingly. In a separate blog, I have detailed [our analysis methodology](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/9932311-dhierin-bechai/6058570-explaining-aerospace-forum-analysis-method#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link "https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/9932311-dhierin-bechai/6058570-explaining-aerospace-forum-analysis-method#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link").

The Aerospace Forum



Looking at the projections for 2025, we see a $9.11 fundamentally supported share price. Typically, I'm looking for a 30% premium on acquisition, which would put my preferred acquisition price at $11.85. In other words, I find the 28% premium somewhat soft, and even more given that for FY26 there should have been upside. Perhaps, JAMCO views FY26 less bullish than I do, and the business of airplane seats currently is a complex one that requires ongoing investments to cope with demand. So, perhaps in some way, the offer is fair.

I'm currently rating the stock a hold, as I believe the current OTC price does not reflect the underlying value of the stock and F stocks such as JMCCF typically get converted to cash at the acquisition price on closing, which is expected in mid-2025.

Conclusion: JAMCO Hold On Better Price Reflection
-------------------------------------------------

I believe that currently JAMCO stock is a hold as I expect the closing of the transaction to lead to the OTC ticker to be converted to cash at the acquisition price, which is higher than the current price for the OTC ticker. Looking at the acquisition premium, I do believe it's a somewhat fair one, but the deal in my view is not great but also not bad.
