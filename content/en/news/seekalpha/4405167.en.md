Communications services stocks grabbed the spotlight this week as Wall Street digested earnings report from major companies including Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) and Walt Disney ([DIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS "The Walt Disney Company")).

The communications services sector (NYSEARCA:[XLC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLC "The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund")) gained over 7% so far this year, outperforming the 3% rise in the broader S&P500 Index.

In this week's earnings recap, eight tickers reported results, out of which six companies reported an earnings beat, while two reported a miss. On the revenue side, five companies exceeded revenue expectation, while three companies trailed estimates.

Below are the latest quarterly reports from some of the key players, which reported results this week:

Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) closed nearly 7% lower Wednesday in response to its [fourth quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403045-key-takeaways-from-alphabet-earnings-after-in-line-revenues) results. The Google-parent narrowly topped profit expectations. Revenues were in line with expectations, with a few lackluster unit performances outside core beats in search and YouTube sales.

Walt Disney ([DIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS "The Walt Disney Company")) [beat](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403436-disney-beats-on-core-metrics-and-guides-an-upbeat-profit-growth-for-2025) on top and bottom-line numbers for the first quarter, helped by *Moana 2* outperformance, and the media conglomerate provided a forecast for the full year that was within Wall Street expectations.

Video game publisher Electronic Arts ([EA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EA "Electronic Arts Inc.")) [missed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403190-ea-misses-on-q3-bookings-and-guides-below-expectations-for-current-quarter) on core metrics for the fiscal third-quarter earnings and guided lower than expected for the current quarter. The company’s net bookings for Q3 fell 6.3% to $2.22B and were below the Wall Street expectations of $2.34B.

On the other hand, Take-Two Interactive Software ([TTWO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTWO "Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.")) [beat](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404823-take-two-reaffirms-full-year-bookings-forecast-sticks-to-gta-vi-launch-schedule) on the bottom line in its third-quarter earnings report and the company stuck to the launch schedule of its highly anticipated blockbuster game, *Grand Theft Auto VI,* for fall this year.

So far this quarter, 15 out of 288 companies that reported results are part of the communications services sector.

At the industry level, five media companies, two diversified telecommunications services, three interactive media and services, four entertainment firms and one wireless telecommunications service reported earnings this quarter.

Almost 80% of the S&P 500 communications services sector companies that have reported results so far this quarter, have recorded an EPS beat, 13% of companies reported a miss, while 7% were inline. In terms of revenue, 80% of the companies beat on the top line and 20% trailed estimates.
