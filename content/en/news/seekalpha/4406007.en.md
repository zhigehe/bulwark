Jefferies weighed in on the impact of Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:[H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")) acquiring Playa Hotels & Resorts ([PLYA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLYA "Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V.")) for $2.6 billion this week. Playa's ([PLYA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLYA "Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V.")) portfolio includes high-quality resorts in iconic locations and strategically important markets. The pending acquisition provides an opportunity to secure long-term management agreements for Hyatt's (NYSE:[H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")) luxury all-inclusive Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara branded properties.

Analyst David Katz said there is a lot to unpack with deal implications, but believes adding Playa ([PLYA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLYA "Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V.")) brings positive opportunities for Hyatt ([H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")), although investors may need to be patient because synergy maximization would require rebranding, which implies time and incremental cost.

Despite the considerable time and complexity issues, the transaction is seen being highly productive and accretive for Hyatt ([H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")). "Real estate recycling opportunities, coupled with operating synergies that should be available, suggest high accretion," he noted. However, the new portfolio with non-Hyatt brands is seen requiring a level of resolution and negotiation and real estate sales could present elements of risk, warned Katz.

As for deal terms, Hyatt ([H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")) expects to fund 100% of the acquisition with new debt financing and plans to pay down over 80% of the new debt financing with proceeds from asset sales, committing to complete $2 billion in asset sales by the end of the 2027 calendar year. Hyatt ([H](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/H "Hyatt Hotels Corporation")) currently holds 9.4% of PLYA's outstanding shares.

On the regulatory front, Katz and his team do not anticipate regulatory complexities, although the process and time to closing also presents incremental.

Shares of Playa ([PLYA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLYA "Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V.")) traded at $13.20 in premarket trading on Tuesday vs. the deal price of $13.50.
