**A Hold Rating For Shares Of Dakota Gold**
-------------------------------------------

This article recommends a “Hold” rating for shares of Dakota Gold Corp. (NYSE:[DC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DC "Dakota Gold Corp.")), listed on the NYSE in the United States. In the [previous article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740287-dakota-gold-has-growth-upside-potential-and-shares-are-tempting-rating-upgrade), we issued a "Buy" recommendation.

Dakota Gold Corp is exploring the Homestake gold mining district in South Dakota. The Homestake mine could be the happy rediscovery of a huge treasure trove that the United States seems to have hidden in the Homestake mining district of South Dakota. Past fortunes are no guarantee of future success, but if you want to go prospecting for gold, you drill where the yellow metal is known to be native. It's a bit like the most experienced fishers knowing at a glance where the ocean's most fertile inlets are. Driven by necessity, they would hardly venture into the uncertainties of Mother Nature if they did not give their fishing a great chance of returning with a satisfactory haul. With a production of more than 40 million ounces ("Moz") of gold over the mine's 125-year life, the plan to revive Homestake's potential is far from 'airy-fairy', but on the contrary, it makes a lot of sense.

**About Dakota Gold Corp.**
---------------------------

Dakota is a Lead, South Dakota-based gold exploration company. In our previous analysis, we rated this stock a "Buy." Here, we give it a rating that suggests the investor switch to a different stance. While the growth potential of Homestake is coming through nicely with the exploration, the stock price may have become overly optimistic in the meantime. The recent rally has been so drastic that the stock price may now be on the verge of hosting profiteers, with all the consequences, not the most pleasant, for the share price going forward. Nothing prevents investors with long-term strategic core positions from participating in profit-taking, but the basic idea is that investors, now with the Hold rating, would be wise to protect themselves against the possible share price consequences of a selling strategy in the short term. With market turmoil lurking around the corner due to Trump and his proposals that always generate much debate, the conditions for the successful implementation of a selling strategy are certainly in place. Regardless of all the indicators used to predict events, we believe that with the significant turbulence that the Trump trade could trigger at any time, the chances of stock prices retreating to significantly lower levels are still quite real.

**Since The Last Buy Rating: Dakota Gold Stock Performance**
------------------------------------------------------------

As expected in the earlier analysis, Dakota's share price, which was trading attractively low, rose +46.08% on the back of financially well-supported exploration results in pursuit of its goal of reviving the Homestake mining district. Dakota's share price has outperformed the S&P 500 by +0.87% in a favorable environment of rising gold prices. Returns are as of this writing. Gold prices were boosted because the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut of a total of one percentage point in 2024 increased the yellow metal's attractiveness over US Treasuries. Geopolitical risks are also driving investors to safe-haven assets, and gold is the safe haven par excellence.

The change in Gold Spot Price ([XAUUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR "Gold Spot Price")) was +10.44% to $2,898.63/oz at the time of this writing since the previous article.

**Exploration Progress Since The Last Article**
-----------------------------------------------

In the Homestake District, Dakota is focusing its exploration on the Maitland Gold Projects and Richmond Hill, the latter of which hosts a heap-leach developed, transformational resource, as this is where Dakota's growth in the Homestake District will originate.

Dakota Gold Corp.: Corporate Presentation - February 2025





Approximately three years of successful drilling results, driven by [higher-than-expected grades and widths](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19943419-dakota-gold-intersects-2_22-grams-per-tonne-gold-over-50-meters-at-richmond-hill-in-drill) in areas that remain open longitudinally, have resulted in the expansion and upgrade of Richmond Hill. From 1.33 million ounces of Indicated Gold Ore Resources and 1.13 million ounces of Inferred Gold Resources (as of April 30, 2024) to [3.65 million ounces](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995102-dakota-gold-reports-significant-heap-leachable-gold-at-richmond-hill-totaling-3_65-million) of Measured and Indicated Gold Resources at the time of the maiden S-K 1300 assessment announced by the company earlier this month.

Dakota is confident of recovering a very satisfactory amount of yellow metal from the leaching of these resources, and on this basis, the companies plan to complete a full feasibility study with economic analysis as early as mid-2025.

James Berry, VP Exploration at Dakota Gold, [commented](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19943419-dakota-gold-intersects-2_22-grams-per-tonne-gold-over-50-meters-at-richmond-hill-in-drill):

> *“With regards Richmond Hill, it is analogous to the adjacent Wharf Mine of Coeur Mining (*[*CDE*](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDE)*) which is expected to generate over $100 million in free cash flow in 2024 from approximately 90,000 ounces of gold.”*

The company is targeting 2029 as the start of production. In addition to the minimal risk implied by the [Sprott ESG Mining Risk Heat Map 2025](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/esg/mining-risk-heat-map/) for mining and exploration activities in North America, the proximity to key infrastructure facilities and the 15-minute drive from the town of Lead contribute positively to a scenario where Dakota can leverage Richmond Hill's location to obtain the best possible terms should the company need to raise capital through debt. In addition, the ability to raise over $300 million with Orion Mine Finance will allow Dakota to avoid much of the pressure that could come from having to raise the necessary financing. In this sense, the comprehensive agreement with Orion will ultimately help to lower borrowing costs.

James Berry, VP Exploration at Dakota Gold, [commented](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19943419-dakota-gold-intersects-2_22-grams-per-tonne-gold-over-50-meters-at-richmond-hill-in-drill):

> *Our financial proposal for up to $300 million for a development opportunity with Orion Mine Finance, our major shareholder announced on October 12, 2023, provides Dakota Gold with the financial pathway to a commercial gold operation.*

About 3 miles northwest of the Homestake mine, Dakota Gold Corp. is also exploring the **Maitland property** for new mining opportunities on 48,000 acres of land. The targets consist of the high-grade, near-surface gold mineralization of the **Unionville area** and the deeper, high-grade gold mineralization of the **JB Gold Zone**. The latter discovery has given the company hope that it can one day build a large mine producing high-grade gold ore. This hope will gain momentum as drilling progresses because, as explained in our previous analysis:

> *...the style of mineralization in this part of the Homestake property is very similar to the original Homestake gold mine, resembling some structures running along iron-shaped hinges, known in mining parlance as "Ledges".*

[![Dakota Gold Corp.: Corporate Presentation - February 2025](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/5074741-17393738085058298.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/5074741-17393738085058298_origin.png)



Dakota Gold Corp.: Corporate Presentation - February 2025





These structures along the iron formations, which contain consistent gold ore mineralization, have been significantly extended by step-out drilling to the north. Exploration is now focused on extending the mineralization to the north, but the potential for further extension exists in all directions. This is no small feat considering that the JB Gold Zone closely resembles the West Ledge System of the Homestake Mine, which returned 6 million ounces of gold.

James Berry, Vice President of Exploration for Dakota Gold and Exploration and Underground Geologist at the Homestake Mine for 10 years, [commented](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19933959-dakota-gold-step-out-drilling-nearly-doubles-the-strike-length-of-modeled-homestake-mine):

> *“The Maitland mineralization is shallower than the West Ledges of the Homestake Mine which produced more than 6 million ounces of gold. The Homestake Mine is the world’s largest banded iron formation hosted gold deposit and similar gold systems include Orla’s Musselwhite and B2’s Back River deposits.”*

**Similarities With The Musselwhite Mine And The Back River Project**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Orla Mining Ltd. ([ORLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORLA "Orla Mining Ltd.")) announced on November 18, 2024, the acquisition of the **Musselwhite Mine** from Newmont Corporation ([NEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM "Newmont Corporation")) [for up to $850 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4301635-newmont-to-sell-musselwhite-mine-in-ontario-to-orla-for-up-to-850m), but the transaction is expected to close in the [first quarter of 2025](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19971933-orla-mining-achieves-record-annual-gold-production-meets-improved-2024-production-guidance).

Announcing the “Musselwhite Mine” deal, Orla Mining [said](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19919327-orla-mining-announces-strategic-expansion-into-canada-with-acquisition-of-the-musselwhite):

> *The Transaction adds a second high quality, high margin producing asset to Orla's portfolio. The combination of the proven Musselwhite mine and Orla's low-cost Camino Rojo oxide operation more than doubles the Company's annual gold production to over 300 koz, […]. The Transaction will also significantly enhance the free cash flow of the Company, providing additional cash for the execution of Orla's organic growth plans.*

The **Back River project** covers 144,245 acres approximately 325 miles northeast of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. After a $1.5 billion investment, it is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold annually from its Goose claim block by mid-year, according to this article on [Mugglehead](https://mugglehead.com/b2gold-progresses-with-back-river-gold-project-in-preparation-for-strong-2025/).

In addition, the Mugglehead article reports the following gold occurrences for the Back River Project in southwest Nunavut, Canada, stating:

> *By the start of 2024, the Goose project contained 9.7 million metric tons of measured resources averaging 5.75 grams per metric ton (1.8 million ounces) of gold, 16.6 million metric tons of indicated resources averaging 6.18 g/t (3.3 million ounces) of gold, and 8.4 million metric tons of inferred resources averaging 6.64 g/t (1.8 million ounces) of gold.*

**Full-Year 2025 Outlook**
--------------------------

* The results of the Maitland Dakota 2024 drill program promise to be very encouraging for market sentiment as they will form the basis for drill intercepts under the 2025 follow-on drill program, “shallower” than the Homestake mine. The stock can't wait to make its voice louder in the market as the 2024 drill count takes place this year. If the current mining target appears to be a clone of the 6-million-ounce mega-mining system that South Dakota boasts and promises to be more efficient as advanced mining technology will dig closer to surface production, the combination of these factors gives an idea of ​​how stock prices might react to last year's drilling results when they come on board. And in a very favorable gold price environment, there is even more reason for this combination to be a boost to the stock price.
* Richmond Hill will continue to be the focus of exploration activity, with the northeastern part of the on-track project being pursued more aggressively than other drill targets. This from the company suggests that there could be some pretty tasty meat to nibble on in the form of resource increases already in the current year, which the market will be happy to hear, as such progress has typically documented a heady effect on share prices.
* Richmond Hill plans to complete a full feasibility study with an economic analysis as early as mid-2025, and there could be a lot of buzz surrounding the release as it is expected to speak to the project’s profitability and how its profitability is likely to respond sensitively to an increasingly bright gold price scenario. The latter, described in the next section, has a very bright future.
* The prospect of a robust gold price remains very encouraging due to the same upside catalysts we highlighted earlier in this article.

Gold price forecasts from major analysts are as follows:

Recently, Seeking Alpha [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404247-commodities-sector-at-26-month-high-ubs-lifts-gold-price-target-to-3000oz):

> UBS lifted its gold price target to $3,000/oz over the next 12 months, […]“The global gold rush continues, with the yellow metal again outshining other asset classes year-to-date as escalating trade tensions and rising geopolitical uncertainties draw investors toward gold as a portfolio diversifier,” UBS analysts said. The increased target comes as gold demand reached a record high of 4,974 metric tons in 2024, according to the [World Gold Council](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403345-gold-demand-hits-new-record-in-2024-etf-investors-likely-to-drive-market-in-2025-wgc), which also indicated that central banks' net buying exceeded 1,000 metric tons for the third straight year.

Recently, Seeking Alpha also [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401660-incredible-demand-for-physical-gold-adding-to-already-tight-market-analyst-says):

> *Goldman Sachs analysts said gold remains its "highest conviction trading recommendation across commodities, driven by structural (Central Bank buying) and cyclical (ETF buying) factors,"* [*reiterating a $3,000/oz price forecast*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-go-long-gold-amid-tariff-uncertainty-165145116.html) *for Q2 2026.*

Analysts at Trading Economics (see the "Forecast" section on this [page](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) of the Trading Economics website) have calculated the average forecast price for gold, which is $2,939.54/ounce in 12 months.

**The Stock Price: The shares Are Overbought, A Retreat To Significantly Lower Prices Could Gain Momentum**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of writing, Dakota Gold Corp.’s shares listed on the NYSE under the symbol DC were trading at $3.34/apiece, representing a market capitalization of $315.40 million.

Shares are just a touch away from the upper limit of the 52-week range of $1.84 to $3.35/share. Shares are well above the MA Ribbon.

The 14-day Relative Strength Indicator of 88.30x has exceeded the overbought levels, and this could indicate the formation of a strong sentiment that will push the stock price down and result in a significant decline to lower levels. Promoting a climate for a temporary decline to healthier price levels, which could potentially provide an opportunity to replenish portfolio holdings, is the signal to markets that Fed Chair Powell reiterated in his semiannual monetary policy report to the US Congress. Powell reiterated that the Fed's policy stance does not currently price in any urgency for an adjustment in the federal funds rate.

That's because the economy remains solid and the labor market, while cooler than last year, is still considered healthy. Rising inflation, while not entirely gone, is moving back toward the 2% medium-term target. Cutting rates too hastily in the hope of finally hitting the inflation target after more than 2 years of struggle could hurt the economy and employment too much. That “too much” could cause the Fed to miss its goal of achieving the optimal combination of employment and market price conditions, so now is the time for the Fed to pause and keep rates a little higher and a little longer than expected. A stance that calls for a "higher-for-longer" interest rate policy tends to reduce the appeal of gold bars that yield zero for a short while, and since Dakota shares are positively correlated with the yellow metal, a temporarily bearish mood on gold should also put pressure on Dakota shares.

So, it is better not to take any risks at these levels and keep the shares at the Hold recommendation given the promising prospects presented in this article. However, that doesn't mean that investors, if they wish, can't take advantage of the current record-high prices, and bring home some cash by selling shares. It would be reasonable.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Dakota Gold is a gold explorer working to revitalize the Homestake Gold District. The Homestake Gold Mine was a strong gold producer, with more than 40 million ounces of gold over 126 years.

Exploration takes place in the same mining district in close proximity to the Homestake Gold Mine, and the Richmond Hill property will be the focal point from which growth will proceed with its numerous mineral opportunities.

Richmond Hill is receiving encouraging drilling results that improve prospects for profitable gold production. The company is currently conducting a feasibility study for this project, with an economic analysis planned for mid-2025. It will be interesting to read details on how this future gold mine could perform under various gold price ranges. If the conservative scenario is already robust, as the company's drilling results announcements suggest, then with higher gold prices as the commodity continues to surprise with its upside, Richmond Hill's associated profitability projections could become a very positive factor for the stock price sentiment.

Maitland, Dakota's other Homestake property, promises to rival what years ago was an important gold deposit in the western part of the original Homestake mine. To top it off in a terrific way, Maitland is even shallower than its predecessor. Mining technology has also advanced significantly since the Homestake Gold District was commissioned, which will contribute to the efficient operation of the future mine.

There appear to be no financial issues in the offing regarding the continuation of these projects. Shares are hovering at record highs, so investors may want to hold for now. RSI suggests a reversal is gaining momentum and potentially attractive levels are looming to strengthen positions ahead of a promising future labeled “gold” in South Dakota.
