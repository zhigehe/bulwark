### Management View

* CEO Glen Messina highlighted that 2024 was a transformative year for the company, achieving a 20% adjusted ROE and the highest net income since 2013. Significant milestones included reducing corporate debt, rebranding to Onity, and delivering a 70% increase in total servicing additions compared to 2023, growing the portfolio to over $300 billion.
* Messina announced the company's intent to retain more MSRs in 2025, aiming for a 50-50 mix of owned servicing and subservicing to optimize growth. Additionally, the company plans to expand product offerings, including home equity and proprietary reverse mortgage products.
* CFO Sean O’Neil reported that Q4 adjusted pretax income was $11 million, driven by both servicing and originations. He emphasized the benefits of corporate debt restructuring, which will eliminate $14 million in annualized interest expenses starting in 2025.
* O’Neil noted that the company ended 2024 with a book value per share of $56, up from $52 in 2023.

### Outlook

* Onity provided guidance for 2025, projecting an adjusted ROE of 16%-18% and over 10% year-over-year growth in total servicing UPB. Management highlighted the scalability of their servicing platform and emphasized continued capital-light growth.
* Messina stated that the company will maintain a hedge coverage ratio of 90%-110% in 2025 to manage interest rate risk.
* Plans include leveraging technology, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency.

### Financial Results

* Q4 adjusted pretax income of $11 million marked the ninth consecutive profitable quarter. The full-year adjusted pretax income reached $90 million, reflecting an 84% increase from 2023.
* The GAAP net loss for Q4 was $29 million due to previously disclosed $41 million in corporate debt restructuring costs. However, full-year GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders totaled $33 million, the highest since 2013.
* Total servicing additions in Q4 were $25 billion, the highest quarterly level since Q2 2022. For the full year, servicing additions increased 70%, totaling $47 billion in subservicing UPB.
* Originations volume rose 33% in 2024, outpacing the industry growth of 17%.

### Q&A

* Bose George, KBW: Questioned the $14 million annualized benefit from restructuring. Sean O’Neil confirmed the figure and explained it would contribute to ROE improvement in 2025.
* Eric Hagen, BTIG: Asked about the scalability of subservicing. Messina noted that subservicing delivers an incremental contribution margin of around two basis points on average per $1 billion of new UPB.
* Randy Binner, B. Riley: Inquired about new product features in home equity and reverse mortgages. Messina emphasized customer feedback-driven improvements in pricing, equity access, and streamlined approval processes.
* Derek Sommers, Jefferies: Asked about the raised range for owned MSRs. Messina attributed it to improved balance sheet positioning and opportunities in the market.

* Strategic Focus: Continued emphasis on capital-light subservicing growth, with plans to expand owned MSRs to balance earnings.
* Key Metrics: Q4 adjusted pretax income of $11 million was lower than the $35 million reported in Q3 due to corporate debt restructuring costs. However, servicing additions and originations volumes showed sequential improvement.
* Sentiment: Analysts' questions in Q4 were more focused on scalability and subservicing growth compared to Q3's emphasis on debt refinancing.
