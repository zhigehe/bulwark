Earnings Call Insights: Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:[PACB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PACB "Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Christian Henry highlighted Q4 2024 revenue of $39.2 million, driven by the shipment of 23 Revio systems and the early shipment of seven Vega benchtop platforms, which exceeded schedule. Full-year 2024 revenue totaled $154 million, with nearly 200 Revio systems installed by year-end, 45% of which were placed with new customers.
* The adoption of HiFi long-read sequencing showed significant growth, with genomic data output increasing 81% in 2024. Consumable revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $70.4 million.
* Key strategic priorities include expanding HiFi sequencing adoption, reducing sequencing costs, and enhancing clinical applications through platforms like Vega and Revio. Berry Genomics plans to purchase 50 Vega units over the coming years for clinical applications.
* CFO Michele Farmer stated Q4 2024 non-GAAP gross margin reached 31%, up from 19% in the prior year, despite some challenges with inventory and lower ASPs due to strategic deals. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased to $68.6 million, down from $88.4 million in Q4 2023.

### Outlook

* Full-year 2025 revenue is projected to range between $155 million and $170 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The company expects instrument revenue growth to be driven by Vega shipments, while Revio placements are forecast to decline modestly.
* The non-GAAP gross margin for 2025 is expected to improve to 35%-40%, with an exit rate above 40%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are guided to fall between $270 million and $280 million, reflecting the annualization of cost reductions initiated in 2024.
* Management anticipates turning cash flow positive by the end of 2027, supported by $390 million in cash and investments.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue declined 33% year-over-year, primarily due to lower Revio shipments. Instrument revenue was $15.3 million, while consumables revenue remained stable at $18.8 million.
* Regional performance showed a 41% revenue decline in the Americas, impacted by academic funding uncertainties, while EMEA saw record consumables revenue with key projects scaling up.
* A $90 million non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge was recorded, attributed to macroeconomic headwinds.

### Q&A

* Tycho Peterson, Jefferies: Asked about the impact of NIH funding disruptions. CEO Henry explained that guidance incorporates significant headwinds, particularly in the first half of 2025, and highlighted growth opportunities in Europe and clinical markets as offsets.
* Kyle Mikson, Canaccord: Queried why Revio shipments are expected to decline in 2025. CEO Henry attributed this to macroeconomic pressures and emphasized that Vega is not significantly cannibalizing Revio sales.
* Doug Schenkel, Wolfe Research: Asked about gross margin improvements and initiatives to reduce adoption friction. CEO Henry detailed ongoing cost reductions in manufacturing and highlighted financial programs like Run Revio to support adoption.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious concern over macroeconomic challenges and NIH funding uncertainties but were optimistic about Vega’s potential and clinical market expansion.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic progress and financial discipline. However, in Q&A, the tone was slightly defensive when addressing macroeconomic risks and Revio shipment declines.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s sentiment remained consistent, focusing on long-term growth despite near-term challenges.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue guidance language shifted slightly to reflect more conservative expectations amid funding uncertainties. The focus on Vega as a growth driver intensified, while Revio placements were anticipated to decline modestly.
* Analysts’ concerns remained consistent, centering on macroeconomic pressures and clinical adoption timelines.
* Management confidence in gross margin improvement and emerging clinical opportunities remained strong, with continued emphasis on long-term strategic priorities.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted uncertain funding dynamics, particularly in the Americas, as a key risk. NIH funding caps and prolonged sales cycles in the academic sector were underscored as challenges.
* The macroeconomic environment was noted as a potential headwind for high-capital purchases like Revio.
* To mitigate risks, the company is focusing on clinical market growth and cost-control measures to improve gross margins and cash flow.

### Final Takeaway

Pacific Biosciences of California emphasized its strategic focus on expanding HiFi sequencing through product innovations like Vega and Revio. While macroeconomic uncertainties and academic funding challenges weighed on short-term outlooks, the company remains confident in its ability to drive growth through clinical market adoption, cost reductions, and long-term investments in innovative sequencing solutions.
