Earnings Call Insights: Interpublic Group (NYSE:[IPG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPG "The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Philippe Krakowsky reported a Q4 organic revenue decline of 1.8%, bringing full-year organic growth to 0.2%. He attributed this to intensified headwinds from trailing account losses but highlighted strong growth in food and beverage, technology, and telecom. Notable new business wins included Amgen, Volvo, and Kimberly-Clark.
* Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q4 was 24.3%, achieving the full-year target of 16.6%. Total capital returned to shareholders amounted to $727 million for the year.
* Discussing the pending merger with Omnicom, Krakowsky stated, "the free cash flow of the combined companies will be very substantial," allowing for increased dividends, share buybacks, and investments in talent and technology.
* CFO Ellen Johnson reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.11 and full-year adjusted EPS of $2.77, emphasizing the company’s strong cash position of $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x.

### Outlook

* Management expects a 2025 organic revenue decline of 1%-2%, driven by a 4.5%-5% drag from trailing account losses. These challenges are anticipated to ease in the second half of the year.
* Adjusted EBITDA margins are targeted at 16.6% for 2025, supported by $250 million in cost savings from restructuring initiatives. These include centralizing corporate functions, offshoring, and optimizing real estate.
* The $250 million in savings is independent of the $750 million in cost synergies anticipated from the Omnicom merger.

### Financial Results

Integrated Advertising & Creativity Led Solutions saw a 4.7% organic decline, while Specialized Communication & Experiential Solutions posted 1.3% organic growth.
* U.S. organic revenue declined 3.2%, while Latin America and other international markets showed robust growth of 10.4% and 12.1%, respectively.
* Full-year operational cash flow reached $1.06 billion, with $141.8 million in capital expenditures.
