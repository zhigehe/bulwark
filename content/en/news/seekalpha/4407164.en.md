Earnings Call Insights: Sound Point Meridian Capital Inc (NYSE:[SPMC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPMC "Sound Point Meridian Capital Inc")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Ujjaval Desai reported strong results for the third fiscal quarter, with net investment income (NII) of $12.5 million, or $0.62 per share, and net realized gains of $0.10 per share. The net asset value (NAV) per share increased to $20.52, driven by CLO resets and mark-to-market gains from tighter trading yields.
* The company deployed $43.4 million into eight CLO warehouse investments and closed six new warehouses, resulting in six new equity positions with an amortized cost of $66.7 million. Two additional warehouses were priced, committing $28.4 million to new CLO equity positions.
* CFO Kevin Gerlitz highlighted GAAP net income of $32.2 million, or $1.59 per share, and total assets of $523.4 million as of December 31, 2024. Available liquidity stood at $19.7 million, and the investment portfolio's fair value reached $503.7 million.
* Desai announced an increase in monthly distributions to $0.25 per share for Q2 2025, reflecting a 4.2% rise over the prior quarter, consistent with the company's IPO strategy of steadily raising distributions.

### Outlook

* Desai stated that the company remains bullish on CLO equity, emphasizing its potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. The company plans to fully deploy the remaining $40 million from its senior financing facility shortly and is considering raising additional capital through preferred stock, senior facilities, or equity offerings, depending on market conditions.
* Management highlighted that rate cuts in 2024 modestly impacted near-term CLO equity yields but viewed these cuts as a medium-term positive due to reduced liability costs and potentially lower corporate default rates. The trailing 12-month default rate remains low at 1.5%.
* The company expects to unlock additional reset optionality within its portfolio, assuming stable market conditions, which could further enhance NAV and provide attractive returns.

### Financial Results

* The company recorded net realized gains of $2 million and unrealized gains of $17.7 million during the quarter. Total expenses were $7.5 million.
* NAV per share increased to $20.52 as of December 31, 2024, with a subsequent rise to $20.56 by January 31, 2025, indicating continued portfolio gains.
* Weighted average GAAP yield on the equity portfolio slightly declined to 15.2%, primarily due to loan repricings. This was partially offset by refinancing and reset activities, which lowered CLO liability costs.
* During the quarter, the company declared monthly income distributions of $0.24 per share, representing an annualized yield of 13.8% based on the December 31 share price.

### Q&A

* Randy Binner, B. Riley: Asked about credit quality and default activity in the active primary CLO market. CFO Kevin Gerlitz stated that default rates remain low at 1.5%, and the company focuses on minimizing tail risk by selecting high-quality managers and monitoring loans trading below $0.90 on the dollar.
* Binner also inquired about the use of quantitative systems for investment selection. Gerlitz explained the company's proprietary Compass system, which screens data to identify high-performing managers and portfolios. He emphasized the importance of active portfolio trading to maintain credit quality.
* Erik Zwick, Lucid Capital Markets: Asked about risk-reward dynamics between primary and secondary markets. Desai stated that primary equity offers cleaner portfolios and higher returns, with new issue investments yielding over 17% compared to lower returns in the secondary market.
* Zwick questioned funding strategies amid the current interest rate environment. Desai noted that the company would evaluate fixed versus floating rates once the existing facilities are fully deployed and market conditions are reassessed.
* Zwick inquired about unrealized gains. Desai attributed these gains to CLO resets, which unlock value by reducing liability costs, and tighter market yields, which increase secondary market valuations.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts focused on credit quality, deployment pace, and funding strategies, indicating neutral to slightly positive sentiment. Their questions reflected confidence in the company's strategy but sought clarity on future plans.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strong results and strategic opportunities. Phrases like "we are pleased" and "we remain bullish" underscored their optimism.
* Management's Q&A responses were detailed and proactive, addressing concerns directly, which contrasted slightly with the prepared remarks' more generalized confidence.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* No comparison was made to the previous quarter due to the unavailability of the prior transcript.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged that loan repricings reduced GAAP yields, but refinancing and reset activities mitigated the impact by lowering liability costs.
* Analysts raised concerns about credit quality in new CLO issues and potential risks in tail-end loans. Management emphasized diversification and rigorous manager selection to manage these risks effectively.
* The potential need for additional capital and the decision between fixed and floating rates were highlighted as areas of focus, with management indicating these would be determined by market conditions.

### Final Takeaway

Sound Point Meridian Capital Inc delivered robust Q3 2025 results, supported by NAV growth to $20.56 and an increase in quarterly distributions. The company's strategic focus on CLO equity, disciplined investment approach, and proactive portfolio management position it well for sustained growth and attractive returns. Management's confidence in navigating market conditions and leveraging reset opportunities further underscores the company's momentum for the coming quarters.
