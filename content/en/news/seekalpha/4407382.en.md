Earnings Call Insights: ASX Limited ([OTCPK:ASXFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASXFF "ASX Limited")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* CEO Helen Lofthouse highlighted record operating revenue for the first half of FY 2025, driven by strong performances across markets, Technology & Data, and Securities & Payments businesses. She emphasized the company's focus on regulatory and risk management uplift and technology modernization as part of its five-year strategy.
* Underlying net profit after tax grew by 10.1%, supported by higher net interest income. A fully franked interim dividend of $1.112 per share was announced, reflecting a payout ratio of 85% of underlying NPAT.
* CFO Andrew Tobin noted, "Operating revenue was $541.9 million for the half, which was an increase of 5.9%. Total expenses for the period were $220.3 million, down 0.2%, reflecting our continued focus on expense management."
* Tobin also highlighted an EBIT margin increase to 59.3%, supported by revenue growth and net interest income improvements.
* The company reported significant progress in technology projects, including updates to the trading, derivatives clearing, and CHESS systems, with major rollouts planned for the remainder of FY 2025.

### Outlook

* Management reconfirmed FY 2025 total expense growth guidance of 6% to 9%, with operating expense growth expected between 4% and 7%. Capital expenditure for FY 2025 is projected between $160 million and $180 million, with similar levels anticipated through FY 2027.
* CEO Lofthouse stated, "We remain focused on underlying ROE as the key performance metric," targeting disciplined cost management and revenue opportunities.
* The company anticipates continued volatility in cash markets, driven by central bank rate speculation and geopolitical factors. Futures and options volumes are expected to benefit from these dynamics.

### Financial Results

* Record operating revenue of $541.9 million was achieved, up 5.9% from the prior year. Total expenses decreased slightly to $220.3 million, reflecting cost management measures.
* Net interest income increased by 9.4% to $43.1 million, supported by higher net interest from ASX’s cash and collateral balances. Collateral balances averaged $11.9 billion in the period, contributing to improved investment spreads.
* Technology & Data revenue grew by 6.7% to $132.9 million, driven by strong demand for derivatives market data and modest growth in data center services.
* Securities & Payments revenue rose 5.2% to $135.7 million, with key contributions from equity post-trade services and Austraclear transaction volumes.
* The company confirmed an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, reflecting ongoing investments in technology modernization projects.

### Q&A

* Andrei Stadnik, Morgan Stanley: "Is slow revenue growth in futures a function of mix or pricing?" Helen Lofthouse responded, "It’s very much a function of change in mix, with strong growth in rates products, which are at the lowest price points."
* Ed Henning, CLSA: "How are costs tracking, and are you leaning toward the high or low end of guidance?" Andrew Tobin answered, "We’re comfortable with our guidance, but costs will rise in the second half due to equipment costs and depreciation."
* Freya Kong, Bank of America: "What is the revenue opportunity from new trading windows?" Lofthouse stated, "We see revenue potential, but it’s unlikely to be material this year."
* Nigel Pittaway, Citi: "Is there confidence in revenue growth given expected cost increases?" Lofthouse replied, "While we don’t guide on revenue, current volatility supports activity levels."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about slow revenue growth in specific segments and the cost trajectory, reflecting a slightly negative sentiment. They focused on the mix of futures volumes and pricing, as well as the pace of cost increases relative to revenue growth.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing disciplined cost management and progress on strategic initiatives. Phrases like "very pleased" and "significant progress" were used during prepared remarks, while responses in the Q&A, such as "we remain focused," reflected a controlled and measured approach.
* Compared to prior quarters, management appeared more defensive in addressing cost concerns but reinforced confidence in strategic execution and financial outcomes.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language remained consistent, reiterating expense growth and CapEx targets. Strategic focus continued on technology modernization and regulatory compliance.
* Analysts focused on recurring themes of cost management and revenue growth sustainability, showing continued skepticism about cost increases.
* Management tone remained confident but slightly more defensive when addressing potential headwinds, such as regulatory investigations and cost pressures.

### Risks and Concerns

* The ASIC investigation into the CHESS batch settlement incident was noted as an ongoing matter. Management stated they are cooperating fully and emphasized that this does not impact the overall strategy.
* Analysts expressed concerns over cost growth and its alignment with revenue performance. Questions were raised about the scalability of new initiatives and their near-term revenue impact.
