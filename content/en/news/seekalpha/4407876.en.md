Earnings Call Insights: Ipsen ([OTCPK:IPSEY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPSEY "Ipsen S.A.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO David Loew emphasized Ipsen’s sustained growth in 2024, with total sales increasing by 9.9%. He highlighted the strong performance of the ex-Somatuline portfolio, which grew by 12.2%, and outlined a core operating margin of 32.6%. Key pipeline achievements included FDA approval of ONIVYDE for first-line pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, U.S. approval of IQIRVO, and EU approval of Kayfanda.
* The company projects sales growth of more than 5% at constant exchange rates for 2025, with a core operating margin greater than 30%. Significant milestones include the anticipated European approval of Cabometyx for neuroendocrine tumors and the filing of Tovorafenib in Europe in H1 2025, along with pivotal trial results for Fidrisertib and proof-of-concept data for LANT in H2.
* CFO Aymeric Le Chatelier noted Ipsen’s solid financial position, with total sales exceeding €3.4 billion and free cash flow at €774 million. He added, "Our core operating income grew by 10.8% to €1.1 billion," and emphasized the company’s available firepower of €2.3 billion for external innovation.

### Outlook

* Ipsen expects total sales growth of more than 5% at constant exchange rates in 2025, supported by the continued expansion of products like IQIRVO, ONIVYDE, and Bylvay. However, Somatuline faces increased erosion from generic competition, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.
* The company anticipates a core operating margin of more than 30% for 2025, with ongoing investments in R&D and commercialization efforts in the U.S. and Europe. Management highlighted upcoming regulatory milestones, including EU decisions on Cabometyx and Tovorafenib, as well as pivotal trial outcomes for Fidrisertib and LANT.

### Financial Results

* Ipsen reported total sales of €3.4 billion for 2024, reflecting a growth rate of 9.9% at constant exchange rates. The core operating margin for the year reached 32.6%, a 0.6 percentage point improvement.
* R&D expenditures exceeded 20% of sales for the first time, driven by investments in Ipsen’s internal pipeline and external innovation. SG&A costs increased by 3.3%, reflecting commercial investments for product launches.
* Notable financial impacts included a €281 million impairment loss related to Sohonos, attributed to lower-than-expected patient uptake. Ipsen revised downward its peak sales expectations for Sohonos to below €100 million.

### Q&A

* Xian Deng, UBS, inquired about Somatuline’s erosion pattern in 2025. CEO David Loew highlighted accelerated erosion due to increased generic competition, with uncertainties around market dynamics in the U.S. and Europe.
* John Priestner, JPMorgan, asked about the 2025 margin guidance and Dysport shipment phasing. CFO Le Chatelier explained that margin contraction is driven by Somatuline erosion and R&D investments, with lower profitability expected in H2 due to cost phasing and generic competition. He noted strong underlying demand for Dysport despite shipment fluctuations.
* Simon Baker, Redburn Atlantic, queried about IQIRVO’s launch dynamics and ONIVYDE’s market share in first-line pancreatic cancer. CEO Loew described IQIRVO’s strong uptake in the U.S. and Europe, supported by new data on fatigue improvement. He stated that ONIVYDE’s growth is concentrated in academic centers, with a focus on expanding into community practices.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed concerns about generic competition for Somatuline and margin pressures from increased R&D investments. Sentiment was slightly negative, particularly regarding uncertainties in market dynamics and competition.
* Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing Ipsen’s strong pipeline, financial flexibility, and strategic focus on key launches. Statements showed confidence, such as "We are confident..." and "We continue to see robust growth."
* Compared to prior quarters, management appeared more defensive on Somatuline, balancing concerns with optimism about the broader portfolio and pipeline.

### Risks and Concerns

* Increased competition and erosion for Somatuline in the U.S. and Europe pose significant challenges. Management anticipates an accelerated erosion pattern in 2025.
* The impairment loss related to Sohonos reflects difficulties in patient uptake and revised expectations for sales performance.
* Analysts raised concerns about long-term margins, particularly due to heightened R&D investments and the impact of generic competition.

### Final Takeaway

Ipsen delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2024, supported by growth across its portfolio and strategic pipeline advancements. However, the company faces challenges from Somatuline’s erosion and competitive dynamics. With a robust R&D pipeline, key regulatory milestones, and financial flexibility, Ipsen aims to sustain growth and navigate competitive pressures in 2025. Investors should monitor the progress of product launches and pivotal trial outcomes as critical drivers of future performance.
