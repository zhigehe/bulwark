Earnings Call Insights: Konecranes Plc ([OTCPK:KNCRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KNCRF "Konecranes Plc")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Anders Svensson highlighted a strong end to the year, with record quarterly sales of €1.213 billion and an all-time high Q4 comparable EBITA margin of 13.2%. Free cash flow was noted as excellent at €170 million, and the 2024 dividend proposal was raised to €1.65 per share, reflecting a €0.30 increase from the prior year.
* Order intake reached €1.167 billion, making it the second-highest quarter ever, with a 26% year-on-year increase. Growth was driven by strong order performance in Ports and Industrial Equipment, with EMEA and Americas showing gains, while APAC declined.
* CFO Teo Ottola explained that the comparable EBITA margin improvement was driven by volume growth, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency, with fixed costs well-controlled.
* CEO Svensson announced his decision to leave the company in July 2025, with the board initiating the search for a new CEO.

### Outlook

* Management guided 2025 net sales to remain approximately at 2024 levels, with the comparable EBITA margin expected to remain stable or improve.
* Demand in industrial segments was described as healthy, with stable order pipelines in process cranes and ports. However, interest rates continue to delay customer decision-making for larger projects.
* Ports are expected to see continued strong container throughput and robust long-term global prospects. The sales funnel for automation and other port projects remains strong but subject to timing uncertainties.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue reached €1.213 billion, up 5.5% year-on-year, driven by growth across all segments. The Americas and APAC regions showed significant growth, while EMEA remained flat.
* Comparable EBITA reached €159.5 million, representing a margin of 13.2%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. The improvement was attributed to pricing, volume leverage, and operational efficiencies.
* The Service segment achieved a 0.4 percentage point EBITA margin improvement year-on-year to 20.6%, supported by pricing and volume growth. Industrial Equipment saw a 2.7 percentage point EBITA margin increase to 9.7%, driven by strong volume and efficiency gains. Ports' EBITA margin improved 1.7 percentage points to 9.7%, reflecting strategic execution and pricing gains.
* The order book grew €41 million sequentially but declined €150 million year-on-year, reflecting a shift in the mix of long-term projects.

### Q&A

* Ilaria Buricelli, Goldman Sachs, asked about U.S. market share gains due to tariffs on Chinese cranes. CEO Svensson noted some share gains in Service but no significant impact yet on STS cranes due to long project timelines.
* Antti Kansanen, SEB, inquired about increased industrial demand despite challenging macro indicators. Svensson attributed it to strength in the U.S., stable European activity, and improved sales funnels.
* Mikael Doepel, Nordea, asked about Service margin improvements for 2025. Svensson cited productivity gains through AI-based workforce planning and new service products as key drivers.
* Panu Laitinmäki, Danske Bank, questioned regional demand and customer segments. Svensson identified power and logistics as strong sectors, while paper and forest, construction, and engineering were weaker.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on potential risks from tariffs and macro challenges but acknowledged strong order intake and profitability improvements. Their tone was slightly positive, especially around operational efficiency and demand resilience.
