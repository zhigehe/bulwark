Earnings Call Insights: Roku (NASDAQ:[ROKU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU "Roku, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Anthony Wood highlighted the strong Q4 performance, driven by the company’s platform revenue strategy. Wood emphasized three key pillars: leveraging the home screen as a core asset, expanding third-party ad demand partnerships, and focusing on subscription revenue growth through more resources and home screen integrations.
* Advertising revenue saw notable strength, even excluding political ads. The introduction of unique ad units, such as the home screen’s Video Marquee ad, contributed to the quarter’s success.
* CFO Dan Jedda noted platform revenue grew 25% year-over-year in Q4, with 19% growth excluding political contributions. He provided guidance for 16% platform revenue growth in Q1 2025 and 12% growth for full-year 2025, excluding political impacts.
* Mustafa Ozgen, President of Devices, shared that Roku OS continued its dominance as the top-selling TV OS in the U.S. for six consecutive years, with Roku TVs surpassing the next two competing operating systems combined in unit sales.

### Outlook

* For Q1 2025, Roku projects platform revenue growth of 16% year-over-year, with advertising activities expected to grow faster than streaming services distribution.
* Full-year 2025 platform revenue is expected to grow 12%, or 15% excluding political impacts, reflecting an acceleration compared to 2024 growth rates.
* Jedda highlighted an adjusted EBITDA margin improvement of 130 basis points year-over-year for 2025, with free cash flow anticipated to exceed adjusted EBITDA.

### Financial Results

* Platform revenue in Q4 2024 increased by 25% year-over-year, boosted by advertising and subscription revenues. Excluding political contributions, platform revenue grew 19%.
* Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 reflects a $350 million target, with free cash flow expected to outpace EBITDA due to improved working capital and capital expenditure management.
* Device revenue was impacted by aggressive holiday discounting, leading to excess inventory that will carry over into Q1 2025. For the full year 2025, device gross profit is expected to be flat compared to 2024.

### Q&A

* Shyam Patil, Susquehanna, inquired about free cash flow trends and growth sustainability in 2025. CFO Jedda confirmed free cash flow exceeded $200 million in 2024 and is expected to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA in 2025.
* Michael Morris, Guggenheim, asked about drivers of Q1 platform revenue growth and the impact of Walmart’s Vizio acquisition. Jedda highlighted strong contributions from advertising and subscriptions, while CEO Wood expressed confidence in Roku’s ability to continue growing streaming households despite Walmart’s acquisition.
* Laura Martin, Needham, questioned the subscription business’s growth trajectory. CEO Wood emphasized increased focus and resource allocation, including new premium partnerships like MAX, as drivers for subscription growth.
* Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo, raised concerns about industry shifts toward ad-supported tiers in SSD revenue. CFO Jedda explained that Roku’s monetization adapts to partner pricing strategies and ensures alignment with partner success.

* Confidence in platform revenue growth improved, with management projecting higher year-over-year growth rates in 2025 compared to 2024.

* Management’s focus on leveraging the home screen and expanding third-party partnerships remained consistent, with additional emphasis on subscription growth in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Political advertising revenue remains unpredictable, creating variability in short-term results.
* Device segment profitability faced challenges due to holiday discounting and excess inventory, which could pressure margins in Q1 2025.
* The M&E vertical continues to underperform, though management has diversified revenue streams to mitigate its impact.
