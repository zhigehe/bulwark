Consumer Staples Sector (NYSEARCA:[XLP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLP)) was in focus during the week as investors digested earnings reports from major firms including PepsiCo ([PEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP "PepsiCo, Inc.")), Philip Morris International ([PM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM "Philip Morris International Inc.")) and Mondelez International ([MDLZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ "Mondelez International, Inc.")) among others.

The Consumer Staples Sector (NYSEARCA:[XLP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLP "The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")) gained nearly 1% so far this year, compared to the 3% rise in the broader S&P500 Index.

In this week's earnings recap, 11 tickers reported results, out of which eight companies reported an earnings beat, one was in-line, while two reported a miss. On the revenue side, six companies exceeded revenue expectation, while five companies trailed estimates.

Below are the latest quarterly reports from some of the key players, which reported results this week:

PepsiCo ([PEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP "PepsiCo, Inc.")) shares [closed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402977-pepsico-may-look-to-add-more-healthy-snack-products-amid-organic-sales-challenges) 4.5% lower on Tuesday after posting a mixed Q4 earnings report. Organic revenue was up 2.1% for the quarter to fall slightly short of the consensus expectation of +2.2%. The food and beverage giant noted that salty and savory snack categories underperformed broader packaged food in 2024 and that the cumulative impacts of inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs on consumer budgets cut into demand.

Philip Morris ([PM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM "Philip Morris International Inc.")) [topped](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404328-philip-morris-rallies-after-operating-income-shines-in-q4-amid-the-companys-smoke-free-transformation) Q4 EPS as well as revenue estimates, resulting in shares jumping nearly 11% on Thursday. The smoke-free business in Q4 accounted for 40% of PM's total revenue and around 42% of gross profit.

Mondelez International ([MDLZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ "Mondelez International, Inc.")) [missed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403066-mondelez-international-falls-after-posting-a-mixed-earnings-report-warning-on-unprecedented-cocoa-costs) Q4 revenue estimates by $60 million but beat EPS expectations by $0.04 to $0.69. Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted EPS to decline approximately 10% on a constant currency basis due to unprecedented cocoa cost inflation.

Meanwhile, Hershey’s ([HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) offsetting strategies to counter the meteoric rise in cocoa price [delivered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404351-hersheys-hedging-strategies-sweetens-q4-bottom-line) a solid Q4 for the candy company as net income swelled 131% resulting in a 33% gain in earnings per share.

So far this quarter, 20 out of 288 companies that reported results are part of the Consumer Staples Sector.

At the industry level, two beverage companies, two distribution and retail, seven food products, five household products, two personal care products and two tobacco firms reported earnings this quarter.

Almost 70% of the S&P 500 consumer staples sector companies that have reported results so far this quarter, have recorded an EPS beat, 10% were in-line, while 20% of companies reported a miss. In terms of revenue, 65% of the companies beat on the top line and 35% trailed estimates.
