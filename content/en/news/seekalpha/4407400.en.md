Earnings Call Insights: Fastly (NYSE:[FSLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLY "Fastly, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Todd Nightingale announced record Q4 revenue of $140.6M, exceeding the guidance range of $136M to $140M. This represents 2% growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. He attributed this to better-than-expected seasonal traffic and share gains.
* Diversification efforts were emphasized, with the revenue contribution from the top 10 customers dropping to 32% in Q4 from 33% in Q3 and 40% at the end of 2023. Revenue outside the top 10 customers grew 16% year-over-year.
* Fastly’s enterprise customer count rose to 596, a 3% increase both year-over-year and sequentially. The company also highlighted significant pipeline momentum.
* New product introductions included the AI Accelerator for semantic caching and Fastly’s Object Storage, both aimed at reducing costs and enhancing performance for customers.
* CFO Ronald Kisling reported that Q4 non-GAAP operating loss was $4.2M, within the guidance range of $1M to $5M. He also noted an annual increase in cash from operations to $16M and a reduction in cash flow burn to $36M.

### Outlook

* Management provided 2025 revenue guidance in the range of $575M to $585M, reflecting 7% annual growth at the midpoint.
* For Q1 2025, revenue guidance was set at $136M to $140M, with a non-GAAP operating loss expected between $11M and $7M.
* CFO Ronald Kisling stated that Fastly anticipates 2025 gross margins to remain flat relative to 2024, with incremental traffic growth in emerging regions impacting margins.
* Management excluded U.S. revenue from TikTok beyond Q1 due to legislative uncertainties, noting ByteDance represented less than 10% of 2024 revenue globally.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue of $140.6M compared to analysts’ estimate of $138.63M. Adjusted EPS was not explicitly stated in the transcript.
* Security revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $26.9M. Excluding a prior-year one-time payment, normalized security revenue growth was 17%.
* The "Other" category, including emerging products, grew 63% year-over-year to $3.6M, driven by compute offerings.
* Annual revenue for 2024 reached $544M, marking 7% year-over-year growth. However, this came below the original guidance of $580M to $590M issued a year ago.
* Gross margin for Q4 was 56.5%, down from 57.7% in Q3 and 59.2% in Q4 2023. This was attributed to higher bandwidth costs and an increased mix of international traffic.

### Q&A

* Frank Louthan, Raymond James: Asked about investments for APAC expansion. CFO Ronald Kisling stated that capital investments would be minimal, with focus on hiring a dedicated leader for the region. CEO Todd Nightingale emphasized potential in the underpenetrated APAC market.
* Madeline Brooks, Bank of America: Questioned the slow security growth compared to competitors. CEO Nightingale acknowledged the need for better results and highlighted ongoing investments in security go-to-market efforts and leadership.
* Rudy Kessinger, D.A. Davidson: Inquired about Edgio’s shutdown impact. CEO Nightingale noted more than 10 new logos from Edgio’s former customers and highlighted efforts to onboard additional traffic while balancing capital spend.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed mixed sentiment, balancing optimism about revenue diversification and security growth with concerns over top 10 customer headwinds and gross margin pressure. For example, Rudy Kessinger expressed interest in Edgio-related share gains, while Madeline Brooks raised questions about security growth challenges.
* CEO Nightingale maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, citing product innovation and diversified customer acquisition. However, his responses during Q&A reflected an acknowledgment of challenges, particularly in the security segment.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone showed a slight increase in confidence, particularly regarding diversification efforts and 2025 guidance.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue grew sequentially from $137.2M in Q3 to $140.6M in Q4, driven by seasonal traffic and share gains.
* Gross margin declined from 57.7% in Q3 to 56.5% in Q4 due to increased bandwidth costs and a higher mix of international traffic.
* Security revenue growth normalized at 17% in Q4 compared to 12% in Q3.
* Enterprise customer count rebounded in Q4, rising to 596 from 576 in Q3, reversing the sequential decline seen previously.
* Management’s tone was more optimistic in Q4, particularly regarding diversification and long-term growth prospects.

### Risks and Concerns

* Legislative scrutiny of TikTok poses revenue risks, with management excluding U.S. revenue from the customer beyond Q1 in guidance.
* Competitive pressures in the security market remain a challenge, with slower growth compared to larger competitors.
* International traffic growth is expected to exert downward pressure on gross margins in the near term.
* Continued dependency on large customers, though decreasing, still represents a concentration risk.

### Final Takeaway

Fastly closed 2024 with record Q4 revenue of $140.6M and achieved significant progress in diversifying revenue streams. The company is focused on driving growth through expanded security offerings, geographic expansion, and new product innovations like the AI Accelerator. However, challenges such as gross margin pressure, competitive security dynamics, and TikTok-related uncertainties highlight the need for cautious optimism as Fastly aims for 7% revenue growth in 2025.
