The offshore supply vessel (OSV) market remains challenged today amid oil volatility, lower market demand, and tensions in Europe and the Middle East. Despite this, Tidewater, Inc. (NYSE: [TDW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TDW "Tidewater Inc.")) maintains its operational stability and strong financial positioning to weather uncertainties. And even if the short-term outlook may not be rosy, some risk mitigants can help TDW and its peers. In addition, the stock shows reasonable upside potential with its current valuation. Its technicals support this as they suggest that there is huge room for taking a buy position.

Q324: Tidewater Stays Well-Positioned
-------------------------------------

Amid the challenges the market faced during the second half, Tidewater, Inc. maintained solid topline growth with its strategic market positioning.

Its operating revenue rose by 14% YoY to [$340.4M](https://investor.tdw.com/news/news-details/2024/Tidewater-Reports-Results-for-the-Three-and-Nine-Months-Ended-September-30-2024/default.aspx) from $299.3 in Q323. The increase was most prominent in Asia Pacific and West Africa with revenues growing by 44% and 29%, respectively. Note that 68 or 31% of its total fleets were in West Africa, which I think worked to its advantage. One, it has a very strategic location. Second, it has a more stable geopolitical condition than the Mediterranean and Middle East, given the Russo-Ukrainian and Israel-Hamas wars. Among its fleets, PSV <900 and AHTS > 16k became the core drivers after their revenues became stagnant from Q223 to Q124.

But the real cornerstone of its operations was its strategic pricing. We know that many market forces have been unfavorable for the OSV market in the past year. For example, [Brent](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil) and [WTI](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/crude-oil) crude oil prices dropped amid the softer demand and increasing OPEC oil output. This decreased the demand for OSVs, leading to lower utilization rates. So with its prudent pricing strategy, revenues still increased. On average, utilization rates dropped by 4.5%. Meanwhile, daily vessel rates went up by 5.4%, completely offsetting the impact of lower utilization rates.

What I like most about TDW is its operational efficiency, which supported its topline growth. Its operating margin increased from 18.3% to 20.5% YoY. We can further confirm its efficiency through its operating leverage, which improved from 67.9% and 67.3% in Q323 and Q224 to 66.3%. This shows the company became less cost-sensitive as the contribution of variable costs decreased. It also implied more stability, which could be crucial for OSVs due to market volatility.

Relative to the global market, TDW performed very well and was much better than most companies. It had higher utilization and daily rates, showing increased efficiency, pricing flexibility, and demand. Its popularity and market presence with over 200 vessels helped capture more demand and maintain a solid customer base. To be more specific, we can compare it to some notable peers, although many OSVs of Solstad ([OTCPK:SLOFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLOFF "Solstad Offshore ASA")) were already bought by TDW. It may not have the best revenue growth. Yet, it had the best operating margin among the group.

Liquidity
---------

This asset-heavy company in a volatile market may have high capital requirements to remain operational and/or expand. I think this is one of the core strengths of TDW. After all, it already has 213 vessels, holding 8% of the total global OSV supply.

Currently, it has stable cash levels above $200M in the past five quarters. It comprises 45% of the current assets and 14% of the total assets, making it a liquid company. If we combine it with receivables, their total will be equal to nearly 30% of the total assets. In addition, cash alone is more than enough to pay all current liabilities in an instant.

Meanwhile, its borrowings have been decreasing since Q323. Over 90% have maturities of more than one year. In addition, 41% will not mature until FY28, so TDW has enough time to pay for all this. More importantly, it has enough earnings to cover all borrowings in less than a year. Its Net Debt/EBITDA remains very low at only 0.89x.

Lastly, TDW maintains efficient revenue management with its 13% FCF/Sales Ratio. This shows that the portion of OSV revenues was converted into free cash after deducting its capital expenditures.

Areas of Consideration
----------------------

At this point, it is safe to say that TDW remains well-positioned for market volatility and headwinds. There may be doubts about its performance, but its cost-efficiency and high liquidity may be enough to withstand softer external factors. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight other factors that affect its performance. Here are the things I think we should look into when assessing TDW.

### OSV Age and Market Supply

TDW appears to have an edge over the global market regarding OSV age. Currently, the average of its vessels is [12.4 years](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000098222/519a5a65-977f-4c35-ae39-b6ebfe9ac9c2.pdf), about three years younger than the global average. Suppose no new vessels will be produced, the existing vessels will last until FY2030, while TDW’s vessels can operate until 2033. That’s theoretical, of course.

The challenge right now is that its capex is still very low to produce new fleets. Nonetheless, I don’t think it’s that alarming for several reasons. First, vessels can last for 20 years, some even reach 25 years. So, TDW still has about eight years to get new ones. Second, utilization rates are still low, so rushing in may not be a prudent move. Third, it has stable cash levels, high FCF/Sales conversion rates, and low borrowings.

Another thing to consider now is the decreasing supply of OSV. Although the demand remains soft right now, the decreasing supply of OSV can be advantageous for TDW. From its presentation last [August](https://s25.q4cdn.com/923634175/files/doc_presentations/2024/08/TDW-IR-Deck-Jun-2024-_vf.pdf)

to November, we saw that the global OSV supply dropped by 26%. It was most noticeable in the <700m2 PSV and <8K BHP AAHTS. This can increase TDW’s pricing flexibility, especially once the demand increases again.

### Brent and WTI Crude

Brent and WTI crude oil prices have dropped substantially in the past two years. In 2022, both had prices soaring above $100 per barrel. But in the past year, we saw prices hitting the bottom at about $66-69 per barrel. This affected the demand for oil as it became less profitable for drillers and explorers. This also lowered the demand for OSVs, leading to lower utilization rates. But since December, we have seen prices making a comeback. Today, prices are over $70 and may reach $80 again since it plans to extend its [OPEC](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-likely-stick-oil-output-hike-plan-sources-say-2025-02-03/) plans to keep its oil output cut policies until March.

In April, outputs may ease again and affect oil prices. This can be another challenge for OSVs. On the flip side, this can help lower operating costs and operating leverage to stabilize margins.

### Global Economic Changes

Inflation is still a bit stubborn. In the US and the EU, for instance, inflation rebounded again by 0.2% to [2.9%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi) and [2.7%](https://tradingeconomics.com/european-union/inflation-rate), respectively. Despite this, the global economy shows more stability today than in 2022 and 2023. Interest rate cuts and lower unemployment are some trends. Recovery is still gradual but the global trajectory shows optimism. This year, we may expect improved demand across industries since the global GDP may increase by [3.3%](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/12/economic-outlook-global-growth-to-remain-resilient-in-2025-and-2026-despite-significant-risks.html) up from 3.2% in FY24. Exports and imports may increase again. This can lead to a lot of positive spillovers into energy commodities like oil. This can also push prices upward and boost OSV demand.

Price Ratios
------------

The price of TDW has increased substantially since the pandemic. We can attribute it to its notable expansion, solid operations, and increased demand for OSVs. Since the market is still facing uncertainties with the OSV demand, I decided to use Sales Per Share as a metric to assess the price. I also use FCF Per Share since I believe cash conversion after capex is crucial in its sustainability. Both convey that TDW is still cheap as it trades lower than its four-year historical average. While they do not actually reveal the intrinsic value of the stock, they still compare the historical valuation of TDW. We can also check how much the stock price changed relative to these metrics.

To prove their relationship, we did regression analysis for its performance over the past decade. Please note that it is lower than the standard number of observations. But in just a glance, the 80% correlation shows a direct relationship between price and these metrics. Meanwhile, the p-value of 0.005, which is lower than the maximum of 0.05 shows significant observations. This suggests that both sales and FCF have a high impact on stock price changes.

DCF Model
---------

To better check TDW’s intrinsic value, I also used the DCF Model. By projecting its performance for the next five years, we can also estimate the potential performance of the stock. It gave a TP of $74.30, which conveys a 34% upside potential.

As you can see, I set the perpetual growth rate at 1.00%. This is much lower than my estimation in other stocks. Typically, I use 2.00% to remain synchronized with the current inflation across the globe, particularly in the US. To be more conservative, I used a lower rate for several reasons. One, the OSV market is much more volatile than others. Two, many other factors can affect the companies in the industry. Three, increasing oil output may push oil prices downward and lower the demand for OSVs. Meanwhile, I derived WACC using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

Lastly, I derived the free cash flow to the firm or FCFF by estimating future revenues, operating costs, expenses, and depreciation to get the EBIT. I multiplied it by the current tax rate to get net operating profit after tax or NOPAT. From there, I adjusted my estimated depreciation, capex, and changes in net working capital.

Also note that even if further decrease the perpetual growth rate, the TP is still higher than the current price.

Technicals
----------

The momentum of TDW stays weak as price consolidation continues. I think this is warranted since investors await its Q424 results. In addition, the direction of oil prices and the OSV market may change in April due to OPEC’s plan and economic uncertainties from President Trump’s actions. Despite these, it may be a good time to take a position for this stock. At $54.91, the stock is trading near the 52-week historical low. We must also note the price is near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement, so an upside is highly possible.

Concerning its indicators, MACD shows a potential to regain momentum. For the past two weeks, it has been decreasing, a bit stationery, and below the signal line. Now, it shows a slight uptrend and is about to cross above the signal line. We can also see the increasing histogram.

Lastly, the RSI remains below the oversold region. At 52, there is still a chance the stock may increase by 24%. I think this is logical since it has historically reached at least 72 before having a pullback or a bearish reversal. Today, this indicator conveys consolidation. If we use the RSI to predict the price, the stock may reach $69.96. Coincidentally, this is near the 0.50 retracement point from its resistance to support.

Technical Analysis (TradingView)





Conclusion
----------

Tidewater, Inc. remains a solid company despite a softer market environment. It is well-positioned for uncertainties with its stable margins, efficiency, and impressive liquidity. In addition, its high market penetration and younger-than-average vessel age allow it to stay competitive. What’s more interesting is that is still cheap with a decent upside. So, I am recommending this stock as a good buy.
