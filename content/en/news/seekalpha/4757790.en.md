Investment Thesis
-----------------

Oregon-based coffee chain Dutch Bros (NYSE:[BROS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS "Dutch Bros Inc.")) is showing Starbucks ([SBUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX "Starbucks Corporation")) just how important it is to listen to what customers want and hustle for consumer appeal.

The Oregon-based coffee chain’s Q4 results were published yesterday, showing a robust uptick in comparable shop sales of almost 7% as [Dutch Bros customers continue to buy into the coffee chain's value proposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/17lvoh1/survey_why_do_you_like_dutch_brothers_more_than/) of innovative, customizable coffee beverages with friendly staff and prices that still remain fairly anchored versus other coffee chains.

Dutch Bros not only delivered another quarter of +30% growth in revenue and EBITDA, but it also projected a strong outlook that pleasantly caught many analysts by surprise, including myself.

As part of its 2025 growth goals, the coffee chain is doubling down on its shop expansion strategy across the US but yet expects to spend within reasonable means of its margin goals.

Despite the post-earnings jump, I expect additional upside in Dutch Bros over the next twelve months and continue to recommend a Buy rating on the coffee chain company.

Dutch Bros Q4 Shows How Sticky Coffee Chain Customers Can Be
------------------------------------------------------------

My last post on Dutch Bros was in July last year, where I noted that [customer traffic to Dutch Bros coffee shops was seeing significant upticks](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705105-dutch-bros-positive-takeaways-from-h1-traffic-data-investor-conferences) in foot traffic as compared to its peers.

 [![Author’s rating history on Dutch Bros.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441431635557.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441431635557_origin.png) 



Exhibit A: Author’s rating history on Dutch Bros. (Seeking Alpha)





At the time, what struck me was that Dutch Bros was seeing a significant uptick in its new stores without diluting the foot traffic to its existing stores. In other words, Dutch Bros was not only seeing the usual demand surge that beverage and restaurant chains see when they open new stores; the company was able to sustain the customers that it had acquired from other coffee stores in the area.

This was one of the main reasons why Dutch Bros was able to score [revenue growth of 35% to $342.8 million in Q4](https://investors.dutchbros.com/news/news-details/2025/Dutch-Bros-Inc.-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results/), beating Q4 expectations by $24 million, despite its system-wide same-shop sales growing 7% in the same quarter. For the year, Dutch Bros crossed its first billion dollars in revenues with 2024 sales of $1.28 billion, growing 32.6% y/y.

The 7% same-shop sales growth that the coffee chain registered in Q4 is also strong given that most of the industry grows its same-store sales in the low-mid digit range. Dutch Bros same-store sales look even more impressive given that the Goliath of the coffee chain market in the US, Starbucks, has been unable to revive its same-store sales. The same-store sales contraction that Starbucks continues to see implies market share wins for Starbucks, with Dutch Bros being one of the beneficiaries.

 [![Same store sales at Dutch Bros coffee stores keeps growing while Starbucks store sales keep contracting.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441518611603.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441518611603_origin.png)

[On the call to discuss earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757720-dutch-bros-inc-bros-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript), Dutch Bros management attributed the Q4 performance in store sales to strong traffic performance in Q4 to Dutch Bros, an observation I made in my previous report on Dutch Bros. An excerpt from the call:

> *We did see really strong traffic performance with the result of that with strong traffic performance, we're actually able to dial back some of our discount position as well and that allowed us to have some strong ticket flow through.*

This comment above by management portrays just how confident and observant management is at learning about their customers behaviors. They understood their coffee chain's products were in strong demand and moved to marginally dial down their promotional activity, reducing discounts offered, thus keeping the ASPs of their beverages stable.

And Dutch Bros CEO added that the momentum from the rollout of mobile ordering [that the company saw in Q3](https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com/Latest/News/2024/November/Mobile-ordering-drives-Dutch-Bros-third-quarter-sa) persisted in Q4, leading them to marginally pivot away from discounts:

> *I think the final factor I would add is we also saw strength in the morning [daypart]. So as we rolled out mobile order, the expectation was that, that would really benefit the morning a bit more and we saw that in the numbers.*

Management’s efforts to slow down promotional activity can be seen below, where SG&A as a percent of revenue declined by over 100 bp to 21.1% in Q4. At the same time, management has resiliently demonstrated its dexterity at handling costs by keeping labor cost pressures and Food and Beverage cost pressures under control. *(Food & Bev costs include the impact from coffee prices, which I will discuss in the Risks section.)*

 [![Dutch Bros cost profile stays under control leading to higher shop contribution margins.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394415896763191.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394415896763191_origin.png) 



Exhibit B: Dutch Bros cost profile stays under control leading to higher shop contribution margins. (Company filings)





The all-round performance by Dutch Bros led to the company reporting that adj. EBITDA grew 43.9% y/y to $230.3 million in 2024, implying adj. EBITDA margins of 18%, significantly ahead of the 16.2% margins I was expecting. GAAP net income was $66.5 million, or 34 cents a share, in 2024 versus 3 cents per share in 2023. On an adjusted basis, Dutch Bros earned 7 cents per share, significantly ahead of the 2 cents per share consensus estimate.

Dutch Bros Plans To Compete On Their Peers’ Home Turf
-----------------------------------------------------

With the robust demand that Dutch Bros saw in their business, management has set targets in 2025, which landed well ahead of the consensus estimates.

This year, Dutch Bros management will be aiming for $1.565 billion in revenues, growing 22% y/y at the midpoint of their guidance range, while full-year 2025 adj. EBITDA is projected to be ~$270 million. The financial targets are ahead of the 2025 consensus estimates for revenue to reach ~$1.54 billion.

There are two main ways management plans to do this. The first is pretty straightforward—ramping up the opening of more shops across the US. Management plans to open 160 shops, ~6% more than the 151 new shops they opened in 2024. That is going to require more capex. But management’s guide of ~$250 million capex is very reasonable for its growth plans, which keeps its depreciation and amortization in check, as seen in Exhibit B above.

The second path management is taking is to be strategically aggressive. On the call, management detailed how they were seeing an uptick in transactions during the morning shifts in their coffee shops, which I highlighted in an excerpt above by Dutch Bros CEO. Management is gunning for the *“opportunity to expand market share in the morning daypart”* and believes that the coffee chain's food pairings can play a big part in helping them gain market share.

Investors should note that Dutch Bros is not alone.

Starbucks [has recently announced their own plans](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752750-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript) to capture the share of morning coffee customers on their own earnings call last month, where they intend to scale transactions in the morning daypart.

As of now, it is mostly Dunkin' Donuts [that leads the share in the morning customer traffic](https://www.placer.ai/blog/coffee-fix-starbucks-and-dunkin-in-2024), as I have illustrated below.

 [![Dunkin Donuts leads the share of morning customer foot traffic and Dutch Bros Is keen on gaining share in this segment.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441744610133.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-1739441744610133_origin.png) 



Exhibit C: Dunkin Donuts leads the share of morning customer foot traffic and Dutch Bros Is keen on gaining share in this segment. (placer ai)





I believe Dutch Bros should be able to take some share in the morning customer foot traffic given the strong appeal that the coffee chain commands over the younger target audience.

Upgrading Dutch Bros Stock Price Targets
----------------------------------------

I am very encouraged by the current roster of Dutch Bros management and their efforts in winning share in a competitive market despite cost pressure headwinds. After following Dutch Bros management through last year, I believe they issue conservative external guidance and resort to a beat-and-raise style performance.

I believe Dutch Bros can deliver 2025 revenues of $1.568 billion, growing 22.4% this year, while adj. EBITDA can land at $272 million, growing; both my top and bottom line estimates are slightly ahead of management estimates due to the sharp uptick in revenue growth and adj. EBITDA management has already delivered last year.

I have estimated Dutch Bros' enterprise value to be ~$9.6 billion, which includes lease liabilities and debt of $942 million, cash+equivalents worth $293 million, and the overnight price increase of Dutch Bros stock, which was hovering at ~$80. The EV also includes shares outstanding of ~104 million, significantly higher than 2023’s base of 62.1 million.

The current forward NTM valuation for Dutch Bros implies an EV/EBITDA of ~35.2x 2025 EBITDA that is growing ~18%. Compared to Dutch Bros, its large peer Starbucks appears to be valued at 22.7x forward EBITDA.

 [![Dutch Bros valuation premium to rise to at least 40x 2025 adj. EBITDA.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394418292005541.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394418292005541_origin.png) 



Exhibit D: Dutch Bros valuation premium to rise to at least 40x 2025 adj. EBITDA. (yCharts)





On a like-for-like basis, Dutch Bros valuation levels have meaningful potential to expand from current levels. At the very least, the premium for Dutch Bros could expand to at least 41x, implying ~17-18% upside in the stock, implying a PT of ~$93.

Risks/Other Factors To Note
---------------------------

The larger threat to Dutch Bros here is the price of coffee for two reasons. One is the inherent risk of coffee prices that were already rising through 2024 and could potentially rise in 2025 further. Two is the rising global trade tensions between the US and Latin America, a huge source for US coffee companies to source their coffee beans from.

On the call, Dutch Bros explained that the elevated prices of coffee beans so far did not meaningfully impact margins, which I also illustrated in Exhibit B. In 2025, management’s projections implied that the current cost pressures from rising coffee bean prices would almost net zero to the company. Management expects to see an increase in Food & Bev costs due to rising coffee procurement costs, which will impact adj. EBITDA by ~75 bp. But management mentioned they can deliver ~80 bp of additional SG&A leverage in that case, which negates out the cost pressures from coffee bean prices.

 [![Coffee Bean Prices Remain Elevated at $4 per pound.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394418702714307.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59636229-17394418702714307_origin.png) 



Exhibit E: Coffee Bean Prices Remain Elevated at $4 per pound. (Markets Insider)





Management explained on the call that they have modeled for coffee bean prices to remain elevated at ~$4 per pound. In case cost prices stay elevated, management detailed that they can pivot to operational strategies where they use operating leverage to offset marginal or moderate price increases.

Here is how management framed their thinking about risk planning for increases in coffee bean prices:

> *We're assuming that it holds at about $4 for the balance. As we think about this longer term, history in the coffee market would suggest that these are temporary spikes that should not have a prolonged impact.*
> 
> *If, for some reason, the coffee prices were to be a more structural change, a more foundational change that were to be more persistent, certainly, there's other factors we could look at considering price being one and then potentially other offsets in the P&L.*

While runaway coffee prices are a big risk, the confidence and the extent of risk planning along with the generous details that Dutch Bros offered on the call are very reassuring to me.

The other minor threat is that the overnight surge in Dutch Bros stock price may lead to volatility. My Buy rating for the company is over a twelve-month horizon, so it is likely the stock may pull back shortly over the next few days/months from current levels. That would be an opportunity for investors to get in, per my view.

Takeaway
--------

My key takeaway from Dutch Bros’ Q4 earnings report and listening to management explaining their growth and risk mitigation strategies is—I'm very impressed with Dutch Bros management.

Dutch Bros is the David among many Goliaths in the coffee chain business. Yet, the company has navigated a choppy, competitive, cost-pressured, and volatile environment in the last two years to deliver consistent growth while guiding for impressive momentum for the next twelve months.

I reiterate my Buy rating on Dutch Bros.
