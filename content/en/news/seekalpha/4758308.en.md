The iShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF (NYSEARCA:[SMLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMLF "iShares U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor ETF")) is a fund that focuses on smaller capitalization companies in the U.S. market. This fund has a market cap profile that also includes a relevant allocation to mid caps, as opposed to other funds that are almost exclusively concentrated on small caps.

Based on a multifactor approach, SMLF’s portfolio exhibits a valuation multiple that is consistent with its relatively high profitability and growth profile. While the outlook remains positive for the U.S. economy, high interest rates should continue to pose a challenge for smaller capitalization companies. That said, it will be interesting to see whether [SMLF can continue to deliver strong returns](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693838-smlf-invest-in-small-caps-stocks-with-this-factor-etf), outperforming the Russell 2000 index and the peer group over time.

ETF Description & Highlights
----------------------------

SMLF is an ETF that provides exposure to U.S. smaller capitalization companies, tracking the index STOXX U.S. Small-Cap Equity Factor Index, which is designed to reflect a multifactor investment strategy including four factors: momentum, quality, value, and low volatility.

Starting from an eligible universe of companies included in the parent STOXX US Small Cap Index, a representation of the U.S. small-caps segment that accounts for the bottom 15% of the U.S. investable market capitalization, the index methodology assigns four scores to each parent index constituent. The momentum score measures prices and earnings momentum. The quality score takes into account metrics such as gross profitability, share dilution, net operation assets, carbon emissions, among other metrics. The value score is based on metrics such as book value-to-price ratio, dividend yield, earnings yield, and cash-flow yields, while the low volatility score is calculated based on the last twelve months' volatility.

Companies are then ranked and weighted in the index according to these scores, subject to some constraints to mitigate stock concentration, where no individual stock should exceed 10%, and stocks with individual weights above 4.5% cannot make up more than 22.5% of the index. In addition, other constraints are employed, including the index’s sector and country exposure compared to the parent index.

As of February 7, 2025, SMLF had $1.7 billion in assets under management, invested in a portfolio of 830 companies, with an average market cap of $6.4 billion. The allocation is heavily weighted towards smaller capitalization companies, with small caps and micro caps representing 51.1% and 19.4% of total assets, respectively, while mid caps account for 25.0%, and large caps 4.2%. This picture shows a slight shift of this fund toward large caps since my previous article covering SMLF last May, as allocation to large caps increased from 1.3% to 4.2% during this period, which is also evidenced by the fund’s average market cap growth from $4.7 billion to $6.4 billion.

A comparison to the Russell 2000 index, a well-known benchmark for small caps, represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWM "iShares Russell 2000 ETF")), shows the Russell 2000 index with a much stronger bias toward smaller capitalization companies, as the benchmark exposure to mid caps is quite modest at 3.2%, in contrast to 25% for SMLF.

SMLF’s top ten holdings are AppLovin (1.79%), MicroStrategy (0.93%), EMCOR (0.87%), Axon Enterprise (0.78%), Williams-Sonoma (0.67%), Jabil (0.63%), Carvana (0.60%), Monday.com (0.59%), Sprouts Farmers Market (0.58%), and Wix.com (0.58%), which together represent 6% of total assets. The fund has a strong presence in the technology sector, including five holdings (mobile app developer AppLovin, business intelligence and cloud computing firm MicroStrategy, electronics manufacturing solutions provider Jabil, cloud-based software provider Monday.com, and website development and e-commerce solutions provider Wix.com). Completing the top ten holdings, the fund has two holdings in industrials (infrastructure and construction services provider EMCOR and law enforcement and defense technology provider Axon Enterprise), with the remaining three from consumer discretionary (Williams-Sonoma and Carvana) and consumer staples (Sprouts Farmers).

The following table includes a list of small-cap funds that will serve as the benchmark for SMLF in the analysis. The first three (VB, SCHA, and IJR) are typical market cap-weight funds based on small-cap indexes, offering a broad representation of the small-cap universe. The first one is the Vanguard Small-Cap ETF ([VB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VB "Vanguard Small Cap ETF")), which provides exposure to the bottom 2% to 15% of the U.S. market capitalization, tracking the MSCI USA Small Cap index, and placing a relatively significant emphasis on mid caps as well. Next, the Schwab US Small-Cap ETF ([SCHA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHA "Schwab Strategic Trust - Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF")), concentrates on stocks ranked 751-2,500 by market cap, following the Dow Jones US Total Stock Market Small-Cap index. The iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF ([IJR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IJR "iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF")) focuses on a selection of 600 small-cap stocks, based on the S&P Small Cap 600 index.

The following three funds (JHSC, FYX, and GSSC) have a multifactor approach, similar to SMLF. The John Hancock Multifactor Small Cap ETF ([JHSC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JHSC "John Hancock Multifactor Small Cap ETF")) selects stocks primarily based on price and profitability metrics in a relatively concentrated portfolio of nearly 260 stocks. The First Trust Small Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF ([FYX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FYX "First Trust Small Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF")) employs a quantitative approach that integrates growth and value factors, while the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta US SmCp Eq ETF ([GSSC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSSC "Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF")) combines multiple investment factors seeking to enhance returns of its small-cap portfolios.

From a sector perspective, [SMLF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272825/ishares-msci-usa-small-cap-multi-factor-etf)'s largest allocation is to technology, accounting for 19.3% of total equities, followed by industrials (17.1%), financial services (15.0%), consumer discretionary (14.7%), healthcare (11.5%), real estate (6.6%), consumer staples (4.1%), energy (4.0%), basic materials (3.3%), communication services (2.5%), and utilities (1.9%). Compared to the SMLF’s allocation profile in my previous article for this fund in May 2024, there is a noticeable increase in the exposure to technology from 25.6% to 29.3%, while positions in energy and industrials dropped more than 1% each.

Relative to the Russell 2000 index, SMLF is overweight in consumer discretionary (+5.5%), technology (+3.6%), and industrials (+0.7%). The fund’s allocation to consumer discretionary is well-diversified, with a significant stance in core sub-sectors, such as specialty retail, apparel & luxury, and Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure. Meanwhile, SMLF’s exposure to technology, the fund’s largest sector, obviously reflects some of the fund’s top holdings like AppLovin and MicroStrategy, while it remains with a relevant stake in software, with a broad exposure to this industry.

On the other hand, SMLF is underweight in healthcare (-4.9%), financial services (-2.4%), and energy (-0.9%), as the fund takes a conservative approach to healthcare, with limited exposure to biotech, pharmaceuticals and managed healthcare to a lesser degree.

When compared to the peer group, SMLF is overweight in technology (+4.4%), and consumer discretionary (+1.6%), as peers, including the multifactor funds JHSC, FYX, and GSSC, follow the benchmark sector allocation for technology at nearly 15%. On the flip side, SMLF is underweight in financial services (-2.8%), and healthcare (-0.8%), driven by multi-factors funds’ aggressive stance in financial services, particularly JHSC.

Valuation Slightly Higher Than Benchmarks
-----------------------------------------

SMLF's average price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 16.5x represents a 3.7% premium to the Russell 2000 index, as the fund’s valuation multiple increased nearly 3.9% from 14.9x in May 2024 to current levels, while the Russell 2000 index P/E ratio remained unchanged at 14.9x. Overall, SMLF’s higher valuation relative to the Russell 2000 index reflects the fund’s overweight exposure to technology, but also its stock selection primarily in two sectors, technology, and industrials, particularly in software and aerospace & defense segments, which more than offset lower valuation in the consumer discretionary sector.

The fund’s historical and projected long-term earnings growth is marginally higher than that of the Russell 2000 index, thanks to substantial earnings growth in the technology and industrials sectors, particularly among smaller capitalization companies, which have outpaced the Russell 2000 index’s sector average. On the profitability side, SMLF’s average EBITDA margin of 15.1% is five percentage points higher than the Russell 2000 index, helped by EBITDA margins averaging 17% in SMLF’s mid-cap holdings within industrials and consumer discretionary sectors, while these two sectors combined in the Russell 2000 index have EBITDA margins of roughly 13%.

SMLF’s P/E ratio is roughly in line with the market cap-weighted funds in the peer group (VB, SCHA, and IJR), but it trades at a premium compared to multifactor funds, as these have only marginal exposure to mid-caps, while SMLF has 25% allocated in the segment. This plays an important role in SMLF’s valuation, as the P/E ratio of its mid-cap holdings is about 60% higher than its small- and micro-cap holdings.

Solid Returns Over The Past Years
---------------------------------

SMLF has delivered strong gains over the past four years, outperforming the Russell 2000 index each year by an annualized margin of nearly 4%. The fund has also outpaced the peer group, with the best returns most of the time among all funds in the group. SMLF’s volatility has been in line with the Russell 2000 index and most peers, with its beta ranging from 1.12 and 1.14, while multifactor funds JHSC and GSSC have had portfolios with marginally lower volatility, but still certainly higher than large-cap benchmarks like the S&P 500 index, whose beta of 1.0 serve as the reference for the overall market.

SMLF has a reasonable daily trading volume of $8.3 million, which is obviously much lower than those of the market cap-weight funds like VB, SCHA, and IHR, but still at least three times higher than multifactor funds JHSC, FYX, and GSSC. While SMLF’s trading volume is not as low, its average spread of 0.20% is high, similar to the less liquid fund JHSC and higher than GSSC. On the other hand, its expense ratio of 0.15% is surprisingly lower than other multifactor funds, in spite of its high turnover of over 100%. SMLF’s dividend yield of 1.28% is in line with most peers, as no fund in the peer group has a significant allocation gap in higher-yielding sectors like real estate, utilities, and energy. Lastly, SMLF’s tracking error of 10% and 12% is quite similar to peers, while its adjusted returns, as measured by its Sharpe ratio, in the range of 0.39 to 0.52, are by far the highest within the peer group, driven by the fund’s outperformance, while volatility remains similar to each other.

Final Thoughts
--------------

SMLF differentiates itself from other peers by allocating nearly one-quarter of its portfolio to so-called mid caps and maintaining an average market cap of $ 6.4 billion, while most funds in the peer group are virtually small caps pure plays, with the exception of the Vanguard Small Cap ETF ([VB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VB "Vanguard Small Cap ETF")), which also has a relevant allocation to mid caps.

While I would attribute some of the SMLF’s outperformance to its mid-caps exposure, given this equity class has shown better performance in the past years, with a nearly annualized 8% and 10% over the past 3 and 10% years, respectively, the fact is that SMLF has delivered stronger gains than mid-cap benchmarks as well.

That said, although SMLF trades at a premium to the Russell 2000 index and the peer group, my view if this valuation is largely justified, given its portfolio’s stronger profitability and slightly higher growth measures. On the flip side, in the context of a strong U.S. economy amid a robust labor market and mixed inflation readings, a measured approach is warranted for the equity market for the time being, as interest rates can remain high for an extended period, which is not the best setup for small caps in general.

In conclusion, my take is that SMLF offers a balanced mix of fair valuation, a portfolio with relatively high profitability, and a consistent track record, which are factors that translate into a favorable risk-reward profile for investors seeking outperformance in the long run.
