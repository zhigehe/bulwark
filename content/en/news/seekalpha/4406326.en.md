Oppenheimer reeled in estimates on Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) even though the investor focus has shifted to the stock being a physical AI play.

Analyst Colin Rusch and his team view Elon Musk's bid for Open AI as just a near-term distraction from other challenges. Rusch noted that the bid for OpenAI comes at a 38% discount to the AI company's capital raise level in last October. 

"We don't expect any meaningful discussions to develop. However, we see increasing risks to Street estimates for TSLA as EV and AV competition intensifies. We also believe CEO Musk's political activity has fans in certain circles, but that his public life risks alienating consumers and employees as the Trump administration tests the limits of its power."

The recent negative demand trends for Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) in California and Europe were highlighted. Rusch also pointed to the further evidence seen this week of autonomous vehicle technology maturing across the industry.

Oppenheimer kept a Perform rating in place on Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")).

Shares of Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) were down 5.7% in Tuesdays afternoon trading and were swapping hands at their lowest level since about 10 days after the U.S. election. Earlier in the day, BYD Company ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) shocked the EV sector by announcing new advanced driver-assistance features across most of its lineup for no extra cost.
