Zillow Group (NASDAQ:[Z](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Z "Zillow Group, Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[ZG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZG "Zillow Group, Inc.")) slid 6.1% in Tuesday after-hours trading after the company delivered Q1 2025 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA that missed the mark.

The online real estate platform expects Q1 revenue of $575M-$590M, trailing the $599.4M average analyst estimate. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $125M-$140M, also falling short of the $158.3M Visible Alpha consensus.

For the full year, it expects low-to-mid teens revenue growth, with room for further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. And positive GAAP net income is expected to be achieved for FY25.

Meanwhile, Q4 revenue of $554M, beating the $546.7M consensus, fell from $581.0M in Q3 and climbed from $474M a year earlier.

Adjusted EBITDA was $112M, down from $127M in the prior quarter and up from $69M in Q4 2023. The latest figure exceeds the $108.8M Visible Alpha estimate.
