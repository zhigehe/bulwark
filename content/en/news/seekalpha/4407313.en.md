### Management View

* CEO Mark Bristow highlighted a transformative year for Barrick, underpinned by investments in assets and personnel. EBITDA increased by 30% year-over-year, and adjusted net earnings per share rose 50% to $1.26. The company repurchased $354 million of shares in Q4, bringing the 2024 total to nearly $500 million.
* Gold production rose 15% quarter-over-quarter, with a 3% reduction in cost of sales and a 5% decrease in total cash costs. Nevada Gold Mines contributed significantly to the performance, meeting guidance with improved throughput and production.
* Copper production also reached record levels at the Lumwana mine, with Group attributable production guidance met for both copper and gold.
* CFO Graham Shuttleworth noted, "Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 18% to $1.4 billion, driving a 104% increase in full-year free cash flow to $1.3 billion for 2024."
* The company advanced its exploration and development pipeline, adding 12.7 million ounces of gold and 13 million tonnes of copper reserves from Lumwana and Reko Diq. The Fourmile project entered pre-feasibility with a $78 million budget for 2025.

### Outlook

* Barrick reaffirmed its projection of 30% growth in gold equivalent ounces by the end of the decade, supported by organic reserve additions and new project developments.
* The company plans to exceed 800,000 ounces of annual gold production at Pueblo Viejo in 2025, following plant recovery upgrades and tailings facility expansions.
* The Reko Diq project remains a cornerstone of future growth, with Phase 1 funding estimated at $5.6 billion to $6 billion. First production is targeted by the end of 2028, with significant upside potential from 14 identified porphyry bodies.
* Guidance adjustments for 2025 will reflect ongoing operational shifts, with sustained focus on balancing growth capital and operational efficiency.

### Financial Results

* Free cash flow doubled year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while net debt remained stable at $650 million. Shareholder returns included $700 million in dividends and $500 million in share buybacks.
* Quarterly dividend was maintained at $0.10 per share.
* Total attributable gold production increased 15% quarter-over-quarter, driven by operational gains in North America and Africa.
* Adjusted net earnings per share climbed to $1.26, aided by cost reductions and higher realized gold prices.
* Record copper production at Lumwana and strong performance at Veladero and Pueblo Viejo highlighted operational improvements.

### Q&A

* Brian MacArthur, Raymond James: Questioned the rationale behind the reduction in capital expenditures and its breakdown. CFO Shuttleworth clarified that the majority of reductions were related to Loulo exclusion, with minor adjustments in Nevada.
