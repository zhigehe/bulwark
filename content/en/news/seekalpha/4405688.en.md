ETFs in the metals and mining sector surged Monday after President Trump said the U.S. will [impose new 25% tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405527-steel-aluminum-stocks-jump-as-trump-to-set-25-percent-tariffs "impose new 25% tariffs") on all steel and aluminum imports, on top of existing metals duties.

The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSEARCA:[XME](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XME "SPDRÂ® S&P Metals and Mining ETF")) recently was +3.5%, on pace for its largest daily percentage advance since November 6, according to Dow Jones Market Data, while the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (NYSEARCA:[IYM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IYM "iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF")) and the iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF ([PICK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PICK "iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF")) were both +1%.

Among steelmakers: Cleveland-Cliffs ([CLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLF "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.")) +13.9%, Nucor ([NUE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUE "Nucor Corporation")) +5.9%, Steel Dynamics ([STLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLD "Steel Dynamics, Inc.")) +5.2%, US Steel ([X](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X "United States Steel Corporation")) +4%, Commerical Metals ([CMC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMC "Commercial Metals Company")) +3%.

Among aluminum producers: Century Aluminum (CNEX) +10.5%, Alcoa ([AA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AA "Alcoa Corporation")) +3%, Kaiser Aluminum ([KALU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KALU "Kaiser Aluminum Corporation")) +2.3%.

U.S. imports ~25% of its steel supply, with 80% tariff free due to agreements with Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Brazil, and analysts at Citi [said](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-partial-recovery-from-friday-s-losses/card/citi-estimates-the-boost-to-steel-and-aluminum-prices-from-25-tariffs-UVmWirqWkHUcx5rMIcQR "said") a 25% tariff would add ~$150/ton to the import price of steel and put hot rolled steel prices on par with European prices.

For aluminum, the U.S. imports 70% of its supply, with 60% of it tariff free from Canada, and the tariffs would take Midwest Premium costs up to $0.40 from the current $0.28, Citi said.
