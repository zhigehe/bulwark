Investment environment
----------------------

Equity markets extended gains in the fourth quarter, building on strong performance through the first nine months of 2024. U.S. and global economic activity remained relatively solid, and earnings continued to grow for many companies. The November election sparked a strong rally fueled by expectations of reduced regulation and potentially lower corporate tax rates under the Trump administration. However, stocks faced December volatility as investors grew wary about the feasibility of the administration’s policy proposals. The Fed cut policy rates by 25 basis points in both November and December but indicated fewer cuts were likely in 2025. The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y)) ended the quarter higher on increased economic growth and inflation expectations. Market gains reflected a narrow advance: only four of 11 S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500), [SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX)) sectors posted gains; the equal-weighted S&P 500 lagged its market cap counterpart; and the Magnificent 7 tech stocks significantly outperformed the broader market.

Portfolio review
----------------

Semiconductor company Marvell Technology ([MRVL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL "Marvell Technology, Inc.")) was a top contributor to relative performance. The company's third-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Its expanded partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), driven by the growth of Amazon’s ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) next generation Trainium AI chip, strengthened Marvell’s market position in AI semiconductors.

Madrigal Pharmaceuticals ([MDGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDGL "Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) was also among the top contributors. The company is focused on developing therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), or fatty liver disease, which affects over 10 million adults in the U.S. and is a leading cause of liver failure. Madrigal reported third-quarter revenues for MASH treatment Rezdiffra that doubled consensus expectations. The company also achieved its 80% commercial coverage goal earlier than expected. Finally, shares responded positively after Novo Nordisk ([NVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO "Novo Nordisk A/S")) reported modest efficacy for its GLP-1 drug semaglutide for MASH, possibly bringing the pharma giant’s marketing prowess to build the MASH market while still leaving room for Rezdiffra to augment activity.

UnitedHealth Group ([UNH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated")), a health insurance and services company, was among the top relative detractors. Shares fell following CEO Brian Thompson’s tragic death in Manhattan and the ensuing backlash against the managed care industry. Despite this negative sentiment, the company maintained its 2025 guidance, and we believe UnitedHealth shows potential for growth in Medicare Advantage, where it faces reduced competition. Further, we believe its investment in AI coupled with its extensive database, positions the company well for future efficiency gains.

ASML Holding ([ASML](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML "ASML Holding N.V.")), a semiconductor equipment company, also weighed on performance. The stock declined after the company’s third-quarter earnings release showed new bookings below expected levels. While management lowered 2025 guidance due to uncertainty around China sales restrictions, the company maintained its long-term outlook.

We continue to see opportunity tied to ASML’s strong competitive positioning and the growing AI-driven demand for equipment to produce high-end components.

Manager outlook
---------------

Market conditions remain favorable as we enter 2025, supported by the Federal Reserve's accommodative shift with rate cuts in this cycle totaling 100 basis points thus far. While monetary policy is still restrictive, this move toward a more neutral stance, combined with moderate inflation, has generally been positive for risk assets, despite ongoing debate about the pace of future rate cuts.

The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience with sturdy GDP growth projected into next year and a strong labor market supporting consumer spending. Earlier concerns about a potential hard landing have largely dissipated, with discussions now centered on the likelihood of either a soft landing or no-landing scenario.

Further, the election results and the Trump administration's pro-growth policies have been viewed as market friendly. We anticipate an environment conducive to increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity and investment, supported by deregulation initiatives.

Importantly, a broad array of secular trends remain firmly intact and has continued to dictate market direction. We are seeing unprecedented levels of capital investment across multiple areas of the economy, particularly in AI infrastructure. Rising consumer adoption and demand for AI products and services could benefit companies in several sectors, from semiconductor chip makers and data centers to companies powering data centers and consumer-facing companies that engineer AI applications.

While generative AI leads the way, powerful sector drivers are also continuing in deglobalization, power generation, and digitization. These themes are creating opportunities tied to growth in domestic manufacturing, utility infrastructure development, e-commerce, and digital payments.

We maintain a constructive outlook but are mindful of elevated market valuations and that speculative areas of the market, like cryptocurrency, have spiked on election enthusiasm. Market breadth has narrowed considerably, with leadership concentrated among the largest technology companies.

While we continue to monitor market and macroeconomic trends, our primary focus remains on evaluating companies’ business models and identifying competitively advantaged companies in healthy, growing end markets.

Returns greater than one year are annualized. Returns are expressed in U.S. dollars. All returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.  High absolute short-term performance is not typical and may not be achieved in the future. Such results should not be the sole basis for evaluating material facts in making an investment decision.  \*Pure gross performance results do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs, fees or expenses and returns will be reduced by such advisory fee and other contractual expenses as described in the individual contract and Form ADV Part 2A. Pure gross returns are supplemental to net returns.  Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable Managed Account fee (3.00% annually, or 0.25% monthly) from the pure gross or gross composite return. The Managed Account fee includes all charges for trading costs, portfolio management, custody and other administrative fees. Actual fees may vary depending on, among other things, the applicable fee schedule and portfolio size. The fees are available on request and may be found in Form ADV Part 2A. |

Concentrated Growth Managed Account Composite, benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Growth Index, includes portfolios that take concentrated positions in larger well-established companies along with smaller, more aggressive companies selected for their growth potential. A typical portfolio concentrates its investments in 30 to 40 equity securities. Prior to September 1, 2006 returns for the composite are for the Institutional Concentrated Growth Composite, which consisted of separately managed institutional accounts as well as sub-advised pooled funds. The composite was created in September 2006.  Information relating to portfolio holdings is based on the representative account in the composite, which reflects the typical portfolio management style of the investment strategy. Other accounts in the strategy may vary due to asset size, client guidelines and other factors.  Portfolio holdings are as of the date indicated, and are subject to change. This material should not be construed as recommendation to buy or sell any security. Holdings are subject to change without notice.  For equity portfolios, relative contribution compares the performance of a security in the portfolio to the benchmark’s total return, factoring in the difference in weight of that security in the benchmark.

No investment strategy can ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.  **Actively managed investment portfolios** are subject to the risk that the investment strategies and research process employed may fail to produce the intended results.
