Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:[AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:[ARM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARM "Arm Holdings plc")) both gained ground in microprocessor market share, while Intel (NASDAQ:[INTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC "Intel Corporation")) slipped, during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Citi analysts citing data by Mercury Research.

Intel shares were up about 4% by noon trading on Wednesday, while Arm and AMD had slipped 1.5% and 1%, respectively.

Total fourth quarter MPUs shipments increased 10.8% quarter over quarter. AMD's unit share increased to 22.1% from 21.6% quarter over quarter, rising due to notebook and server demand. Arm's unit share edged up to 10.5% from 10%, which also increased due to notebook demand.

Although Intel's market share decreased quarter over quarter by 1.4 percentage points, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker still dominated market share at 67.4%. However, Citi noted the percentage is the lowest for Intel in its model's history, which stretches back to 2002.

Intel's desktop share increased nearly 2 percentage points to 68.1%, but slower notebook and server shipments lowered its market share overall.

"Notebook MPU shipments were up 8.2% QoQ, above seasonality of down 0.5% QoQ and Desktop MPU shipments were up 20.0% QoQ, well above seasonality of down 1.7% QoQ due to our belief of an inventory build," said Citi analysts, led by Christopher Danely, in a Wednesday investor note. "Server MPU shipments were up 7.0% QoQ, below seasonality of up 7.8% QoQ."

Citi maintained its Neutral rating on both AMD and Intel, with price targets of $110 and $21, respectively.
