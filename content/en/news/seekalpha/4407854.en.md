The Canada-based artificial intelligence firm Cohere is the latest AI startup facing a civil suit for alleged copyright and trademark infringement.

The suit was filed on Thursday morning in the [Southern District of New York](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/ "Southern District of New York").

Some of the plaintiffs include Advance Local Media, the Atlantic, Forbes Media, the Guardian, Newsday, Insider, Politico, Vox, the Los Angeles Times and the Toronto Star, according to the filing.

"This is a lawsuit to protect journalism from systematic copyright and trademark infringement," reads the filing, which is Case 1:25-cv-01305. "Rather than create its own content, Cohere takes the creative output of Publishers, some of the largest, most enduring, and most important news, magazine, and digital publishers in the United States and around the world."

"Without permission or compensation, Cohere uses scraped copies of our articles, through training, real-time use, and in outputs, to power its artificial intelligence service, which in turn competes with Publisher offerings and the emerging market for AI licensing," the suit reads. "Not content with just stealing our works, Cohere also blatantly manufactures fake pieces and attributes them to us, misleading the public and tarnishing our brands."

However, Cohere, which is backed by some significant tech companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), Oracle (NYSE:[ORCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL "Oracle Corporation")) and Salesforce (NYSE:[CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM "Salesforce, Inc.")), contends it utilizes responsible systems for training its AI models.

"Cohere strongly stands by its practices for responsibly training its enterprise AI," said a Cohere spokesperson in an email to Seeking Alpha. "We have long prioritized controls that mitigate the risk of IP infringement and respect the rights of holders. We would have welcomed a conversation about their specific concerns–and the opportunity to explain our enterprise-focused approach–rather than learning about them in a filing. We believe this lawsuit is misguided and frivolous, and expect this matter to be resolved in our favor."

The lawsuit is the latest in a string of suits involving AI companies and publishers.

Back in [December 2023](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4050472-new-york-times-sues-microsoft-openai-over-copyright-infringement "December 2023"), The New York Times Company (NYSE:[NYT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NYT "The New York Times Company")) sued Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) and OpenAI for copyright infringement on Wednesday, alleging the companies illegally used the newspaper's content to train artificial intelligence models. This followed a similar suit by George R.R. Martin, John Grisham and other authors over alleged copyright infringement.

Amazon-backed ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) Anthropic also faced a [class-action lawsuit](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4142168-google-amazon-backed-anthropic-faces-copyright-lawsuit-over-ai-models-training "class-action lawsuit"), which was filed last August in California federal court by three authors who alleged that the San Francisco-based company misused their books and hundreds of thousands of others to train its AI chatbot Claude.

In October 2024, the News Corp's ([NWS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWS "News Corporation"))([NWSA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWSA "News Corporation")) *Wall Street Journal* and *New York Post* filed a case for copyright infringement against Perplexity AI, a generative AI search engine.
