Earnings Call Insights: Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:[NSP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSP "Insperity, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Paul Sarvadi highlighted that adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $0.05, with adjusted EBITDA at $23 million, surpassing the midpoint of expectations. Paid worksite employees totaled 309,093, slightly above the low end of forecasts but down 2% year-over-year due to weak client hiring.
* The company achieved a 37% increase in worksite employees paid from new clients compared to Q4 2023, with client retention remaining strong at 99%. Sarvadi emphasized that the fall sales and client retention campaign facilitated a record 8% increase in booked sales compared to the prior year.
* Gross profit per worksite employee was $235 per month, consistent with the prior year, but total gross profit fell 2% year-over-year due to the worksite employee decline.
* CFO Jim Allison noted that operating expenses grew 17% year-over-year, largely due to investments in the Workday strategic partnership. Insperity allocated $57 million in third-party costs and internal resources for the partnership in 2024.
* Sarvadi announced the upcoming launch of Insperity’s corporate tenant on the Workday platform on April 1, 2025, marking a critical milestone in the strategic partnership. This integration is expected to enhance client retention, particularly in the mid-market segment.

### Outlook

* Full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA is projected between $240 million and $285 million, with adjusted EPS expected to range from $3.10 to $3.95. These projections incorporate operating expense control and continued investment in strategic initiatives.
* The company forecasts paid worksite employee growth of 2-4% year-over-year, with sequential quarterly growth anticipated beyond Q1 2025 at 1.5-2%. Q1 2025 projections include 306,500 to 309,000 worksite employees, representing a 0.9-1.7% year-over-year increase.
* Benefits cost trends are expected to rise to 5-6.5% in 2025, higher than the 4.3% observed in 2024. Pricing has been adjusted upward to align with these trends.
* Sarvadi emphasized ongoing sales optimization and specialization across three core HR solutions, including the PEO solution, traditional employment services, and the mid-market opportunity.
