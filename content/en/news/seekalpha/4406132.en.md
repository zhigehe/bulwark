President Trump is likely to embrace the Medicare drug price negotiations that was initiated under the Biden administration, though the president could make some tweaks to put his own spin on it.

The price negotiations are included as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed in 2022. The first 10 drugs subject to negotiations will see reduced prices in 2026.

Speaking in New York City Tuesday at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference, SVP, Policy and Government Negotiations for Alkermes ([ALKS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALKS "Alkermes plc")) Pete Norman said that the administration may want negotiations to be more transparent going forward and make it look like a "real-world negotiation."

Trump may also want to embrace negotiations but do it in his own way, according to Remy Brin, principal, health care practice head at BGR Government Affairs. There are "rumblings on what are some easy wins to lower patient out-of-pocket costs," she said. The administration is "looking for things to take a victory lap on."

SVP, External Affairs and Head, Patient Advocacy Center of Excellence at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization ("BIO") Michele Osham noted that patients really care about out-of-costs. She added that Trump may see the Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation provision as "a Biden thing" and say "I can negotiate better."

The panel also discussed the potential impact of budget cuts on the U.S. FDA. Lindsay Androski, president and CEO of Roivant Social Ventures, said that a decline in resources could prompt greater efficiency and could also lead to the agency embracing more technological advancements when evaluating drugs.

Brim noted that while the FDA in the past might have been more risk adverse in approving drugs, there's going to be a push to go the other way, as the agency in the future isn't likely to decline to put a medicine on the market that could have a potential benefit.
