Shopify (NYSE:[SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")) reported better than expected fourth fiscal quarter results Wednesday, and the e-Commerce company submitted a decent outlook for Q1'25. Shopify booked double-digit growth in gross merchandise volume, a key metric for e-Commerce companies, and reported strong free cash flow as well as an improvement in FCF margins in the fourth fiscal quarter. As much as I like Shopify's performance in Q4'24, which was supported by seasonal spending tailwinds, I see shares of the e-Commerce platform as slightly more than fairly valued and don't see that much upside left on the table for growth investors.

**Previous rating**
-------------------

Shopify was a hold for me in my last work on the e-Commerce platform -- [Likely Fairly Valued -](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737973-shopify-likely-fairly-valued-rating-downgrade "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737973-shopify-likely-fairly-valued-rating-downgrade")- mainly due to valuation considerations. Shares of Shopify also performed very strongly in the last year, gaining more than 35% on strong GMV and revenue growth, so a lot of valuation gains have already happened. Although I liked Shopify's results for the fourth-quarter, I believe shares don't have much revaluation potential, and I would only recommend Shopify as a buy in case I could buy them at a price below my $100 fair value estimate.

Shopify beats estimates, strong GMV gains, long term growth potential
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The fourth-quarter is typically a good one for e-Commerce companies, as they sell more products and services during the holiday period. As a result, Shopify beat top and bottom-line estimates for the fourth fiscal quarter: Shopify earned $0.44 per-share in adjusted earnings, beating the average prediction by $0.01 per-share. The top line was reported at $2.81B, which surpassed the consensus estimate by $84M.

Seeking Alpha





Shopify generated strong GMV and top line growth in the fourth-quarter due to the inclusion of the Christmas holiday period. The e-Commerce platform had total gross merchandise volume/GMV of $94.5B, showing 26% year-over-year growth. Gross merchandise volume represents the total monetary value processed through the Shopify platform, and is therefore a key performance metric for e-Commerce companies in general. Full-year GMV increased 24% Y/Y to $292.3B and both of Shopify's segments achieved double-digit growth, driving by strong retail merchant demand for the platform's services.

Shopify





Both of Shopify's core segments, Subscription and Merchant Solutions, maintained growth rates above 20% Y/Y: in Q4'24, Subscriptions Solutions, which is mainly concerned with selling monthly subscription plans, grew revenue to $666M (+27% Y/Y) while Merchant Solutions, the biggest segment in terms of dollars, generated $2,146M in revenue (+33% Y/Y). Shopify, as a result, also saw a significant boost to its gross profits in the fourth-quarter: gross profits surged 27% year-over-year to $1,352M.

The long term trend in gross profits for Shopify is favorable and shows improving platform profitability...

Shopify has long-term potential to grow its top line, and the fact that a company of this size -- Shopify has a market cap of $156B -- can grow its revenue at more than 20% is impressive. Retail sales are growing, but the penetration rate of e-Commerce is still pretty low.

A penetration rate measures the share of e-Commerce sales as a percentage of all retail sales, and therefore shows how much more potential e-Commerce platforms have in terms of growing their share of the revenue pie.

Based on Shopify presentation materials, which are based off of eMarketer information, it is estimated that the e-Commerce penetration rate was only 16% in the fourth quarter, in the important North American market, leaving plenty of growth for companies like Shopify.

**Improving free cash flow margins**
------------------------------------

Shopify generated $611M in free cash flow in Q4'24 (+37% Y/Y) on revenue of $2.8B (+31% Y/Y) which means free cash flows grew ~6 PP faster than Shopify's top line in the holiday quarter. Free cash flow margins also expanded (+3 PP Q/Q) to 22% making Q4'24 the most profitable quarter for Shopify from a free cash flow perspective in the last year.

    | **in $M** | **Q4'23** | **Q1'24** | **Q2'24** | **Q3'24** | **Q4'24** | **Growth Y/Y** |
| GMV | $75,125 | $60,855 | $67,245 | $69,715 | $94,460 | 26% |
| Revenue | $2,144 | $1,861 | $2,045 | $2,162 | $2,812 | 31% |
| Free Cash Flow | $446 | $232 | $333 | $421 | $611 | 37% |
| FCF Margin | 21% | 12% | 16% | 19% | 22% | 4% |

**Decent outlook for Q1'25**
----------------------------

The e-Commerce platform expects to grow its revenue in the mid-twenties percentage range Y/Y in Q1'25 which is kind of what investors expected.

**Shopify's valuation**
-----------------------

Shopify is very highly valued and has been so for a while. Investors have been willing to value the e-Commerce company highly due to expectations of durable top line growth in the rapidly expanding e-Commerce market. Currently, shares of Shopify are valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 63.6X, which is about 21% above the longer term, 3-year average P/E ratio of 52.7X.

Shopify's valuation ratio compares against a forward P/E ratio of 30.2X for Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), the world's largest e-Commerce site. Alibaba ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")), a large Chinese e-Commerce platform, is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.2X. Alibaba is the cheapest large-scale e-Commerce enterprise here largely because the company operates out of China, and U.S. investors especially have been highly cautious about investing here after the CCP's crackdown on tech companies in 2020.

In my last work on Shopify, I saw a fair value of ~$100 per-share, based off of the company's historical P/E ratio. A ~53X average P/E ratio applied to a consensus estimate for FY 2026 earnings of $1.90 per-share yields a hypothetical fair value of $100.70 per-share.... so my fair value is not changing very much after the company's Q4'24 earnings scorecard. Since shares currently trade at $120, I see Shopify slightly overvalued.

However, given Shopify's consistently strong GMV growth, FCF margin expansion and solid long-term potential in the e-Commerce industry, I am not willing to change my rating from hold at this point. I would consider buying into the e-Commerce company in case the price of Shopify's shares drops below my fair value estimate.

**Risks with Shopify**
----------------------

The biggest risk for the e-Commerce platform would likely be a slowdown in Merchant Solutions-related revenue growth because this is by far the largest segment for Shopify (it is 3.2X as big in terms of revenue as Subscriptions Solutions). Another risk relates to potentially growing friction between the U.S. and other countries, especially China, in terms of trade. New tariffs between these two countries could impact Shopify's GMV and top line growth negatively. What may get me to change my mind about Shopify's shares, and my rating, is if the company were to see an acceleration of top line growth or higher free cash margins.

Final thoughts
--------------

I do see a lot of potential for Shopify going forward, especially as e-Commerce transactions are only going to grow and e-Commerce companies grow their penetration rates. Shopify delivered a solid earnings report card and outlook for Q1'25, and I especially liked the company's GMV surge and free cash flow margin expansion. However, I believe that Shopify's potential for growth is currently fully reflected in the e-Commerce company's market valuation, and I don't see much upside potential left at the current price.
