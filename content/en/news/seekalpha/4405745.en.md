Corporate sentiment is at its highest level recorded since 2004, according to Bank of America’s Predictive Analysis team.

The team analyses earnings call transcripts to calculate sentiment for S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) companies that have reported since March 31, 2020. They use the Loughran McDonald’s financial dictionary to calculate sentiment scores, which takes into account the number of unique positive words minus the number of unique negative words in earnings calls.

BofA's Corporate Sentiment Score soared to the highest level in its history, which started recording in 2004. This indicator has led S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) EPS year-over-year, with 69% correlation with a quarter lead, “suggesting a continued upcycle in earnings,” said Ohsung Kwon, Securities Equity & Quant strategist at BofA, in a note.

Companies’ optimism jumped to the highest level since the first quarter of 2021, with 52% of the companies – so far – expressing optimism during their earnings calls, compared to 46% last quarter.

“Mentions of ‘better’ or ‘stronger’ vs. ‘worse’ or ‘weaker’ also jumped to the highest level since 4Q21, showing signs of improvement,” Kwon said.

Interestingly, mentions of the word “bottom” have jumped 24% year-over-year. This is the biggest jump in history.

According to BofA data, “rising ‘bottom’ mentions have historically marked an inflection in the EPS cycle, suggesting a potential earnings recovery in cyclically depressed sectors ahead.”
