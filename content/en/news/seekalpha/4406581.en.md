### Management View

* CEO Gianfranco Ferrari highlighted record profitability of PEN5.5 billion for 2024 and an ROE of 16.5%, aligning with adjusted expectations of 17.2%, excluding one-off charges related to the Sartor case. He underscored robust operational performance, with improved cost of risk and increased lending at BCP and Mibanco. Exceptional transactional volumes at Yape and FX businesses contributed significantly to revenue diversification.
* Ferrari emphasized the strategic shift to achieve 10% of risk-adjusted revenues from new businesses by 2026, driven by innovation and digital transformation. He noted a stronger economic environment in Peru, with GDP growing 3% in 2024, inflation falling to a four-year low of 2.2%, and improved external accounts.
* CFO Alejandro Perez-Reyes reported that net interest income rose 1.1%, supported by growth in low-cost deposits representing 56.4% of the funding base. He also noted a 7.2% increase in insurance underwriting results and emphasized asset quality improvements, with the NPL ratio dropping 60 basis points to 5.3%.

### Outlook

* Credicorp projects Peru's GDP to grow around 3% in 2025, driven by controlled inflation, real wage recovery, and high terms of trade. Management expects total loans to grow 3.5% in average daily balances, equivalent to 6% quarter-end growth.
* The company targets a stable NIM between 6.2% and 6.5% and cost of risk guidance of 2% to 2.4% for 2025. Fee income growth is expected to reach low double digits, supported by accelerating activity and diversified revenue streams.
* Credicorp reaffirms its ROE target of 17.5% for 2025 and aims to achieve a sustainable 18% ROE by 2026 as digital initiatives mature.

### Financial Results

* Reported ROE for Q4 was 13.3%, impacted by a PEN259 million one-off provision related to the Sartor case. Adjusted ROE stood at 17.2% for the year.
* Loans grew 0.7% in average daily balances and 2.2% in quarter-end balances, driven by corporate, SME, and mortgage loans. The cost of risk improved to 2.1%, reflecting better payment performance and risk management.
* Noninterest income rose, supported by a 29.4% increase in FX transaction gains. Digital initiatives like Yape contributed significantly, with nearly 14 million active users and exponential growth in transaction volumes.

### Q&A

* Ernesto Gabilondo, Bank of America: Inquired about the impact of Peru's upcoming elections on loan growth. CEO Ferrari explained it is too early to predict, but the company expects growth above the market's 5.5% projection for 2025, citing improved macro conditions.
* Renato Meloni, Autonomous Research: Asked about asset quality as credit origination policies relax. Ferrari highlighted improved macro conditions and better-performing new vintages as drivers of confidence in maintaining asset quality.
* Brian Flores, Citibank: Questioned provisions related to the Sartor case. CFO Perez-Reyes stated PEN259 million was provisioned, representing the expected economic impact, and further charges are not anticipated.
* Tito Labarta, Goldman Sachs: Queried about efficiency given Yape’s profitability. Perez-Reyes noted investments in innovation and technology remain priorities, with Yape's cost-to-income ratio still above the corporate average.
