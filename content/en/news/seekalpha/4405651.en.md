Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) is under the scrutiny of French antitrust authority over concerns that the tech major is degrading the quality of search results for smaller rivals that pay to use Bing technology in their own search-engine products, *Bloomberg* reported on Monday. 

The French antitrust authority is weighing if Microsoft has abused its power in the niche market for search-engine syndication and has quizzed rival operators, people familiar with the matter told *Bloomberg*.

While Microsoft's Bing does not have a dominant position in the general search engine market, it remains a major player in the market for syndication. Smaller search engines like DuckDuckGo, Qwant, and Ecosia rely on Bingâ€™s search results for their businesses.
