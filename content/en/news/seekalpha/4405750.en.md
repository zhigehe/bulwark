### Management View

* Selwyn Joffe, Chairman and CEO, highlighted record sales, gross margin improvement, and strong cash flow generation during the quarter. He emphasized profitability initiatives, including gross margin expansion and working capital neutralization, resulting in $34.4M of cash generated from operating activities.
* The company reduced net debt by $30.3M, achieving a 26% reduction to $84M. Additionally, Motorcar Parts repurchased 268,130 shares for $2.1M under its buyback program.
* Rotating electrical, the flagship category, continues to deliver strong performance despite market softness. Emerging brake-related products are gaining traction, with expectations for increased demand during the spring repair season. These products are contributing to purchasing and production efficiencies, supporting gross margin improvement.
* Joffe reiterated the company’s long-term focus on non-discretionary aftermarket parts, supported by the aging vehicle fleet where the average age now exceeds 12.8 years. The company remains committed to expanding its product offerings, including brake calipers, brake pads, and rotors.
* CFO David Lee detailed net sales growth of 8.3% year-over-year to a record $186.2M and a 49.4% increase in gross profit to $44.9M. Gross margin improved to 24.1%, up from 17.5% in the prior year.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated its goal of achieving $100M in diagnostic equipment sales over the next three years. Additional service-related revenue is expected as more testers are deployed, with opportunities expanding outside North America.
* The company anticipates continued growth in brake-related product sales and other emerging categories, supported by operational efficiencies and market dynamics.
* Interest rate trends remain a positive factor, with lower rates expected to benefit profitability moving forward. Management also cited plans to reduce reliance on peso forward contracts by funding Mexican operations with local sales revenue.

### Financial Results

* Cash flow from operations reached $34.4M, largely attributed to strong operating profits and working capital improvements.
* Gross profit rose to $44.9M, with gross margin improvement driven by higher sales volume, increased production efficiencies, and purchasing initiatives. Non-cash expenses impacted gross profit by $3.4M, reflecting core and finished goods premium amortization and revaluation adjustments.

### Q&A

* Derek Soderberg, Cantor Fitzgerald, asked about the potential impact of tariffs on the business. Selwyn Joffe noted that while tariff surcharges are being implemented, the company’s reduced dependence on China mitigates exposure.
* Soderberg also inquired about gross margin expansion. Joffe attributed the improvement to production efficiencies, automation initiatives, and the relocation of operations to Mexico.
