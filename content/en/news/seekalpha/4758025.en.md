**Labcorp Holdings Inc.** (NYSE:[LH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LH "Labcorp Holdings Inc.")) is the world leader in life sciences and diagnostics, offering a holistic range of services including clinical laboratory services, drug development solutions, and diagnostics testing. It directly services end patients, as well as healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. I believe Labcorp is managing its financials very well, executing strategic decisions very efficiently, and is now focusing on its core strengths marching towards long-term growth. My valuation suggests a one-year target price of $245 per share, which aligns with the current price. Thus, I am initiating a “Hold” rating to Labcorp.

**Competitive Advantages**
--------------------------

Labcorp has a leading position in the diagnostics industry with over 27% of the market share. I think its strong competitive position mainly comes from a few factors.

* Scale. Labcorp is one of the largest clinical labs networks in the US. It provides laboratory services through more than 2,000 patient services centers and hospital partnerships, performs about 500 million test a year across US and the global. Such large scale enables market impact, better brand recognition and reputation, stronger bargaining and pricing power, and easier to achieve operation efficiency and cost reduction.
* Diversified Business. Labcorp provides a broad range of services, including some high-complexity testing, and Central Lab Services. Unlike its main competitor, Quest Diagnostics ([DGX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DGX "Quest Diagnostics Incorporated")), that focuses on Direct-to-Consumer testing, Labcorp also serves institutional clients such as hospitals, research centers, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and has been taken a more active and pioneering role in many new drug developments. For example, it worked on over 84% of new drugs approved by the FDA in FY2023. I think this diversified business model brings Labcorp more revenue streams, Biopharma segment also brings in higher margin compared to routine lab tests, thus enhancing shareholder values.
* Strong Industry Relationships. Labcorp has established deep roots in the industry, it owns many long-term contracts with major insurance companies and public healthcare systems, in some cases, exclusive partnerships with hospital networks. The relationships ensure Labcorp’s future stable revenue inflow, and strengthen Labcorp’s expertise working with government agencies, healthcare providers and pharma companies.
* Operational Efficiency and Cost Advantage. Labcorp has been continuously pursuing cost improvement and margin expansion. It has been utilizing AI, machine learning and robotic equipment to reduce manual processing time and errors, improve testing turnaround time and lower per test cost. I think this is crucial to strengthening its financial wellbeing over the long run.

### **Recent Results**

On February 6, 2025, Labcorp released its [FY2024](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755776-labcorp-holdings-inc-lh-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) results. I think the results are very strong:

Labcorp 2024 earnings





* 7.7% revenue growth on Diagnostics and 5.3% on Biopharma, overall 7% YOY growth on the top line, very solid.
* Slight margin dilution mainly due to recent acquisition Invitae but on track to have margin expansion into FY25.
* 5% increase on adj. operating income, and a significant increase down to net earnings.
* Labcorp is continuing paying quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share, totaling annual payout of $2.88, indicating approximately a 1.2% yield of its current stock price, and approximately 30% payout of its net earnings.
* Moreover, Labcorp has been executing share repurchase since FY21, another $250m in FY24 to buy back stocks and further enhance shareholder value.

Management tone on the earning call was very positive and confident when providing guidance for [FY25](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755776-labcorp-holdings-inc-lh-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript). My key takeaways are that the trend of revenue growth will continue, margin expansion will materialize, earnings and free cash flow will be strong.

I also think several recent strategic initiatives are key contributors to such strong results and future outlook, and I believe they will have longer-term accretion impact operationally and financially:

* Fortrea ([FTRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTRE "Fortrea Holdings Inc.")) Spin off. Labcorp spun off its Contract Research Organization (CRO) in June 2023, which is now a standalone company, Fortrea. This CRO business was mainly focusing on clinical trial support, such as patient recruitment, drug development support such as data collection. Firstly, this business is very administrative heavy, no longer aligns with Labcorp’s focus on its core business — lab services to direct patient as well as institutional partners. Secondly, the CRO’s revenue size has been around $3 billion a year, but flattish and even declining. EBITDA margin has been barely single digits, net income can hardly break even. I believe with refocusing back on to its core business, Labcorp can grow faster with its strengths and industry expertise, its decision-making and execution will become smoother.

* Acquisition of Invitae. I believe this new add-on to Labcorp’s business is beautifully complimentary. Invitae’s advanced technology in genetic testing further enriches Labcorp’s spectrum of Biopharma testing varieties, particularly in oncology and rare diseases testing. Labcorp purchased certain assets of Invitae as it declared bankruptcy, not only just paid 0.8x sales, but also clean of prior liabilities. Although it caused slight temporary margin dilution, I believe as its services reach the vast market leveraging Labcorp’s existing service networks, it will eventually become a value driver.
* Minority stake in SYNLAB. This is another initiative to expand into the specialty testing segment, and geographical expansion into European, a rich and deep healthcare market. It, again, perfectly aligns with Labcorp’s objectives to broaden Biopharma business, and expand its global footprint.

### **Valuation**

Looking at Labcorp organic revenue growth, I expect 8% YOY growth on Diagnostics revenue starting from FY2025. I expect 5% growth in Biopharma revenue in 2025 and quickly increases to 15% YOY growth starting FY2028. This means Biopharma revenue mix will increase from currently 30% to 40% of total revenue in the next 10 years. Moreover, I anticipate a 1% YOY growth from M&A activities.

On profitability, I expect cost improvement and margin expansion to start to materialize. I expect 30 basis points YOY cost improvement driven by operational efficiencies, utilizing AI technologies and automation tools. 50 basis points YOY improvement on SG&A, D&A and restructuring expenses.

The WACC is calculated to be 10.1% assuming: risk-free rate 3.8%; beta 1.04; equity risk premium 7%; equity $25.4 billion; debt $6.3 billion; tax rate 25%. The DCF is summarized as follows:

 [![Labcorp DCF](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59134144-1739464556192524.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/59134144-1739464556192524_origin.png) 



Labcorp DCF





Discounting all the future FCF, the fair value is calculated to be $245 per share, as per my estimates.

### **Potential Risks**

* Regulatory and Compliance Risks. Labcorp operates in a highly regulated industry, subject to oversight from FDA, CMS, and state health agencies. Changes on reimbursement policies, non-compliance with regulations could cause revenue write-offs or even lawsuits, investigation and penalties. In the past 5 years, Labcorp has had several federal penalties totaling approximately $21.5m. It isn’t a massive risk when comparing to its revenue size, but it could disturb operation and erode profitability.
* Data privacy. Labcorp is handling millions of very sensitive and confidential private information, data breach could expose patient medical or even financial information, and serious financial consequences for the company, such as lawsuits and fines.
* Competition. Competition could make it harder to gain market share and to maintain pricing power.
* Foreign exchange rate. With the US dollar continues to stay strong, reporting into USD currency on the financials would be a headwind to non-USD business. International business currently counts slightly under 20% of Labcorp’s total revenue, but as Labcorp continues to expand geographically, this FX risk could get bigger.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Labcorp has proven itself to be the leader of life science and diagnostics. Its core diagnostics business is performing strong and steady, while the higher margin Biopharma business is expanding rapidly. Its strategic decisions are well executed, financials are robust, shareholder returns are prioritized through dividend payout and share buybacks. I believe it is a strong company that worths long-term investment in. As per my calculation, with its current stock price reflecting fair market value, I initiate a “Hold” rating on Labcorp and I will watch for future buy in opportunities.
