Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:[DJT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJT "Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.")) is, for many, the very definition of a meme stock. For others, it's the closest thing to a legal prediction market in the name of Donald Trump. After its SPAC merger last March, the stock has been a roller coaster, mostly in reaction to the chaotic news events of 2024.

DJT 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha)





While the company seems to be a net cash burner, the growth of its cash position over 2024 at least dangles the hope that interest income could grow enough to sustain operations. It isn't much, but that would be a start for a positive outlook for this company.

A positive outlook, however, is unclear, and until there are signs of this, the stock is little more than a trading tool for now. I rate it a Hold.

Growing Cash Position
---------------------

DJT is an interesting stock because it seems to have almost no fundamentals. Valued at about $6.7B, the company has barely managed to make a few million in revenues each year, with just over $1M in Q3 of 2024.

Income Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q)





In the third quarter of 2024, revenues were actually down YoY, but interest income grew, while interest expense was nearly wiped out for the period.

Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q)





This owes to the proceeds raised from the SPAC merger and the conversion of the interest-bearing promissory notes into common shares.

Balance Sheet (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q)





The result is that cash and equivalents grew to $672M by the end of Q3. Even if nearly all of this sits in cash or Treasury Bills, short-term interest rates make it easy for this pile to yield about $28M annually. If they really want, some of this could be moved into bonds and dividend stocks with higher yields to increase the cash flow.

A Question of Controlling Expenses
----------------------------------

Even if they do that, it would probably be much easier to make sure expenses are controlled to make breakeven cash flow possible.

Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q)





Operating cash flows indicate much less cash burn than net loss. Still, it grew to $52M for the first three quarters of 2024, with about $12M in capex. The [Form 10-Q](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-045260.pdf) indicates this consisted of $5M spent to acquire data centers and $7M related to the acquisition of WorldConnect Technologies.

It's not clear if this level of capex will continue. Acquisition-related expenses are one thing. How much is needed for data centers and similar infrastructure is another thing. In [their press releases](https://ir.tmtgcorp.com/news-events/press-releases/#b2iLibScrollTo), they announced all data centers being operational in Q4, so they may work with their current capacity for now. They've also announced expansion of streaming services and even financial services.

Even if Trump Media doesn't have this much capex going forward, it seems unlikely that operating cash flows will increase very much. There is one thing worth considering, though.

Mystery of Q4 Results
---------------------

There is an interesting detail in the release about the financial services, which mentions the following:

> To diversify the Company's cash and cash-equivalent reserves of over $700 million as of December 31, 2024, the board has approved the investment of up to $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab.

Somehow, the cash position grew by about $28M in Q4. With no other ATM equity offerings in Q4, this is *a bit* of a mystery. The cash had to come from somewhere, and it raises questions about how high Q4 operating expenses must have been that a net gain in cash and equivalents occurred.

Information on Warrants (Q3 2024 Form 10-Q)





While it's possible that expenses declined and revenues grew as services expanded, I think the most likely answer is that some of the outstanding warrants (11.2M in Q3) were exercised. Only 2.5M would need to have been exercised to raise about $28M, and as the stock rallied in late October and the lead-up to Election Day, exercising for an arbitrage of about $40 per warrant near the peak would have been enticing.

It's worth noting, however, that the release detailing the investment of $250M under Charles Schwab ([SCHW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHW "The Charles Schwab Corporation")) came out in January, and there may not be more detailed disclosures about these investments until Q1 results are out.

Valuation
---------

In my view, with no earnings or cash flow, the company is really only worth its liquidation value at this point. Tangible book value was $3.12 per share in Q3. With the possible exercise of warrants I mentioned, dilution could have easily lowered it. Whatever the difference, it's still substantially lower than current share prices near $30.

Such a valuation only makes sense if revenue growth can materialize with the capital investments made during the year. As Truth Social only seems to be utilized by Trump loyalists, any subscription or advertising opportunities seem minimalist. Growth isn't impossible, but I get the impression that even Trump supporters would prefer to use more mainstream social media and streaming services. Call it an educated guess.

Investors can bet on this upside, but it's about as long of a long shot as you can get with a stock. If that doesn't work out, there's no case that DJT is undervalued.

Conclusion
----------

DJT continues to be one of the more unusual stocks in the market, but the cash it's managed to raise, paired with high interest rates, gives it some hope of slowing the cash burn by the brute force of interest income. If the capital investments allow for more revenue opportunities, that could also help the situation.

While it would not be undervalued at the point, a company that stabilizes itself financially at least has the longevity to stumble upon a growth opportunity. As Q4 results approach, we'll therefore want to see the outlook for operating expenses, capex, and the use of the cash they've raised.

Without clear signs of a more positive outlook, I can't begin to say the stock is undervalued, and this thesis is about as positive as I could imagine one writing for Trump Media. Until that changes, its stock is just a Hold for me.
