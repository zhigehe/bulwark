Income oriented investors like me who are now retired and living at least partially off the passive income from our investments are not too concerned with the threat of tariffs. That is because in a diversified portfolio of income investments that spreads the risk across multiple asset classes, any impacts due to a trade war that results from Trump's tariffs will likely be confined to specific asset classes such as US large-cap equities. Some large cap US stocks are considered overvalued currently, and may be at high risk of price declines if trade wars end up affecting the global economy. If your portfolio is concentrated in stocks of US companies, then you may want to look at adding some international exposure to capture high-yield income from non-US equities to reduce your risk of exposure to potential impacts from tariffs.

One way to hedge against that potential risk to US equity positions is by investing in a fund that holds mostly international equities, with limited exposure to US stocks. I recently discussed that idea when I [reviewed](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754208-sdiv-global-dividend-paying-equity-fund-acts-like-annuity-yields-11-percent "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754208-sdiv-global-dividend-paying-equity-fund-acts-like-annuity-yields-11-percent") Global X SuperDividend ETF ([SDIV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDIV "Global X SuperDividend ETF")), which, I think, is a silly name for a global equity income fund, but a good fund to consider nonetheless. This was what I said about SDIV:

> SDIV offers an 11% distribution yield, pays monthly, and provides diversification away from US equities, with only 31% US exposure.

If that fund does not float your boat, then you may want to consider Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:[IDVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IDVO "Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF")) instead. With IDVO you get not just one, but two income streams as explained on the [fund website](https://amplifyetfs.com/idvo/ "https://amplifyetfs.com/idvo/"):

**Three Reasons to Own IDVO:**

1. **Two Potential Income Streams:** IDVO seeks to provide income from international dividend-paying stocks and by opportunistically writing covered calls on those stocks.
2. **Seeks to Lower Volatility:** Dividend and option income reduce share price volatility versus the overall market during times of broad-based market declines.
3. **Professionally Managed:** Access a professionally managed dividend and option income international investment strategy through the efficiency of an ETF.

Thus, in addition to holding dividend paying international stocks, IDVO writes covered calls against those stocks to generate additional income from option premiums. The fund also offers some possible price stability during volatile market periods and diversification away from US stocks.

> Historically, foreign companies can provide diversification if added to US-only portfolios. In many cases, these companies offer the potential for faster growth than typical domestic companies. Additionally, writing covered calls on these foreign stocks have historically provided higher premiums.

In addition, and of particular interest to income investors, the IDVO ETF offers a distribution yield of about 6% at the current price. The distribution is paid monthly and is variable, but it has remained fairly consistent at an average of about $0.15 per month over the past few months.

### Comparison with Peer ETFs

The sibling fund to IDVO is Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO), which invests in mostly US large cap equities.

In the chart below, IDVO is compared with DIVO and SDIV. Although DIVO is the one-year leader, IDVO is quickly catching up. SDIV was in the lead for the first nine months of 2024 and is now retrenching and preparing to make another move higher.

DIVO has also been around for quite a bit longer than IDVO with an inception date of 2016 versus 2022. And while US stocks have been outperforming other asset classes over the last two years, the next several years may tell a different story.

### IDVO Top Holdings are High-Quality Large-Cap International Companies

The top holdings, Alibaba ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) and Tencent ([OTCPK:TCEHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY "Tencent Holdings Limited")) are both Chinese tech stocks that are already seeing a boost from their [investments in AI provided by the DeepSeek](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405035-china-tech-stocks-enter-bull-market-as-deepseek-fires-ai-opportunities "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405035-china-tech-stocks-enter-bull-market-as-deepseek-fires-ai-opportunities") news. Tencent is up more than 53% in the past year, and Alibaba is 61% higher than a year ago.

The third-largest holding in IDVO is Agnico Eagle Mines ([AEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEM "Agnico Eagle Mines Limited")). AEM is a gold mining company and has delivered more than a 110% return in the last year. With concerns over President Trump's tariffs, gold has been on a recent run higher and is likely to continue to outperform in 2025. In fact, [gold recently closed above $2,900](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405873-gold-closes-above-2900-for-first-time-with-trump-set-to-impose-new-tariffs "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405873-gold-closes-above-2900-for-first-time-with-trump-set-to-impose-new-tariffs") for the first time ever as concerns over tariffs led to a flight to safety.

> Safe-haven demand for gold is surging as anxiety grows over the potential impact to global economic growth prospects from the Trump administration's protectionist drive, as well as its inflationary effect on U.S. domestic prices, ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista [said](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-partial-recovery-from-friday-s-losses/card/gold-jumps-to-fresh-record-highs-on-growing-anxiety-over-trump-s-protectionist-drive--6Ab08dIo1Bm3pU3k48Nr "https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-partial-recovery-from-friday-s-losses/card/gold-jumps-to-fresh-record-highs-on-growing-anxiety-over-trump-s-protectionist-drive--6Ab08dIo1Bm3pU3k48Nr"), and that against the backdrop of Trump's promised new tariffs on steel and aluminum, "gold risk remains tilted to the upside, with further price gains possible in the near term."

AEM gets Buy ratings from both Wall Street and SA analysts.

The next largest holding in IDVO is Barclays PLC ([BCS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCS "Barclays PLC")), a financial firm based in the UK. Similar to AEM, BCS has returned over 110% in price gains in the last year and gets Buy ratings from Wall Street and Strong Buy ratings from SA analysts.

Summary: Buy IDVO for Growing Income and Diversification
--------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that the US economy is in jeopardy of declining due to the threat of tariffs potentially triggering a global trade war that could negatively impact US-based stocks, an investment in high-quality international stocks might be worth considering. Some analysts believe that the [S&P 500 is on the verge of topping out](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757535-s-and-p-500-is-facing-a-major-breakdown-which-could-trigger-a-bear-market "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757535-s-and-p-500-is-facing-a-major-breakdown-which-could-trigger-a-bear-market"), leading to a long-term bear market. Dividend growth stocks can provide a hedge against a bear market decline, and foreign stocks may be less impacted than US domestic stocks.

The IDVO exchange-traded fund offers a relatively low-risk, growing income stream from investing in high-quality, large-cap foreign stocks that offer growing dividends and sustainable cash flows that are likely to be resilient to a substantial bear market decline in US stocks. IDVO boosts the income from those holdings by writing covered calls against them to generate additional income available for distribution to shareholders.

Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
