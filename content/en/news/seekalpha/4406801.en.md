Financial services company Charles Schwab (NYSE:[SCHW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHW "The Charles Schwab Corporation")) on Wednesday announced the launch of broad access to an expanded range of securities in the overnight trading session, following a series of successful pilots at the end of 2024. 

These overnight session orders (EXTO) are expected to be continuous orders that would expire at 8 pm ET each market day.

The company said that now all of Schwab’s retail clients can trade an expanded list of securities, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 stocks and hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5), via the thinkorswim platform suite.

Schwab began piloting expanded overnight access with a small group of clients in November 2024 and has gradually expanded the reach in the intervening months in preparation for broad availability.

“What we saw during the pilot period was that trading behavior more or less mirrored what we typically see during standard market hours,” said James Kostulias, Managing Director and Head of Trading Services at Charles Schwab.

“Activity was the most pronounced at the beginning and end of the overnight session, similar to the behavior we see during market open and close.
