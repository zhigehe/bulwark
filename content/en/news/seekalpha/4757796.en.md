This is an abridged transcript.

Social media company Reddit (NYSE:[RDDT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) reported a massive surge in expenses, led by its R&D spending, which cast a shadow on its better-than-expected fourth quarter results and guidance for the current quarter.

RDDT shares, which IPO'd in March last year, are down 13.6% in premarket action.

Total costs and expenses in Q4 surged 52% to $374.8M, led by a 69% increase in R&D expenses to $188.6M.

Net income for the three months ended December 31 was $71M compared to $19M a year ago. However, the net loss for 2024 increased fivefold to $484.3M from last year, due to IPO-related expenses, the company said.

On a per-share basis, the company earned 36 cents, ahead of the average analyst expectation by 11 cents apiece. Revenue rose 71% to $427.7M and handily beat estimates.

In the company's shareholder letter, CEO Steve Huffman said Reddit experienced some volatility in Q4 with Google Search, which was triggered by a periodic algorithm change, but "traffic from search has recovered so far in Q1, and we’ve regained momentum."

For the first quarter, Reddit expects revenue between $360M and $370M ($365M midpoint) and adjusted EBITDA in the $80M-$90M range ($85M midpoint), ahead of the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $358.7M for revenue and $72.3M for adj. EBITDA.

YouTube TV subscribers may lose access to Paramount-owned channels, including CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and MTV, among others, as YouTube (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) and Paramount (NASDAQ:[PARA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PARA#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) failed to reach a new agreement.

The channels may be removed as early as today.

YouTube stated that they are still actively negotiating with Paramount. "If we can't reach an agreement and their content is unavailable for an extended period of time, we'll offer subscribers an $8 credit," YouTube said in a [blog](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/).

“We have made a series of fair offers to continue our long-standing relationship with Google’s YouTube TV, providing subscribers access to the full array of Paramount’s entertainment, news and sports programming," a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement according to a Deadline [report.](https://deadline.com/2025/02/youtube-tv-paramount-global-carriage-fight-cbs-yellowstone-1236287593/) “YouTube TV is attempting to pressure Paramount to agree to one-sided terms, and these non-market demands may lead to an avoidable loss of Paramount’s networks.”

YouTube and Paramount Global did not immediately reply to Seeking Alpha's request for comment.

Baidu (NASDAQ:[BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) said that its AI chatbot—Ernie Bot—will be available for free to all users starting April 1, a move to help the Chinese search giant regain momentum in the AI race.

Bloomberg reported that the AI service will be accessible on desktop and mobile platforms at no cost.

Baidu (NASDAQ:[BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) is facing increasing competition in China's AI sector, especially from companies like DeepSeek that shook the AI industry in 2025.

Baidu’s Ernie was among the first batch of Gen AI platforms to win Beijing’s approval for public rollout, the report [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/baidu-takes-big-step-to-catch-up-by-making-ernie-ai-model-free). The no-charge move potentially intensifies competition from major domestic players like Alibaba Group ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) to ByteDance ([BDNCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNCE "ByteDance")).

Baidu's stock in Hong Kong climbed as much as 7.9% following the announcement.

The company also plans to [launch](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406635-baidu-plans-to-launch-next-generation-ai-model-in-2025) the next generation of its AI model, Ernie 5, in the second half of this year.
