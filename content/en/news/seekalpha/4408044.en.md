Earnings Call Insights: Arcadis NV ([OTCPK:ARCVF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCVF "Arcadis NV")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Alan Brookes highlighted record net revenue of €3.9 billion for 2024, reflecting 5% organic growth. Operating EBITA rose to 11.5% from 10.4% in 2023, supported by sustainable project choices, Global Excellence Centers (GECs), and automation efforts. The year concluded with an order intake of €4.4 billion, and EPS reached a record €2.70. Key drivers included climate adaptation, energy transition, and infrastructure projects.
* The acquisition of KUA Group for €70 million aims to strengthen Arcadis’ position in the growing data center market in Germany and Europe. This deal is expected to close within two months and includes KUA’s delivery of over 35 complex data center projects since 2018.
* CFO Virginie Duperat announced free cash flow of €228 million, reducing leverage to 1.3x, below the company’s target range. Operating EBITA margin excluding Middle East operations reached 11.7%.

### Outlook

* CEO Brookes noted a strong pipeline for 2025, supported by a record backlog of €3.7 billion, reflecting 16% organic growth. He stated, "With a record backlog of large contracts now preparing to ramp up through 2025, we have clear multi-year visibility."
* The company is on track to train or recruit 2,500 energy experts by 2027, with 500 already trained in 2024. This aligns with Arcadis' focus on grid expansion and decarbonization projects.
* Investments in digital capabilities and expanding GECs are expected to enhance operational efficiency, with the fourth GEC location to be finalized soon.

### Financial Results

* Net revenues for 2024 totaled €3.9 billion, with Q4 revenues reaching €959 million. Growth was driven by energy transition and climate adaptation projects, though short-term client spending patterns were affected by geopolitical uncertainties.
* Free cash flow increased 20% year-on-year. Net debt was reduced to €739 million, aided by disciplined working capital management.
* The strong backlog includes multi-year framework agreements like AMP8 in the UK and large project wins such as the Hudson Gateway project and Fraser River Tunnel.

### Q&A

* Martijn den Drijver, ODDO ABN AMRO, asked about working capital trends and ERP system contributions. CFO Duperat explained that large project ramp-ups temporarily affected working capital, but ongoing ERP implementation would improve efficiency.
