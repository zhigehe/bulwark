* Grace Therapeutics (NASDAQ:[GRCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRCE "Grace Therapeutics, Inc.")) announced that its late-stage trial of GTx-104 met its primary endpoint and provides evidence of clinical benefit when compared to orally administered nimodipine in patients with in aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
* The trial met its primary endpoint, with patients receiving GTx-104 observed to have a 19% reduction in at least one incidence of clinically significant hypotension compared to oral nimodipine (28% versus 35%).
* Adverse events were comparable between the two arms and no new safety issues were identified with patients receiving GTx-104.
* All deaths in both arms of the trial were due to severity of the patientâ€™s underlying disease.
* There were eight deaths on the GTx-104 arm compared to four deaths on the oral nimodipine arm, while the survival status of one patient on the oral nimodipine arm was unknown.
* No deaths were determined to be related to GTx-104 or oral nimodipine.
