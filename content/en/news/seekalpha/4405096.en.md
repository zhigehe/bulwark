Denny's (NASDAQ:[DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) rallied on Friday after Wedbush Securities fired off an upgrade on the restaurant stock to an Outperform rating from the prior rating of Neutral.

Analyst Nick Setyan and his team believe the Keke's Breakfast Cafe business is meaningfully undervalued and underappreciated. The chain is seen as poised to contribute to a resumption in Denny's (NASDAQ:[DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) annual 5% to 7% EBITDA growth algorithm. 

The firm also sees upside for the current 2025 same-store sales expectations and thinks Denny's (NASDAQ:[DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) board will increase the pace of share buybacks. Balance sheet upside was also called out. "We view DENN's ~$100M in owned property and interest rate swaps that ensure an interest rate on its debt in the low-5% range through 2033 are not fully appreciated by investors," noted Setyan.

Looking ahead, Wedbush expects a Q4 earnings beat from Denny's ([DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) next week and upward revisions to full-year guidance.

Shares of Denny's ([DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) were up 7.2% in late afternoon trading.
