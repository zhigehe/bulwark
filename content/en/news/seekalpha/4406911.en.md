Dominion Energy (NYSE:[D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")) -0.6% in Wednesday's trading after reporting [mixed Q4 results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406755-dominion-energy-reports-mixed-q4-results-narrows-fy25-outlook-reaffirms-long-term-guidance "mixed Q4 results") and narrowing FY 2025 guidance while [raising its five-year capital spending plan](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dominion-energy-raises-five-year-capex-plan-meet-data-centers-power-demand-2025-02-12/ "raising its five-year capital spending plan") as it anticipates a potential surge in power demand from a rise in datacenters across the U.S.

Dominion (NYSE:[D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")) said it now expects to spend $50.1B in the 2025-29 period, up from $43.2B estimated previously, after datacenters contracted 88% more power capacity, or 19 GW, in December compared to July.

Q4 operating earnings nearly doubled to $504M, or $0.58/share, helped by a $119M tax benefit that offset lower revenues and higher operational expenditure, compared to $260M, or $0.29/share, in the year-earlier quarter.

The company's electric and gas service areas saw an 8.6% decline in heating degree days, a measure of energy demand for space heating.

Dominion ([D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")) narrowed FY 2025 operating earnings guidance to $3.28-$3.52/share, including estimated RNG 45Z income, and reaffirmed long-term operating EPS growth guidance of 5%-7% through 2029, based on 2025 results.

"We delivered 2024 operating earnings per share in the top half of our guidance range despite worse-than-normal weather in our regulated service areas," Dominion ([D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")) CEO Bob Blue said.
