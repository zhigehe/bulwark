Johnson Controls International (NYSE:[JCI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JCI "Johnson Controls International plc")) late Sunday was upgraded to Buy from a previous investment rating of Neutral by analysts at financial-services firm UBS. They said the maker of heating and cooling equipment is poised to increase profitability with the appointment of a new chief executive.

“We are positive on the appointment of a new, outsider CEO Joakim Weidemanis, who during his tenure as head of Danaher's Diagnostics business oversaw 600 basis points of operating margin improvement during 2020-24 (46% cumulative incremental margin),” Amit Mehrota, analyst at UBS said in a February 10 report. “When overlaying this with JCI's margin opportunity, we have greater confidence in the profit improvement potential.”

UBS raised its price target on Johnson Controls (NYSE:[JCI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JCI "Johnson Controls International plc")) to $103 a share from $90 a share previously, based on estimated multiple of 23 times earnings per share for the second quarter of 2026 to the first quarter of 2027.
