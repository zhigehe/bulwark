Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss slashing tariffs and buying up more energy and defense supplies from the U.S. when he meets President Donald Trump next week, Bloomberg reported Saturday.

Modi is scheduled to land in Washington on February 12, and likely to meet with Trump on February 13, the report said, citing Indian officials familiar with the matter.

Meetings with U.S. business executives, including billionaire Elon Musk, have also been proposed, but nothing has been confirmed yet, the [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-08/modi-s-trump-agenda-to-focus-on-trade-defense-musk-meeting?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=business) added.

New Delhi is prepared to phase out some tariffs imposed in 2019 in retaliation to Trump's trade action during his first term in office, the report said. The South Asian nation will also look for U.S. investment in nuclear projects.

The world's fifth-largest economy might also indicate its willingness to buy more U.S. oil and defense equipment such as fighter jets and drones, the report said.
