Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) reportedly plans to modify its pricing bundle for its Office product suite with the Teams app in order to avoid potential antitrust fines by the European Commission, according to Reuters.

The software giant offered to widen the price between its Office software bundle that includes Teams, and those that do not include the video conferencing and chat app, the [report](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-adjust-office-teams-pricing-bid-avoid-eu-antitrust-fine-sources-say-2025-02-10/ "report") said. The EU wants Office with Teams more expensive to help rivals, such as Salesforce ([CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM "Salesforce, Inc.")) and Alfaview, be more competitive, according to sources familiar with the issue.

The issue has been a multiyear saga for Microsoft.

The EU antitrust watchdog initially opened its ongoing [probe](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4118719-microsoft-allegedly-violated-eu-rules-over-teams-bundling-with-office-apps-european-commission "probe") in July 2023 following a complaint by Slack Technologies, which is now owned by Salesforce. The agency received a second complaint by alfaview, which raised similar concerns regarding the distribution of Teams.

The EC preliminarily review found that Microsoft is dominant worldwide in the market for software as a service, or SaaS, productivity applications for professional use.

The agency is concerned that, since at least April 2019, Microsoft has been tying Teams with its core SaaS productivity applications, thereby restricting competition in the market for communication products and defending its market position in productivity software.

In August 2023, Microsoft said it would [unbundle](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4007838-microsoft-to-unbundle-teams-from-office-to-fend-off-eu-anti-competitive-probe "unbundle") Teams from its Office product and make it easier for rival products to work with its software to address European competition concerns. The tech giant's proposal to sell Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites without Teams at a lower price, among other efforts, has not been enough to satisfy the regulator's concerns.
