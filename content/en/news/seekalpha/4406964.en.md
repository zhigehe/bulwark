Roku (NASDAQ:[ROKU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU "Roku, Inc.")) is set to report fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, and investors will watch out for the TV streaming company’s advertisement revenue amid intensifying competition.

Wall Street [expects](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly "expects") the San Jose, California-based company to post EPS of -0.41, implying an increase of 21.8%, while revenue is expected to rise 16.8% to $1.15 billion during the quarter.

Roku [expects](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4226099-roku-sets-lower-current-quarter-forecast-offsetting-its-decent-q3-results-beat-shares-fall) Q4 gross profit of $465 million and adjusted EBIDTA of $30 million, below the Bloomberg consensus estimates of $476.8 million and $36.2 million, respectively.

ROKU's owned & operated advertising properties like the Roku Channel could feel the heat of increasing competition in ad supported streaming due to new players like Amazon Prime Video, said Jefferies analyst James Heaney.

Heaney believes pressure on media & entertainment spend, one of ROKU's biggest ad drivers, is unlikely to reverse in the near-to medium term, as streaming companies further prioritize profitability.

Seeking Alpha's Quant has rated the company as a [Hold](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/ratings/quant-ratings "Hold"), while the Wall Street analysts have recommended the company as a [Buy](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/ratings/sell-side-ratings "Buy").

“The rise of other forms of digital video consumption that use different devices threatens Roku's business model,” [warned](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757289-roku-unattractive-market-position-but-attractive-asset-for-acquirers "warned") Seeking Alpha analyst Kevin Anthony Arroyo. However, he added that the company's active accounts and advertising platform is an enticing asset for potential acquirers.

Over the last one year, ROKU [has beaten EPS estimates](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/earnings/eps-surprise-summary) 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 50% of the time.

Over the last three months, EPS estimates have seen one [upward revision](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/earnings/revisions) against zero downward move, while revenue estimates have seen seven upward revisions versus one downward revision.

Shares of Roku, which makes streaming devices and owns a complimentary, ad-supported channel, have [fallen](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU/charting " fallen ") over 16% in the last one year, underperforming the broader S&P500 market, which gained nearly 21% during the same period.
