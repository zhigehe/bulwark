Earnings Call Insights: Denny's Corporation (NASDAQ:[DENN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN "Denny's Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Kelli Valade stated that Denny's achieved its strongest quarter of 2024, with same-restaurant sales for Denny's increasing 1.1% and Keke's growing by 3%. She emphasized the company's focus on driving traffic through initiatives like the $2-$4-$6-$8 value platform, expansion of virtual brands, and digital enhancements. Keke's also outperformed the BBI Family Dining Index in Florida for the second consecutive quarter.
* Valade highlighted the relaunch of the Diner 2.0 remodel program, completing 23 remodels in 2024, which demonstrated a 6.5% lift in traffic during tests. For Keke's, the new design prompted a 6% to 8% sales lift in test markets.
* CFO Robert Verostek reported total operating revenue of $114.7M for Q4, with adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increasing 11.1% year-over-year to $22.2M. He attributed this performance to same-restaurant sales growth and positive results from the virtual brand Banda Burrito.

### Outlook

* Management provided conservative 2025 guidance, projecting domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales between -2% and 1%. They attributed the cautious outlook to evolving consumer sentiment and macroeconomic factors.
* Denny’s plans to open 25 to 40 new restaurants in 2025, with about half of the openings expected from Keke’s. Keke's expansion will include 60% company-operated and 40% franchised locations.
* The remodel program is expected to drive a 6.5% sales lift, while a new loyalty CRM program is set to launch in the second half of 2025.
* Commodity inflation is forecasted at 2% to 4%, and labor inflation at 2.5% to 3.5% for company restaurants.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted net income per share for Q4 was $0.14, while total operating revenue reached $114.7M, primarily impacted by refranchising and strategic closures of lower-volume restaurants.
* Adjusted franchise operating margin was $31.9M, representing 51.2% of franchise and license revenue. Adjusted company restaurant operating margin was $5.9M or 11.3% of company restaurant sales.
* Off-premise sales accounted for 21% of Denny’s Q4 revenue, with Banda Burrito contributing a 70 basis point lift in same-restaurant sales.
* Keke’s opened eight new cafes in Q4, marking a growth milestone, as the brand expanded to six states by year-end.

### Q&A

* Nick Setyan, Wedbush Securities, asked about margin expansion confidence. CFO Verostek responded that despite February softness, the company remains optimistic about mid-teens margins for Denny’s, supported by operational improvements and ongoing initiatives.
* Mike Tamas, Oppenheimer, inquired about recent sales trends and macro factors. Verostek noted that January results reflected weather impacts and fewer media weeks compared to the prior year, while February saw a decline in system-wide same-restaurant sales by approximately 5%.
* Jake Bartlett, Truist Securities, questioned the marketing strategy for 2025. CEO Valade emphasized the importance of balancing the $2-$4-$6-$8 platform with a barbell strategy and noted that innovation and digital enhancements would support growth.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed concern over sales trends, noting softer performance in February and macroeconomic headwinds. Their tone was slightly negative during discussions on consumer sentiment and sales deceleration.

* Compared to the prior quarter, management displayed greater caution regarding macroeconomic impacts but maintained confidence in their long-term strategies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Analysts shifted focus to concerns over evolving consumer sentiment and its impact on traffic trends, while management continued to highlight long-term opportunities through initiatives like remodels and digital enhancements.
