### Management View

* CEO Debra Cafaro highlighted a successful 2024, driven by a 16% growth in SHOP same-store cash NOI, a 300-basis-point increase in occupancy, and $2 billion in senior housing investments, which expanded the portfolio significantly. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 7% and entered its long-term targeted leverage range.
* CFO Bob Probst reported normalized FFO per share of $3.19 for 2024, exceeding guidance driven by SHOP performance and accretive senior housing investments. He noted the company's Q4 leverage ratio of 6.0x and liquidity of nearly $4 billion.
* EVP Justin Hutchens discussed plans to transition 45 triple net lease properties into SHOP, projecting a doubling of NOI for the 77%-occupied portfolio by leveraging the Ventas OI platform. He emphasized the favorable supply-demand dynamics in senior housing, supported by a 28% growth in the over-80 population over the next five years.

### Outlook

* The company projects 2025 normalized FFO per share growth of 7% at the midpoint, ranging from $3.35 to $3.46. Total company same-store cash NOI is anticipated to grow approximately 6.75%, primarily led by the SHOP portfolio.
* SHOP same-store NOI for 2025 is expected to increase between 11% and 16%, driven by approximately 8% revenue growth, 270 basis points of average occupancy growth, and 4.5% RevPOR growth, with operating expense growth forecasted at 5%.
* Ventas plans approximately $1 billion in senior housing investments for 2025, with a significant portion expected in the first half of the year.

### Financial Results

* Ventas reported Q4 normalized FFO per share of $0.81, contributing to the full-year figure of $3.19, a 7% year-over-year increase.
* SHOP same-store cash NOI grew 16% for the year, driven by occupancy and rate increases. Total company same-store cash NOI rose nearly 8%, with contributions from outpatient medical and research segments.
* The company closed $1.9 billion in senior housing investments in 2024, with a year 1 NOI yield of approximately 7% to 8% and low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs.

### Q&A

* Omotayo Okusanya, Deutsche Bank, asked about SHOP occupancy trends and strategic adjustments to maximize demographic tailwinds. Justin Hutchens highlighted the effectiveness of Ventas OI in identifying and capitalizing on market opportunities with hyper-local focus and continued investments in community refresh programs.
* Nick Joseph, Citi, inquired about acquisition strategy and return profiles. Hutchens detailed a focus on high-performing assets with 90% occupancy, significant pricing upside, and low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs.
* Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc, questioned the impact of the Brookdale lease transition. CFO Bob Probst clarified that the transition is primarily a 2026 story, with the lease expected to remain under the triple-net structure for most of 2025.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on SHOP growth sustainability and acquisition ROI. Questions reflected confidence in demographic-driven demand but probed potential headwinds in expenses and competition.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing SHOP growth potential and strategic investments. During Q&A, responses were detailed and consistently positioned Ventas as well-prepared to execute on opportunities, with occasional defensive tones when addressing uncertainties around the Brookdale lease.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* SHOP same-store NOI growth guidance increased to 11%-16% for 2025 compared to the 15% growth reported in Q3 2024, signaling continued optimism in SHOP performance.
* 2025 normalized FFO guidance midpoint of $3.41 represents a targeted 7% growth, consistent with 2024 growth rates, showcasing a sustained outlook.
* Acquisition momentum remains robust, with $1 billion in senior housing investments anticipated in 2025 compared to $1.9 billion in 2024.
* Analyst focus shifted slightly from SHOP occupancy improvements in Q3 to strategic execution on acquisitions and the Brookdale lease transition in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified potential headwinds from higher interest rates impacting net interest expenses and debt refinancing costs.
* Analysts raised concerns about labor market pressures on operating expenses and the sustainability of SHOP's impressive occupancy and pricing growth.
* The Brookdale lease renewal decision by Brookdale remains a significant variable, with management acknowledging multiple potential outcomes.

### Final Takeaway

Ventas delivered a strong 2024, surpassing FFO guidance and achieving significant SHOP growth. With favorable demographic trends and limited new supply in senior housing, the company projects robust 2025 growth, led by SHOP NOI increases and strategic acquisitions. Management's focus on leveraging its platform and maintaining financial flexibility positions the company to capitalize on market opportunities, though challenges like labor costs and Brookdale lease outcomes warrant attention.
