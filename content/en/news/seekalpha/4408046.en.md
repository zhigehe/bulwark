Earnings Call Insights: Alithya Group Inc. ([OTCPK:ALYAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALYAF "Alithya Group Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Paul Raymond highlighted record achievements for Alithya in Q3, including the highest adjusted EBITDA margin since going public and the highest gross margin as a percentage of revenue. He emphasized the strong sequential organic growth across all geographies and highlighted the significant early contributions from the XRM Vision acquisition. This acquisition strengthens the company's Microsoft-focused capabilities and opens cross-selling opportunities.
* CFO Nicolas Lavoie reported Q3 consolidated revenues of $115.8 million, noting a sequential increase of 3.8%. He also stated that gross margin improved to a record 32.3%, reflecting efficiency gains and a higher-value business mix. Lavoie added that Alithya's liquidity remains strong, with $63.7 million available in cash and credit.
* COO Bernard Dockrill stressed that Q3 bookings reached $138.4 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x revenue. He pointed out that over one-third of bookings came from financial services and insurance, signaling a recovery in these areas. Dockrill also noted that a significant proportion of bookings involved high-value enterprise transformation engagements.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its three-year strategic plan, targeting gross margins of 33%-35%. Paul Raymond stated, "We think that's achievable within the next three years" and highlighted the company's consistent focus on higher-margin business to reach this target.
* The company expects continued growth in its U.S. operations and aims to expand its technology and vertical capabilities, including exploring opportunities in SAP and AI-driven enterprise transformations.
* The integration of XRM Vision is positioned to support growth through enhanced Microsoft capabilities and smart shoring expansion.

### Financial Results

* Q3 revenues were $115.8 million compared to analysts' estimate of $113.84 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.3 million, with a record margin of 8.9%. Adjusted net earnings came in at $5.7 million.
* Gross margin improved to 32.3%, up from 30.6% in the previous quarter. This was attributed to a higher-value business mix and improved operational efficiencies.
* SG&A expenses were reduced by $700,000 year-over-year, driven by lower professional fees and occupancy costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation.
