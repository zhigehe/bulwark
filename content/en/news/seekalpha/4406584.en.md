Earnings Call Insights: Lyft (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO David Risher highlighted that 2024 was a year of reinvention and industry leadership for Lyft, achieving all-time highs in rides, riders, and driver hours. Market share at the end of January 2025 reached its highest since 2022, driven by strong execution and customer-focused innovations.
* Lyft introduced and expanded several features, including Price Lock, which saw approximately 70% of users subscribing month-to-month and contributed to higher rider loyalty. Additionally, the Women+ Connect feature has supported over 50 million rides since its launch.
* Lyft's DoorDash partnership resulted in nearly 8 million rides, contributing to a record number of scheduled rides, which are longer and higher-margin. Lyft Black and SUV rides grew 41% year-over-year, owing to vehicle eligibility adjustments, increased driver supply, and expansion to new markets.
* CEO Risher announced future plans for autonomous vehicles through partnerships with May Mobility and Marubeni, with a fleet deployment starting in Dallas by 2026. The AV strategy includes leveraging Lyft’s fleet management expertise and rider network.
* CFO Erin Brewer reported that Lyft achieved its first year of GAAP profitability and positive free cash flow, with free cash flow of $766 million in 2024.

### Outlook

* For Q1 2025, Lyft expects rides growth in the mid-teens year-over-year, gross bookings of $4.05 billion to $4.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA between $90 million and $95 million with an EBITDA margin of 2.2% to 2.3% of gross bookings.
* Lyft anticipates a 1-2 percentage point impact on rides and gross bookings growth starting Q2 2025 following the end of its Delta partnership. Management remains confident in offsetting this through other partnerships.
