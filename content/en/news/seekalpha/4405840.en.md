The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [should reject](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/alabama-power-tenaska-lindsay-hill-ferc-psc/739639/) Alabama Power’s plan to buy the 895 MW Lindsay Hill power plant from Tenaska because it raises market power concerns, according to a challenge from Public Citizen and other groups, Utility.com reported Monday.

The Alabama Public Service Commission is reviewing the proposed deal, which the Southern Co. (NYSE:[SO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO)) subsidiary said expects would raise typical residential electricity bills by $3.80/month.

Public Citizen cand others contend the planned acquisition comes as Alabama Power has been consolidating control over generation in the state, saying that if the Lindsay Hill deal is completed, Alabama Power would have bought and built power plants, or entered into PPAs, totaling ~3,400 MW in the last five years, raising the utility's control to nearly 12,950 MW.

"Alabama Power’s systematic acquisition of large generating facilities - and by extension, Southern Company's consolidation of generating capacity in the region - is especially concerning given the size of the [Southern Co. balancing authority area]," which includes ~61 GW, the groups said.

In their previous. application at FERC, Alabama Power and Tenaska said the planned deal "will not result in any adverse effect on competition, rates, or regulation and will not result in any cross-subsidization."
