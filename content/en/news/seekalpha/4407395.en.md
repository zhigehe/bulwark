* Paul announced his retirement after 31 years, effective at the end of Q2 2025. Thi La, currently President and COO, will assume the CEO role starting July 1, 2025. Paul expressed confidence in La's ability to lead Corsair through its next growth phase.
* The company is optimistic about the demand created by the NVIDIA 50 Series GPU launch and the potential impact of GTA 6 on hardware upgrades. Paul stated that high-end gaming components are experiencing robust demand, particularly for higher-wattage power supplies and cooling solutions.
* CFO Michael Potter reported Q4 2024 net revenue of $413.6 million. He stated, "We ended the year in a strong financial position with balanced inventory levels and a cash balance of $109.6 million."

### Outlook

* The company projects 2025 revenue in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, adjusted operating income of $67 million to $87 million, and adjusted EBITDA between $80 million and $100 million.
