Major equity averages turned mixed Wednesday, while yields jumped, as Wall Street assessed a hotter-than-anticipated monthly U.S. consumer inflation report.

The Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) was up less than 0.1% after losing much as 1.2% earlier in the session. Advancers included [Intel](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406832-intel-in-focus-as-baird-posits-fab-spin-off-taiwan-semiconductor-involvement "Intel") ([INTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC "Intel Corporation")) +4.4% and [Grail](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406910-grail-joins-quest-widen-galleri-access " Grail ") +10%. The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) was -0.2%, and the Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) -0.4%, but off session lows. Eight of the 11 sectors on the benchmark ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) fell, but three sectors pushed into the green, led by Consumer Staples. 

Treasury yields [spiked higher](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406835-treasury-yields-rocket-higher-after-inflation-data-rises-more-than-expected "spiked higher") in response to the January Consumer Price Index report. The longer end 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) soared 10 basis points to 4.63%, paring its rise. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) rose 8 basis points to 4.37%.

Inflation came in [hotter than expected](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi "hotter than expected"). Headline CPI was +0.5% vs. +0.3% consensus and +0.4% in December. Core CPI rose to +0.4% vs. +0.3% consensus and +0.2% prior.

Shelter, gasoline and food prices increased. Egg prices, a hot topic among American consumers, surged 15.2% M/M on a seasonally adjusted basis, stemming from an avian flu outbreak.

"Overall, today's inflation data should force market participants to re-think the Fed's ability to cut rates this year, especially considering the rise in prices is likely unrelated to any tariff activity from the White House," Charlie Ripley, senior Investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said.

Pricing in the fed funds futures market indicated traders see the Fed leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% until at least October, [according to the CME FedWatch tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html "according to the CME FedWatch tool").

"We do not expect any immediate change in Fed policy, but if there is a series of 2-3 above forecast inflation reports, it could put pressure on the Fed to raise rates," Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, said.

"We remain bullish on the equity markets for 2025, with a year-end price target for the S&P 500 of 6800, but potential tariffs and/or rising inflation could create headwinds," Tentarelli said. He expects to see a pickup in near-term volatility in stocks and higher bond yields.

Among movers Wednesday, CVS ([CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")) +15%, the strongest S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) gainer, after [Q4 results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406692-cvs-health-stock-jumps-q4-beat "Q4 results") beat Wall Street's targets.
