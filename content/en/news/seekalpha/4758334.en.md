Introduction
------------

Sylogist ([OTCPK:SYZLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYZLF "Sylogist Ltd."))(TSX:[SYZ:CA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYZ:CA "Sylogist Ltd.")) shares are up around 22% year-to-date, but I continue to believe they trade at an attractive risk/reward at ~$USD7/share today. Between a combination of new logo growth and continued cross- and upsell, this is a typical SaaS investment story with a positive fundamental outlook. There are macro and competitive risks to think about, but notwithstanding those, I believe investors are presented with an attractive IRR at today’s price.

Sales: Fundamentally Positive
-----------------------------

(All figures are in Canadian dollars. USD adjustments will be made in the valuation section.)

Q3 sales came in at [~$16.6M](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735426-sylogist-ltd-syzlf-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript), down a few hundred thousand from the ~$16.8M posted last year. By segment, subscription sales were up 10%, but this was offset by declines in maintenance and support, services, and hardware. Hardware in particular declined nearly $800K thereabouts to give magnitude. On a 9-month basis, sales are up nearly $1M to ~$50.3M, or low-single-digit percent. And the breakout by segment looks similar - while subscription sales increased 14%, this was offset by the other segments, more specifically hardware sales declines.

The more appropriate, way to contextualize sales is on a per-solution basis for which they have 4 - SylogistMission, an ERP and CRM sold to NPOs and NGOs, SylogistEd, an ERP-style solution sold to K-12 and technical schools, SylogistGov, an ERP sold to U.S. municipalities and governments, and SylogistSolutions, which are a collection of niche solutions (mostly add-ons). Mission sales were up 15% year-over-year and Ed was up 10%, while Gov and Solutions were down 20% and 26%, respectively. So, it’s a tale of two stories.

First, let’s level set. Sylogist acquired Time Clock Now in February 2024 for just $1.65M. They don’t disclose the revenue contribution, but it’s probably a couple of hundred thousand in quarterly sales if I had to guess, or ~100 bps. I.e., It’s relatively small, so not too impactful to their reported sales change. And they also decided in June 2024 to divest their managed IT services business. Adjusting for the acquisition and divestiture and sales would have organically marginally grown year-over-year.

Let’s unpack this beginning with SylogistMission. First, their subscription contracts are going to contain escalators (up to 5%), so that alone is maybe 100-200-ish bps to their sales growth here. But clearly, sales have grown double-digits in both Q3 and on a nine-month basis, so we’re clearly looking at more than price.

From what I can tell, it’s a mix with management commenting that “[n]ew logo wins and cross-selling success are driving continued strength in our SaaS ARR and our SaaS net revenue retention.” With respect to the cross-sells, I contextualize this as natural, software-style client evolution as Sylogist has expressed that it’s typical to win a new logo, start with a relatively smaller engagement, and then upsell that customer over time as they get more comfortable and identify new, unaddressed needs. They also confirmed this on the Q3 call, citing “success with customer upsells and cross-sells that's largely attributable to happy customers using more of what our SaaS platforms now offer.”

As for the new logo growth, I don’t think Sylogist is seeing materially more NPOs or NGOs originating that need solutions. U.S. NPOs have indeed been growing historically, but more so at a low-single-digit rate minus the jump in 2017. I don’t have data on NGOs specifically, but I’d imagine they’re probably following a somewhat similar trend.

Instead, two things are happening. One, Sylogist themselves are expanding their sales team, with 26 “quota carrying” reps today versus 22 in Q3 last year, and 15 at the beginning of 2023. In other words, they’ve nearly doubled their internal sales team in the past 18 months. I could imagine that Mission is seeing some new leads and resultant logo wins from new reps given that Gov is solely partner channel driven.

Then two, on top of their internal salesperson growth, if you go back to pre-2022, management began to discuss their initiative to build out their partner channel whereby they basically wanted to start developing relationships with partners who could recommend their solutions to customers, particularly those they didn’t previously have the same access to. As for how impactful this initiative is to sales, they comment that half of their consolidated bookings are now coming from partners compared to 7% at the beginning of 2023.

That is a material percentage of bookings now coming from partners. Now, perhaps there is some technicality here where if you remove the partner, Sylogist would have still picked up the sale in the end. But nonetheless, judging by the magnitude of this jump, it’s conceivable to me that they’ve won incremental sales from partners now recommending their product for which Mission was a benefactor of this.

Moving over to SylogistEd, which has also grown double-digits in Q3 and 6% on a nine-month basis, this segment too is also going to carry some pricing benefit, but given the growth magnitude, we can infer that they’ve also experienced some “volume” growth here too.

Essentially, what’s happened is that they’ve started marketing WenGAGE from their historical presence in Oklahoma to now marketing in North Carolina. And as they pointed out in the middle of 2023, they were picking up really good traction with school districts. And then on the Q2 2024 call, they essentially confirm that Ed’s “breakout” bookings growth is attributable to their North Carolina expansion and resultant wins here. This would make sense too. The number of schools aren’t materially changing year-to-year, obviously. They’ve made some product investments but similar to the rest of the portfolio, these are more marginal improvements, not enough to drive material sales growth And then there’s nothing I’ve seen or heard competitively that’s resulting in easy share gains.

Moving to their Gov and Solutions segments, both of which are down materially versus last year and are the drag to sales, part of this is decline is resulting from the sale of their IT services, but as we pointed out above it’s not that much. Excluding the IT segment, Gov was still down 20% and Solutions was down 26%.

With respect to their Gov business specifically, it looks like there are two offsetting trends here. For one, they’ve been shifting customers from on-premise license sales to SaaS subscriptions following their product rollout in 2023. This is partly why, I believe, their maintenance and support and their hardware are both lower year-over-year. (Although, hardware’s comp is a little exaggerated in Q3 because of an abnormal sale last year of ~$545K.) I can’t confirm this to be true, but I suspect that as they shift customers, like other businesses who have undergone a similar transition, there’s a revenue decline in the interim that their Gov business is incurring - i.e., declines in hardware and maintenance and support are greater than the uplift in subscription sales.

The second offsetting element, however, is that their Gov business is expanding their scale, so they should be winning some new customers all else equal. A la Mission, they’ve been expanding their partner network with the goal for Gov to be 100% partner-driven. But contextually, they’ve been growing partners throughout 2023 and into 2024, and consistent with this, they do indeed seem to see growing demand. Whatever growth they’re experiencing though is clearly not enough to offset the headwinds of the transition.

As for SylogistSolution, I’m not entirely sure what’s going on. A lot of these solutions are software add-ons to the core software sold within Mission, Gov, and Ed, so from that angle, I wouldn’t expect much sales volatility. And I think that’s a true assumption too. That is, what, I think, is contributing to the sales decline - beyond the IT divestment - is the decline in professional services sales as they transition more towards partners who instead perform that work - and capture that revenue - which would’ve partly been within the Solutions segment. Indeed, they note on the call that “growth was partially offset by an anticipated decrease in project services revenue related to our strategic shift to a partner-led delivery model.”

So, with all of that context in mind, let’s think about Sylogist going forward. For one, cross-selling is a natural evolution that’d be extremely hard for a competitor to disrupt. Then for two, they’re going to keep growing their sales capacity and reach through internal hires and through their partner channel. I don’t yet know how big this can get for them and it’s going to vary by segment, but they’re not nearly mature.

What kind of rate they grow at is something I’m not sure just yet. But if we just hold aside the scaling growth and think about Sylogist in a more stable state, mid-single-digit over time is not unreasonable. The headwinds today will continue - services revenue decline will continue as they shift more business to partners, but as the year-to-date results show, a natural transitional headwind to SaaS - however, both of these headwinds will decline in size.

Putting this in a model, today’s quarterly sales of ~$16.6M translates into something around $65M in annual sales.. The next 12-24 months may be something like 3-4% growth as some of these headwinds reduce in size, but the ensuing years should start to see growth approaching the 5-6% territory, putting FY28 sales at ~$75-80M.

Margins: Near-Term Investment Pressures
---------------------------------------

With respect to margins, reported gross margins declined about 100 bps to 59.7% in Q3 versus last year, and their adjusted EBITDA margins declined about 70 bps to 25.3% versus last year. Helpfully, they break out margins excluding the IT division divestiture, showing a gross margin decline of 270 bps, and an EBITDA margin decline of ~190 bps. And if we break this out by sales type, we can see that both on a Q3 year-over-year and 9-month basis, their recurring revenue and services gross both declined around 400 bps thereabouts while hardware margins increased.

Let’s address margins then excluding IT. Starting with gross margins, I wrote earlier that pricing was positive per contract escalators, so that would’ve been a gross margin tailwind, although I wouldn’t be surprised if labor inflation offset most of this. From a fixed cost leverage standpoint, recall that organically, sales were up low-single-digit (2%) if we adjust for the Time Clock Now acquisition and divestiture of their IT services, so it’s not that impactful.

The bigger changes are happening cost and mix-wise. From a cost perspective, we can see that cost of sales have grown year-over-year much faster than the sales growth (minus IT). From the MD&A, recurring revenue gross margins were “...impacted by increased levels of third-party costs…” and both recurring revenue and project services gross margins “...were compressed largely due to an atypical multiyear project service “wrap up” related to a single customer implementation that was recognized to revenue along with the recognition of accumulated costs relating to the implementation as well as costs relating to customer designated contractor support.”

I’m not sure if the third-party costs refer to their partners or to contract labor for implementation, but either way, let’s talk about the partner side because it should be a headwind. That is, what should happen if this is a more typical arrangement is that the partner should ultimately be selling the solution at more or less the same price Sylogist was previously selling it for through their direct sales team, although the difference is that now the partner is probably capturing some percentage of that sale as compensation - i.e., Sylogist’s cost.

From a mix perspective, this should have been a benefit when thinking about consolidated margins with recurring revenue higher while services and hardware were lower, but not material when thinking about the gross margin decline by sales type. As for what Time Clock Now’s margins were, I don’t know, but considering its likely revenue contribution, it couldn’t have been too impactful.

Moving down to the operating/EBITDA level, inconsistent with sales up (minus IT), total opex was down marginally. However, broken out, their G&A was down about 17% while their sales and marketing expenses were up ~10%, so there are two stories here. And the same dynamic applies on a 9-month basis too. The G&A savings resulted from “a reduction in compensation cost due to restructuring related savings, lower levels of professional fees, lower recruitment expenses on account of the hiring of an internal recruiter, and other miscellaneous savings.”

As for the S&M trend, this has to do with a mix of headcount growth and marketing spend increases like we talked about earlier, with the MD&A further contextualizing their broader history here, stating how S&M as a percentage of sales has increased from around 2% historically to a heavy 12% today based on intentional headcount investments.

Now, let’s think about margins going forward, which is a very important variable to pin down. From the top, I don’t have any problem assuming price/cost is going to remain an unimpactful variable, but potentially marginally positive. And the same goes for mix, by and large, although, there’ll be some benefit here as sales shift to more subscription/recurring sales and less hardware and services - that’ll drive some natural growth.

From one angle, I’m assuming cross-sells will continue to drive some growth over time, and by my understanding of these being natural, time-based evolutions, this should be coming in at solid incremental margins, with the associated cost being incremental salesperson commissions with everything else relatively fixed. At the same time, I’m also assuming new logo growth as they continue to expand their partner channel and hire more internal salespeople, which’ll add cost upfront as the past 12 months S&M growth has shown.

The timing of margin trends is not something I’m able to pin down. However, when I zoom out and think about Sylogist long-term, while I’m not sure when this investment slows, I am decently confident that when it does, they’re going to begin capturing growing margins or more specifically, margins much greater than they’re generating today.

First, recall that they’ve nearly doubled their internal headcount over the past 18 months. This cohort will naturally mature over time with growing sales, thus generating growing margins all else equal. And then secondly, a similar dynamic applies with their partner community for which, as I’ve referenced earlier and which is understandable given how relatively new this initiative is, they have about half of their partners still trying to “get their feet underneath them.” In other words, they’re not entirely focused on selling just yet. But here too, like the internal salespeople, sales per partner - and thus margins - should grow as they mature over time.

The way I’m sort of thinking about the go-forward model is like this. First, if recurring gets to the high-70% of sales range, this could add a couple of hundred bps to EBITDA too, implying more like 27% margins. Second, if I assume FY28 sales are relatively mature, they could be posting more normalized margins in the mid-30% range, if not in the 40%+ range. And I’d just add to that, a la FC next few years, if the sales investments don’t pan out as lucrative as they thought, they can reduce headcount to a more optimal level.

For modeling purposes, I don’t expect them to be posting mid-30% EBITDA in FY28 because I’m sure they’ll still be making some investments, but with their level of partner bookings and ongoing maturity growth, I do expect them to be posting higher margins than 26%. For now, I’m modeling it in the middle at 30%.

Valuation
---------

From a capex perspective, they spent $1.3M in the quarter, just about flattish with last year’s Q3. And on a 9-month basis, they spent ~$4.6M, compared to ~$3.6M last year. This is relatively high as a percentage of sales, but most of this is capitalized R&D spend, not on physical assets. This spend is probably not normalized. Concurrent with their sales capacity investments, they’ve been making a lot of product investments too, hence why capex is running at ~9-10% versus ~2% historically. I don’t believe they need to keep spending this much money as some of these investments were more one-time - e.g., Gov SaaS solution rollout - and considering that as sales grow, they can scale these investments, something like 7%-ish seems more appropriate.

As for the rest of cash flow, it’s M&A focused. Between 2020 and today, they’ve spent about $58M on M&A in total, which is most of their cash generation. And per the comments on the call about M&A, their appetite is unchanged.

As for the deal quality though, it’s tough to judge with all of the investments happening. Now, a lot of this had less to do with the acquisitions specifically and more so their broader strategy, so I’m not sure it’s as easy as reading the reported results as an indication of M&A quality. But considering that I think sales and margins will grow, I don’t have a problem with M&A, but I would be lying if I said it didn’t give me some pause. As they discussed on the call, they are at least valuation sensitive though and willing to pass based on prices being too high.

Putting the model together, I’m assuming FY28 sales/EBITDA of $77M/$23M (30% margins). Minus D&A of $11.5M (15% of sales), SBC of $3.9M (5% of sales), interest expense of $1.3M, tax rate of 25%, and capex of ~$7M (7% of sales), I get to a FCF estimate of ~$CAD11M, or ~$USD8M.

Sylogist is trading at $USD7/share, implying a market cap of ~$164M with 23.5M diluted shares outstanding. Cash is ~$CAD13.3M as of Q3 - boosted by ~$CAD27M of deferred revenue - and total debt stands at ~$CAD19M today.

Per the above, the investment opportunity may not seem like much - i.e., ~20x my FY28 FCF estimate. However, there are two realities from that point. One is that between price, continued cross-selling over time, and leftover runway, it’s hard to imagine that sales are mature then. I.e., I wouldn’t be surprised if they grow mid-single-digit plus beyond FY28. And concurrent with this growth, I’m still assuming that margins aren’t normalized. If they can post mid-to-high-30% EBITDA margins, you’re looking at around $32M in EBITDA in FY31 for which they could still grow from.

With that in mind plus interim cash generation, if they can grow mid-single-digit, the implied IRR at this price gets in the 9-10-11% territory, which is particularly attractive for a sticky software story. The investment case really hinges on margins turning the corner, but I largely believe this to be the case.

What concerns me are three things. One, part of their market is predicated sort of intangible, governmental decisions - i.e., external funding. I don’t think this is an existential risk, but could alter normalized economics. Two, they rely on Microsoft’s CRM, but I don’t really see this as resulting in a future problem. Then three, there’s M&A risk. If they do something similar with underwhelming returns, realized FCF could cut the IRR in half.

Conclusion
----------

All considered, I like Sylogist at today’s price and own shares. The fundamental characteristics here seem to support a higher valuation over time as I think they can grow at a good clip for the foreseeable future. And inversely, with their strong retention rates, I think the downside is fairly limited from an IRR perspective. But I am wary of the risks.
