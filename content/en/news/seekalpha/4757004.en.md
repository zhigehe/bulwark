Introduction
------------

REITs have been somewhat disappointing investments for many investors over the past 3 years or so due to a tough macro environment plagued by higher for longer interest rates.

Although the FED has lowered rates by 100 basis points at the time of writing, and I think we will see more this year, higher for longer interest rates have negatively impacted apartment REITs like Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:[MAA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAA "Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.")) as a result of supply headwinds.

In my opinion, I think headwinds will likely continue throughout this year, but should abate by the end of the year and into 2026. Although I currently rate them a hold, MAA could still be seen as attractive for aforementioned reasons.

In this article, I discuss the company's latest earnings, headwinds, and despite likely continued underperformance, why now may be a good time for long-term income investors to start accumulating shares in Mid-America Apartment Communities.

Previous Thesis
---------------

It's been a while since [I last covered](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631099-mid-america-apartments-camden-property-undervalued-good-time-to-buy) Mid-America Apartment Communities, assigning the REIT a buy rating along with their peer Camden Property Trust ([CPT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPT "Camden Property Trust")). Back in August of 2023, MAA traded at a P/AFFO ratio of 17.1x, well-below their 5-year average of 21.4x.

This, along with their A-rated balance sheet, impressive dividend streak of 28 years, and superior total returns vs the S&P made them a great addition in a long-term portfolio.

Since then, supply constraints have continued to impact the REIT. And MAA's share price performance over the past 18 months has been somewhat disappointing, up only 9% in comparison to the S&P's near 38%.

Supply Headwinds Continue To Impact Performance
-----------------------------------------------

Mid-America reported their [fourth quarter earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755789-mid-america-apartment-communities-inc-maa-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) last week with a miss on both their top and bottom lines. FFO of $2.23 missed analysts' estimates by a penny while their top line missed by $2.22 million. Not overly disappointing for a challenging economic environment, showing MAA's resilience despite supply headwinds.

But even in their resiliency, MAA's same-store NOI declined 2.1% compared to the prior year. Moreover, FFO declined 3.9% from the prior year's quarter while revenue managed to grow 1.4% year-over-year, likely aided by annual rent escalators. But stripping this out, I can see why investors may have been disappointed with the REIT's performance.

In comparison to last year, Mid-America's Q4 performance was slightly different from Q4'23. During that quarter same-store NOI increased, albeit slightly by 0.1%. One thing to note is the REIT also saw pressures from new supply headwinds during that time as well.

But MAA's resiliency showed as occupancy ticked up slightly from 95.5% to 95.6% in their latest quarter. But looking out over the full-year, headwinds continue to plague the company as core FFO retracted from the previous year by roughly 3.2%.

In the chart below you can see FFO has been somewhat flat this year, only increasing a penny from the first quarter. Revenue only grew 1.1% from $543.62 million over the same period.

For comparison purposes, Camden Property Trust's latest quarter saw them post a slightly higher beat of $0.04 on their bottom line while revenue of $386.3 million retracted slightly from the prior year's $387.6 million.

But supply pressure is expected to decline this year. And while this could continue if the FED is forced to leave rates higher or even raise, especially if the President implements tariffs and causes inflation to reaccelerate. MAA should see a better performance in the back half of the year going into 2026.

Investment Activity
-------------------

Despite a challenging economic environment, Mid-America Apartment Communities continues to grow their portfolio despite supply constraints, particularly in their Austin & Jacksonville markets.

But the REIT continued to focus on their Sun Belt markets, acquiring a new 386-unit multifamily community in one of the fastest growing cities, Dallas.

They also closed on the disposition of two multifamily communities in the cities of Charlotte and Richmond for net proceeds of $85 million. They had an additional 7 communities under development and completed two developments in Denver and Phoenix. They also acquired 3-acres of land in Raleigh, North Carolina that management plans to use for future development.

Why MAA Could Be Attractive Long-Term?
--------------------------------------

Aside from the REIT owning properties in growing, attractive Sun Belt cities like Dallas, Jacksonville, Phoenix, and Charlotte, higher mortgages also are keeping homebuyers at bay due to rising rates.

The fact that Mid-America's top 10 markets are also some of the fastest growing cities is also a long-term benefit for the REIT.

You can see in the chart below it's become increasing expensive to own since 2021 / 2022 due to rising mortgage rates and surging home prices. And while this could change over the next several years, I think it's likely MAA and other apartment REITs stand to benefit over the longer-term.

Balance Sheet Remains Healthy
-----------------------------

Another reason MAA could be seen as attractive and likely to navigate current challenges successfully is their cost of capital advantage. With their A-rated balance sheet and ample liquidity totaling $1 billion comprising of cash and revolver capacity, the REIT is in a solid position should inflation reaccelerate and rates stay higher for longer.

Over the past year, their leverage did increase from 3.6x to 4.0x. But still was solid and well-below the range I like to see for REITs. I typically love to see below 5.0x and no more than 6.0x. Peer CPT's net debt to EBITDA stood at 3.9x, with no debt maturing until April of next year.

Mid-America does have roughly $400 million in debt maturing this November. This had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.0%, but seeing by their ample liquidity, this should be of no concern for investors.

Near 4% Starting Yield Attractive
---------------------------------

As previously mentioned, increasing home prices, surging mortgage rates, and supply headwinds continue to plague apartment REITs since 2022. And you can see in the chart below, MAA's starting yield began to rise from below 2% over that same period.

And while headwinds could go on for longer, I think 2025 & 2026 we will start to see MAA's yield move back to historical levels as they're likely to see relief from supply pressures.

Moreover, despite core FFO & AFFO declining from the previous year, their dividend remained well-covered. AFFO of $7.94 declined from $8.24 the year prior. CPT also saw their AFFO retract from the previous year, albeit slightly, from $5.94 to $5.88.

But even with the decline, MAA's payout ratio was still solid at 79%. The REIT also raised their dividend a solid 3.1% this past December to $1.515 a share, showing their commitment to shareholders despite current challenges.

MAA IR





No Margin Of Safety
-------------------

Using management's 2025 AFFO guidance midpoint of $7.79, Mid-America's current FWD P/AFFO multiple of 20.1x offers no margin of safety, especially considering the stock could underperform should rates remain higher for much longer. This would also likely continue to weigh on items such as construction costs, as well as cause current supply pressures to linger.

Moreover, their current price trades slightly above their blended P/AFFO multiple of 19.82x. While MAA's dividend track record, resilient business, and starting yield could be viewed as attractive, I think investors should wait for a pullback or market correction before adding. However, over the long term, as interest rates come down and supply pressures ease, they could see potential upside over the next 12 to 24 months.

Risks & Conclusion
------------------

One risk for Mid-America I think likely is share price underperformance. Although they have a nice starting yield, supply pressures and uncertainty surrounding inflation and interest rates will likely continue to weigh on their share price, potentially causing underperformance over the near to medium term.

Moreover, I would like to see some growth in the REIT's FFO & NOI over the next few quarters before considering them a buy.

In the meantime, I think MAA will continue to remain resilient as their management team, strong balance sheet, and attractive property locations in Sun Belt markets will allow them to successfully navigate macro environmental headwinds.

However, due to their current valuation and likely limited upside until a clearer macro environmental picture appears, I am downgrading Mid-America Apartment Communities from a buy to a hold.
