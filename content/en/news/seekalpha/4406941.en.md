Equinor (NYSE:[EQNR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQNR "Equinor ASA")) will [proceed with the development](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/equinor-push-ahead-with-rosebank-oil-gas-project-britain-2025-02-12/ "proceed with the development") of its Rosebank oil and gas field, the company's U.K. manager said Wednesday.

"We'll have to apply and make sure we have all the permits to make sure we can legally develop it. But we will push forward with it," Alex Grant told Reuters at the India Energy Week conference in New Delhi.

The future of the Rosebank project and Shell's Jackdaw project have been in doubt after a court overturned their approvals, and U.K. Prime Minister Starmer's government has said it would not issue new licences to explore new fields due to climate change concerns, but recently indicated it would [not revoke existing licences](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404025-u-k-pm-starmer-wants-contentious-north-sea-oil-and-gas-fields-to-go-ahead-ft "not revoke existing licences").

Equinor (NYSE:[EQNR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQNR "Equinor ASA")) also is looking to supply more liquefied natural gas to India through long-term contracts, said Desikan Sundararajan, the company's managing director for India.

India already is the world's fourth-largest LNG importer and aims to raise the share of gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6.2% currently.
