He emphasized the launch of SFO1, a retail-focused terminal, as a key growth driver.
* CFO Ethan Tandowsky reported net revenues for the second half of 2024 at approximately €1.1 billion, reflecting 22% growth driven by increasing share of wallet within the existing customer base. EBITDA margins reached 53% for the second half and just under 50% for the full year.

### Outlook

* CFO Tandowsky reiterated expectations for annual net revenue growth in the low-20% to high-20% range through 2026, with slight acceleration projected for 2025. He also indicated continued, albeit slower, EBITDA margin expansion in 2025 compared to 2024.
