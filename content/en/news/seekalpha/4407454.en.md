* Cisco (NASDAQ:[CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc.")) shares jumped over 6% after delivering stronger-than-expected FQ1 results and raising its FY2025 outlook, fueled by surging AI-driven demand.

Adjusted EPS is expected at $3.68-$3.74, exceeding the previous $3.60-$3.66 range and the $3.66 consensus.

* Despite a 71% Y/Y revenue surge that beat expectations, Reddit (NYSE:[RDDT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT "Reddit, Inc."))shares sank 13% as rising expenses and weaker-than-expected user growth raised concerns.
