Earnings Call Insights: Research Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:[RSSS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSSS "Research Solutions, Inc.")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* Roy Olivier, President and CEO, highlighted that the quarter achieved record organic net new deployments, driven by restructuring the sales team into corporate- and academic-focused units. Net incremental ARR growth reached $1.5 million, aligning with the desired quarterly run rate but requiring a few more quarters for consistency.
* Olivier emphasized the strong performance in B2B and B2C platform deployments. He noted B2C slowed at quarter-end due to holiday impacts but expects a rebound in the latter months of Q3.
* According to Olivier, the company is integrating Scite and Article Galaxy platforms with AI enhancements targeting improved user experience and customer analytics.
* Bill Nurthen, CFO, reported total revenue of $11.9 million, a 15.5% increase year-over-year, and platform subscription revenue growth of 47%, driven by Scite’s contributions and deployment growth. Gross margin improved to 48.9% due to a higher mix of platform revenue.
* Nurthen stated, "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $963,000," supported by cost management and scaling efficiencies.

### Outlook

* Olivier outlined strategic priorities for the second half, including expanding disciplined sales processes, increasing investments in sales and marketing, and optimizing AI-driven capabilities.
* Management expects additional short-term expenses to impact CAC and CAC-to-LTV but projects acceleration in bookings by FY 2026 Q1.
* The company targets further improvements in UX and CX across its platforms, focusing on integrating AI into workflows and enhancing analytics tools for customer ROI reporting.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q2 2025 was not explicitly disclosed but net loss was reported at $2 million, including a $2.4 million provision related to Scite's contingent earn-out liability.
* Revenue totaled $11.9 million, compared to analysts' estimates of $11.83 million.
* ARR reached $19.1 million, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase, with $12.7 million from B2B and $6.4 million from Scite’s B2C subscribers.
* Gross margins for the platform business reached 86.5%, attributed to stable labor costs and scaling benefits, while transaction margins slightly declined to 25.2%.
* Operating expenses rose to $5.7 million due to sales, marketing, and technology development investments.

### Q&A

* Jacob Stephan, Lake Street Capital Markets, inquired about the $1.5 million incremental ARR, to which Nurthen explained that most growth was driven by new logo generation, with moderate upsells, particularly in Scite cross-sells.
* Stephan further questioned B2C seasonality, and Olivier noted strong performance in fiscal Q2 and Q3, with slowdowns during academic breaks.
* Allen Klee, Maxim Group, asked about AI-related cost trends. Josh Nicholson, Chief Strategy Officer, responded that AI costs have halved since joining the company, with ongoing efficiency improvements expected to moderate future costs.
* Peter Rabover, Artko Capital, highlighted Scite’s 75% pro forma revenue growth. Nurthen attributed the growth to higher sales capacity, marketing initiatives, and academic sales team success.

### Risks and Concerns
