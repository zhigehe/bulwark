Thyssenkrupp ([OTCPK:TYEKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TYEKF "thyssenkrupp AG")) +4.3% in Frankfurt trading Thursday, rising as much as 11% to the highest level in nearly nine months, after [raising its full-year free cash flow guidance](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/thyssenkrupp-cuts-sales-outlook-after-lower-prices-weak-demand-weighed-on-revenue-f4ef14cd "raising its full-year free cash flow guidance") following a strong performance at its marine systems business.

Thyssenkrupp ([OTCPK:TYEKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TYEKF "thyssenkrupp AG")) said a major submarine order from the German military in December had led to a €1B advance payment during Q1, in what it says is a "changed security policy environment" for defense companies, helping lift orders in the quarter by 57% Y/Y to €12.48B.

The news [highlights the strength](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/thyssenkrupp-raises-free-cash-flow-outlook-submarine-orders-2025-02-13/ "highlights the strength") of Thyssenkrupp's ([OTCPK:TYEKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TYEKF "thyssenkrupp AG")) TKMS marine business ahead of the planned spinoff of a minority stake this year or next, and analysts at Barclays, highlighting the €16B-plus order backlog at TKMS, said the timing of the spinoff makes sense "and should assuage some concerns that ongoing peace talks around Ukraine may dampen valuation."

Partly due to the advance payment, the company said it now expects FY 2025 free cash flow before M&A, a key metric for the company, of between zero and €300M, after previously forecasting a negative range of €200M-€400M.

In Q1, the orders helped narrow the company's cash outflow before M&A to €21M from €531M in the year-earlier quarter.

Thyssenkrupp ([OTCPK:TYEKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TYEKF "thyssenkrupp AG")) reported [Q1 adjusted operating profit](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407668-thyssenkrupp-ag-gaap-eps-of-0_08-revenue-of-7_83b "Q1 adjusted operating profit") more than doubled to €191M, mainly boosted by the company's steel division, but sales fell 4% to €7.83B, dragged by weak demand and lower prices affecting its automotive technology, materials services and European steel businesses.

The company maintained its FY 2025 outlook for net profit and confirmed its forecast for adjusted EBIT of €600M-€1B.
