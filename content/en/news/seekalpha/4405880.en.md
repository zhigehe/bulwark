Earnings Call Insights: Beyond Air, Inc. (NASDAQ:[XAIR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAIR "Beyond Air, Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Steve Lisi highlighted "sequential quarterly revenue growth" driven by hospital adoption of the LungFit PH system, with six new hospital starts and two renewals during the quarter, including a three-year contract renewal.
* The company emphasized the positive customer feedback regarding the LungFit PH device and strengthened customer engagement processes, supported by a robust commercial team and partnerships with Healthcare Links and TrillaMed for U.S. market expansion, including the military and veterans administration hospitals.
* Beyond Air announced LungFit PH's CE Mark approval, enabling its marketing in the European Union and other recognized territories. Two new contracts were signed in the Middle East, and shipments are expected to begin in the first half of 2025, with revenues from international operations anticipated in the back half of fiscal 2026.
* The PMA supplement for a next-generation transport-capable LungFit PH system is expected to be submitted to the FDA shortly, following strong interest after its demonstration at the AARC Annual Meeting in November.
* CFO Doug Larson reported Q3 fiscal 2025 revenue of $1.1 million, compared to $0.4 million in the prior year, with a net loss of $13 million or a loss of $0.15 per share. He noted a significant reduction in net cash burn, down 30% from the prior quarter, attributed to cost reductions like office closures, staff reductions, and adjusted production forecasts.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated its expectation of sequential quarterly revenue growth throughout fiscal 2025, supported by increased hospital adoption and international market entry.
* Further details on fiscal 2026 revenue guidance will be provided during the fiscal 2025 year-end conference call in June 2025.
* The company expects to submit the PMA supplement for the next-generation LungFit PH system shortly, with shipments anticipated to begin globally in early 2025.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for Q3 fiscal 2025 reached $1.1 million, compared to $0.4 million a year ago. Costs of revenue exceeded revenue due to $0.3 million in one-time device upgrade costs and $0.5 million in noncash expenses, including depreciation of undelivered devices.
* Research and development expenses declined to $3 million from $6.8 million in the prior year, driven by reduced salaries and stock-based compensation.
* SG&A expenses decreased to $7.7 million from $9.8 million, primarily due to reduced salaries and stock-based compensation.
* Net cash burn for the quarter was $7.6 million, with the company holding $10.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024. Management anticipates cash sufficiency through spring 2026, provided internal revenue targets are met and costs remain controlled.

### Q&A

* Jason Wittes, Roth Partners: Asked about the revenue impact timing from CE Mark approval. CEO Steve Lisi explained revenue contributions will begin modestly in June and grow significantly by September and December.
* Wittes followed up on operating expenses. Lisi confirmed incremental reductions would continue, particularly after completing the PMA submission for the next-generation LungFit PH.
* Sam Eiber, BTIG: Inquired about changes in the commercial organization. Lisi attributed improvements to a cultural shift led by the new Chief Commercial Officer, David, and enhanced customer service, which has driven sequential strength.
* Eiber: Asked about the material impact of the transport-capable device. Lisi noted strong interest but declined to comment on having a formal waiting list.
* Jason Bednar, Piper Sandler: Questioned fiscal 2026 guidance. Lisi deferred, stating guidance will be provided in June. He noted the difficulty in predicting U.S. vs. international revenue contributions due to variable regulatory timelines and contract timing.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the sequential revenue growth and progress in international markets. Their tone was mostly positive but included skepticism regarding regulatory timelines and expense controls.
* Management displayed confidence in their strategic initiatives, with CEO Steve Lisi emphasizing "momentum" and "positive feedback" from customers. However, he acknowledged uncertainties, particularly with FDA processes, using phrases like "we don't know" and "things are still in flux."
* Compared to the previous quarter, management appeared more confident, buoyed by tangible progress in hospital contracts and international approvals.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue increased from $0.8 million in Q2 to $1.1 million in Q3, reflecting significant growth in hospital contracts and device deployment.
* Operating expenses showed continued reductions in both R&D and SG&A categories, aligning with prior quarter cost-control measures.

* Management sentiment improved, supported by clear markers of progress, including CE Mark approval and increased customer adoption.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management cited uncertainties regarding FDA timelines for the PMA supplement and the LungFit PH label expansion for cardiac surgery.
* Analysts raised questions about potential delays in international market penetration due to variable regulatory processes in different regions.
* Cost pressures from upgrading devices and achieving scale in international markets were highlighted, though management noted these are expected to decrease over time.
