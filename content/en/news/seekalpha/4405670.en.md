Wall Street's major averages find themselves in the green on Monday, as investors look ahead toward key economic data set to be released later in the week.

Leading the way higher has been the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) as it was +1.1%. Also, the benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500)) was +0.7% and the blue-chip Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) was +0.3%. 

From an S&P sector perspective, seven of the 11 S&P segments are pushing up into positive territory. The two best performers on the session have been Energy, as oil ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM)) advances 1.7%, and Info Tech. At the other end of the spectrum, the worst performing sector on Wall Street has been Financials.

The Treasury market has noticed a downward shift. The shorter end U.S. 2-Year Treasury yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y)) dipped 2 basis points to 4.26%. At the same time, the longer-end U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y)) moved lower by 2 basis points to 4.47%.

On the economic front, all is quiet on Monday as investors look ahead to key inflation data that is scheduled to land later in the week.

"The week after payrolls is usually quiet, but due to the first Friday of the month being the latest it could possibly be this month, then we bump straight into U.S. CPI in the week, with PPI on Thursday for an added bit of inflationary sparkle," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.

Moreover, while there are no major economic events scheduled for today, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee will take place on Tuesday.

As for stocks that are on the move, ON Semiconductor ([ON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON "ON Semiconductor Corporation")) has dropped 7% after reporting a miss on its latest earnings report. At the same time, shares of McDonaldâ€™s ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) are higher by 5% after its earnings report was announced.
