Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) is partnering with Anduril, a defense company startup that specializes in drones, to develop and manage the next phase of the U.S. Army's high-tech battle goggles.

Officially dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) program, the headwear will provide soldiers with a comprehensive, body-worn system that integrates advanced augmented reality and virtual reality. Enhancements include beyond line-of-sight perception capabilities, increasing combat effectiveness, survivability against drones, and accelerating mission command of unmanned systems.

"The IVAS program represents the future of mission command, combining technology and human capability to give soldiers the edge they need on the battlefield," said Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries. "The ultimate goal is to create a military ecosystem where technology acts as an extension of human capability."

The U.S. Army initially awarded the [contract](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397671-us-army-considers-new-approach-for-its-augmented-reality-combat-goggles-report "contract") to Microsoft back in 2021. Microsoft signed a deal which it said at the time could be worth $21.88B, to provide HoloLens technology for 120,000 headsets.

Through this new agreement, Anduril will now establish Azure as its preferred hyperscale cloud to support its artificial intelligence development.

Anduril also established recent partnerships with other tech leaders for AI-powered defense industry solutions, including [OpenAI](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4363340-openai-partners-with-defence-company-anduril-to-build-ai-for-military-use " OpenAI ") and [Palantir Technologies](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4389615-palantir-anduril-may-form-consortium-to-take-on-big-defense-companies-report "Palantir Technologies") ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")).

Earlier this month, Anduril announced it is in discussions for a new [funding round](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405320-defense-startup-anduril-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding-valuing-company-at-28b-cnbc "funding round") that could double its valuation to $28B. And last month, the Costa Mesa, Calif.-based tech company revealed plans to build a $1B [factory](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4395801-ai-military-startup-anduril-set-to-build-1b-factory-in-ohio "factory") in Columbus, Ohio. The "hyperscale" plant will bring more than 4,000 jobs to Ohio and eventually produce tens of thousands of autonomous systems and weapons every year.
