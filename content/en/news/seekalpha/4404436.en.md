Super Bowl LIX will capture the attention of a global audience on Sunday. For investors, the market performs better on average after an NFC win, returning on average 13.3% over the next year versus 11.1% after an AFC win, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. As for individual stocks, Super Bowl advertising has moved the revenue meter in the past for multinationals such as PepsiCo ([PEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP "PepsiCo, Inc.")), Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")), Anheuser-Busch InBev ([BUD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BUD "Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV")), and smaller companies blowing out their budget on the high-profile event.

Once again, food and beverage companies will dominate the commercial lineup during the game. First-time advertisers such as Haagen-Dazs ([OTCPK:NSRGY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY "Nestlé S.A.")), Ritz Crackers ([MDLZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ "Mondelez International, Inc.")), and Totino's Pizza Rolls ([GIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GIS "General Mills, Inc.")) will be featured, while traditional advertisers PepsiCo ([PEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP "PepsiCo, Inc.")) and Yum! Brands' ([YUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM "Yum! Brands, Inc.")) Taco Bell are back. Nestle's NSRGY) Coffee Mate has a commercial with Shania Twain set to run, while Unilever's ([UL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL "Unilever PLC")) Hellmann's Mayonnaise brought in Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan to reunite in a commercial based on the 1989 movie *When Harry Met Sally*. Food delivery players Uber Eats ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")), DoorDash ([DASH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASH "DoorDash, Inc.")), and Instacart (NASDAQ:[CART](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CART "Maplebear Inc.")) also have commercials planned.

Meanwhile, Starbucks ([SBUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX "Starbucks Corporation")) is running an advertisement during the pregame show to highlight its new coffeehouse vibe. The company is also offering free coffee to its loyalty members on the Monday following the Super Bowl in an event called "Starbucks Monday."

Naturally, pizza will be front and center on Sunday as the Super Bowl coincides with National Pizza Day for the first time in history. That has pizza operators Domino's Pizza (NASDAQ:[DPZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DPZ "Domino's Pizza, Inc.")), Pizza Hut ([YUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM "Yum! Brands, Inc.")), Papa John's International (NASDAQ:[DPZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DPZ "Domino's Pizza, Inc.")), and Little Caesars set up for huge days.

Applebee's ([DIN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIN "Dine Brands Global, Inc.")), Buffalo Wild Wings (Inspire Brands), California Pizza Kitchen (owned by a consortium of investors), Wingstop (NASDAQ:[WING](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WING "Wingstop Inc.")), and Popeyes ([QSR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR "Restaurant Brands International Inc.")) are some of the restaurants chains running significant Super Bowl promotions.

In the beer world, Anheuser-Busch InBev ([BUD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BUD "Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV")) plans to air five commercials during the game, totaling three minutes of national advertising time and 45 seconds of regional advertising time. The investment makes Anheuser-Busch ([BUD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BUD "Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV")) the largest Super Bowl advertiser across all beer, alcohol, and consumer packaged goods companies for the event. The advertising lineup includes spots for the red-hot Michelob Ultra brand, Busch Light, Budweiser, Bud Light, and Stella Artois. Each brand's commercial will serve as a launching point for their respective campaigns throughout the year. Molson Coors Beverage Company’s ([TAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TAP "Molson Coors Beverage Company")) Coors Light is making its third Super Bowl showing after BUD gave up its long period of exclusivity on Super Bowl beer advertising.

Beverage upstarts Liquid Death (canned water), Cirkul (bottled water), and Poppi (prebiotic soda) are all looking to create a splash with their advertising spots. All three have already seen a surge of consumer interest this year. Notably, Live Nation ([LYV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYV "Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.")) owns a stake in Liquid Death, which is making its first Super Bowl appearance. Meanwhile, Poppi will be looking to replicate last year's performance, when sales on Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) spiked in the weeks after its Super Bowl appearance.
