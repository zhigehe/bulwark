Chief executives of firms in the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors pulled down their expectations for what inflation will be over the next 12 months in Q1 2025, according to the latest Cleveland Fed's Survey of Firms' Inflation Expectation released on Monday.

Business leaders expect the Consumer Price Index to be +3.2% over the next 12 months, down from +3.8% in the prior quarter's reading and well below the 7.3% peak logged in Q4 2022. Note that each figure represents the mean.

The sequential [decrease](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/survey-of-firms-inflation-expectations "decrease") comes in stark contrast to [an increase](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397337-business-inflation-expectations-rise-to-2_2-in-january-atlanta-fed "an increase") in business inflation expectations from the Atlanta Fed's monthly survey, amid political and economic uncertainty under the Trump administration.

On the consumer side, year-ahead implied inflation also [surged](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405160-year-ahead-inflation-expectations-climb-further-as-consumer-sentiment-slides-umich "surged"), according to a University of Michigan survey.
