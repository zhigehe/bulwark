### Management View

* CEO Aaron Saak highlighted a 12% sales growth for Q4 2024 and 7% for the full year, supported by strong performance in international currency and 109% adjusted free cash flow conversion for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.26 for the year.
* Saak pointed to strategic initiatives in the Currency business, including winning 13 new denominations featuring micro-optics and completing significant equipment upgrades for the launch of new U.S. banknotes in 2026.
* The company secured its first micro-optics contract through the OpSec channel with a luxury perfume brand, combining physical label technology with digital authentication and online brand protection services.
* CFO Christina Cristiano reported $399 million in Q4 sales, a 12% increase year-over-year, driven by international currency. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 stood at 27%, slightly below the prior year due to mix. Adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full year was 76%.
* Cristiano highlighted a backlog of $248 million in the Security and Authentication Technologies segment, indicating high confidence for mid-single-digit growth in 2025.

### Outlook

* The company expects 2025 adjusted EPS to range between $4 and $4.30, with overall sales growth projected at 1%-3%, including FX headwinds.
* CPI is forecasted to grow in low single digits, with gaming sales recovering in the second half of 2025 after a slow first half due to inventory adjustments.
* Security and Authentication Technologies are expected to deliver mid-single-digit growth, fueled by international currency backlog and the full-year impact of OpSec.
* U.S. government currency sales are projected to decline by approximately 20% in 2025 due to Federal Reserve actions and equipment upgrades.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $1.20, and sales reached $399 million, reflecting a 12% year-over-year increase.
* Core sales in the CPI segment were flat, with growth in most end markets offset by continued softness in gaming. Segment operating margin held at 29%, with a backlog of $146 million.
* Security and Authentication Technologies saw a 7% core sales increase in Q4, driven by international currency. Full-year core sales growth was 5%, supported by strong volume and backlog.
* The company ended 2024 with net leverage of 1.5x and expects to reach 2.3x after closing the De La Rue Authentication Solutions acquisition in Q2 2025.

### Q&A
