U.S. stocks closed in the red Friday, turning lower after a surge in consumers' inflation expectations, then falling further on a report that President Donald Trump was planning reciprocal tariffs.

Those items overshadowed a mixed January U.S. jobs report that will likely keep the Federal Reserve standing pat on interest rates for now. 

The benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) closed -0.95% at 6,025.99, and the Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) -1.4%. The Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) -1%. All 11 of the S&P 500's ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) sectors fell, led by Consumer Discretionary -2.5%. [Amazon](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404698-amazon-solid-q4-results-upstaged-by-soft-guidance-fx-risks "Amazon") ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), part of all the averages, fell -4% on [soft Q1 guidance.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404698-amazon-solid-q4-results-upstaged-by-soft-guidance-fx-risks "soft Q1 guidance")

"Today we saw a spiky combination the [VIX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIX "S&P VIX Index") hitting support – meaning demand for S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) puts was due to rise – plus an inflation-fear flare being sent up in Michigan plus the occasional tariff bomb," Alex King, investing group leader of [Cestrian Capital Research](https://seekingalpha.com/author/cestrian-capital-research "Cestrian Capital Research"), told Seeking Alpha.

In the fixed-income market, the 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) rose 5 basis points to 4.50%. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) rose 7 basis points to 4.30%.

The major averages were knocked down further after Reuters reported that Trump told Republican lawmakers he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs as early as Friday. Bloomberg later reported that Trump will hold a press conference about reciprocal tariffs on Monday or Tuesday.

China this week launched retaliatory tariffs after the [U.S. hit Chinese imports with a 10% tariff](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403017-yales-budget-lab-sees-223-hit-to-average-american-household-from-trumps-china-tariffs "U.S. hit Chinese imports with a 10% tariff"). Levy plans for Mexican and Canadian products were put on hold for at least 30 days for further negotiations.

Stocks turned negative shortly after the opening bell, with the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index showing [inflation expectations rising to 4.3%](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405160-year-ahead-inflation-expectations-climb-further-as-consumer-sentiment-slides-umich "inflation expectations rising to 4.3%") over the next year. The consensus estimate was 3.3%.

"The decrease was pervasive, with Republicans, Independents, and Democrats all posting sentiment declines from January, along with consumers across age and wealth groups," Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said. Sentiment itself slid to 67.8 in February's preliminary reading from 71.1 last month.

In the [nonfarm payrolls report](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405109-nonfarm-payrolls-climbs-less-than-expected-in-january-unemployment-unexpectedly-dips "Nonfarm payrolls"), jobs rose by 143K in January, less than the 168K consensus estimate, and a drop from December additions of 307K. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate slipped to 4.0% from 4.1%, and wage growth of 0.5% M/M was hotter than the +0.3% consensus.

The "employment report probably keeps the Fed on hold for probably one more meeting. While jobs weren’t exceptional by any means, a lower unemployment rate and a strong increase in wage growth means the labor market is still healthy," Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, said.

January is typically a "noisy month" for the jobs report after a surge in holiday hiring in December, Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said. 

"We think the bigger issue is around tariffs and worry that a trade war could develop – either as an intentional strategy or even as a result of miscalculation between the US and other trading partners – and this is what can interrupt the bull market and economic expansion," Zaccarelli said. 

The key equity averages were pushed into the loss column for the week, with the S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) down 0.2%. The Nasdaq ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) and the Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) each fell 0.5%.

"If you have your wits about you these are wonderful times to make long and short trading gains," King at [Cestrian Capital Research](https://seekingalpha.com/author/cestrian-capital-research "Cestrian Capital Research") said. "We expect a series of new highs in equities in the coming months, none of which will be made easy”.
