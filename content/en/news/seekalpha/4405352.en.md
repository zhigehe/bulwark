Boeing said Friday that it expects to lay off around 400 employees at its Space Launch System moon rocket program.

In a statement to Seeking Alpha, the aerospace giant said it has informed the program’s employees of the possible job cuts.

The layoffs are expected to occur by April, the statement said.

Boeing said the cuts are needed “to align with revisions to the Artemis program and cost expectations.”

The company said it was looking to “minimize job losses” reassigning employees to other projects.
