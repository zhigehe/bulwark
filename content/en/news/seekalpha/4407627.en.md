Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:[STX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX "Seagate Technology Holdings plc")) has agreed to acquire Intevac (NASDAQ:[IVAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVAC "Intevac, Inc.")), a supplier of thin-film processing systems, in an all-cash transaction for $4.00 per share.

The definitive deal provides for Seagate to launch an all-cash tender offer for all of Intevac’s outstanding shares.

The transaction is expected to close in late March or early April 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Seagate (NASDAQ:[STX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX "Seagate Technology Holdings plc")) expects the deal to be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share over the long-term and have minimal impact to non-GAAP EPS over the short-term.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, Intevac (NASDAQ:[IVAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVAC "Intevac, Inc.")) will pay a one-time special dividend of $0.052 per share. Separately, Intevac has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 a share, payable on March 13, 2025, to stockholders of record as of Feb. 28, 2025.

The transaction and the special dividend deliver aggregate consideration to Intevac stockholders of $4.052 per share, or $4.102 per share including Intevac’s regular quarterly dividend. This represents a premium of ~21% to Intevac’s closing price of $3.38 per share on Feb. 12.

As a result of the deal, Intevac will no longer hold its earnings call, which was previously scheduled for Feb. 25.
