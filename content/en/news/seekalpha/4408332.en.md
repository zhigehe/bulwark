### Management View

* CEO Don Wood highlighted a record-breaking quarter and year for Federal Realty, with leasing activity reaching unprecedented levels. The company completed 100 comparable deals for 649,000 square feet in Q4 at 10% higher cash rent and 21% higher straight-line rent than prior leases. Full-year leasing volume surpassed 2.4 million square feet, setting all-time records.
* Occupancy reached 96.2% on a leased basis and 94.1% on an occupied basis, the highest in nearly a decade. Additionally, dividends per share were raised to $4.40 for the 57th consecutive year.
* The company achieved total revenues exceeding $300 million for the quarter and $1.2 billion for the year, both growing by 7% and 6% over respective prior periods. FFO per share was $1.73 for Q4 and $6.77 for the year, both record highs.
* CFO Dan Guglielmone noted, "Primary drivers for the solid performance in '24 [include] POI growth in our comparable portfolio with the primary catalyst being occupancy increases," as well as contributions from redevelopment and expansion projects.
* The company announced a $123.5 million acquisition of a Northern California shopping center and unveiled two development projects: a $45 million residential-over-retail project in Hoboken, NJ, and a $32 million redevelopment in Philadelphia.

### Outlook

* Federal Realty introduced 2025 FFO per share guidance of $7.10 to $7.22, marking a midpoint growth of 5.8%. Occupancy is expected to increase from 94.1% to approximately 95% by year-end 2025.
* The company anticipates comparable property operating income growth of 3% to 4% for 2025, with an additional 40 basis points excluding COVID-era prior-period rents and term fees.
* Guidance incorporates incremental POI contributions of $3 million to $5 million from redevelopment and expansion pipelines. Capitalized interest is forecast to decline to $12 million to $14 million, down from $20 million in 2024.

### Financial Results

* Federal Realty reported FFO per share of $1.73 for Q4 2024, which included a $0.04 one-time charge related to a management departure. Excluding this charge, FFO for the quarter reached $1.77.
* Comparable property operating income grew 4.2% in Q4 and averaged 3.4% for the year. Same-store residential POI grew 5%, bolstered by the Darien Commons project, which achieved 7% growth, including contributions from newly stabilized properties.
* Total revenues for Q4 surpassed $300 million, with acquisitions and redevelopments performing above underwriting expectations.

### Q&A

* Juan Sanabria, BMO Capital Markets: Asked about tax credits at Freedom Plaza. CEO Don Wood explained, "The tax credits reflect the net number...earned revenues associated with the project in a series of extremely complex transactions."
* Steve Sakwa, Evercore: Inquired about leasing dynamics. CEO Wood responded, "It's very common to have more than one real opportunity or tenant for desirable spaces," emphasizing strong demand and improved control over lease terms.
* Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler: Queried about credit quality amid retail bankruptcies. CEO Wood stated, "Struggling retailers like Big Lots and Party City have minimal exposure in our portfolio," adding that a normalized credit reserve of 75-100 basis points is prudent given market volatility.
* Michael Goldsmith, UBS: Asked about the drivers of expected POI acceleration in 2025. CFO Guglielmone highlighted occupancy increases as the primary growth catalyst, with strength in leasing and rent commencements.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed optimism about leasing momentum and the company's ability to navigate consumer spending trends but raised concerns about potential headwinds, including seasonality and tenant bankruptcies. Questions focused on balance sheet flexibility, credit reserve assumptions, and acquisition strategy.
* Management maintained a positive tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing growth opportunities and portfolio strength. In Q&A, they adopted a more cautious stance when addressing potential risks, such as macroeconomic uncertainties and retailer distress.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Management introduced forward-looking FFO guidance in Q4, whereas Q3 focused on achieving 2024 targets. Strategic focus shifted toward acquisitions and new developments in Q4, expanding beyond internal growth.

For 2025, the company projects 5.8% FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance, driven by increasing occupancy, redevelopment contributions, and an active acquisition pipeline.
