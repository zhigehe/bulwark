Earnings Call Insights: Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. ([OTCPK:NSANY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSANY "Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.")) Q3 2024

### Management View

* CEO Makoto Uchida announced the termination of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Honda and Mitsubishi Motors for a business integration. The decision followed Honda’s revised proposal to acquire Nissan as a wholly-owned subsidiary, which raised concerns about Nissan’s autonomy and long-term potential.
* CFO Jérémie Papin reported net revenue of ¥9 trillion, operating profit of ¥64 billion, and net income of ¥5 billion for the first nine months of FY2024. Retail sales saw a slight increase outside of China, with North America experiencing a 10% rise in Q3 alone. However, sales in China continued to decline due to market challenges.
* CFO Papin outlined that Nissan’s auto free cash flow remains negative at ¥506 billion, citing increased expenses from marketing and new product launches alongside cost pressures from inflation and Monozukuri costs.

### Outlook

* Nissan maintained its FY2024 outlook for retail sales at 3.4 million units and production at 3.2 million units. However, the company revised its revenue guidance downward to ¥12.5 trillion and operating profit to ¥120 billion, reducing the operating margin expectation to 1%. These adjustments reflect higher variable marketing expenses and lower wholesales.
* FOREX assumptions for Q4 stand at ¥100 to the US dollar and ¥161 to the euro, with restructuring costs of approximately ¥100 billion expected to impact net income.
* CEO Uchida emphasized the continuation of strategic partnerships while exploring new alliances to strengthen competitiveness and efficiency.

### Financial Results

* Q3 standalone retail sales rose nearly 2% globally, driven by a 10% increase in North America, supported by strong performance from new models such as the Kicks and INFINITI QX80.
* Net revenue for the automotive business was ¥8 trillion, with a negative operating margin of 1.8%. Year-to-date, raw material costs and foreign exchange contributed positively, but sales performance and inflationary pressures resulted in a combined ¥320 billion negative impact.
* Nissan achieved notable fixed cost savings in manufacturing, marketing, and general administrative expenses, though these were offset by higher sales expenses and Monozukuri costs.

### Q&A

* Kota Yuzawa, Goldman Sachs, asked about the reasons for terminating the Honda integration discussions and the broader implications for turnaround costs. CEO Uchida reiterated concerns about autonomy under Honda’s proposed structure and clarified that the ¥100 billion restructuring cost is an initial estimate, with further updates to follow.
* Kohei Takahashi, UBS Securities, questioned Nissan’s ability to achieve fixed expense reductions and sought clarification on the timeline for implementing SG&A savings. HR Chief Toru Ihara highlighted global workforce reductions, including voluntary separation programs and outsourcing to lower-cost regions, as key cost-saving measures.
* Yoshitaka Ishiyama, Mizuho Securities, inquired about the strategic review timeline and areas of potential partnerships. CEO Uchida mentioned ongoing evaluations of new partnerships in mobility and technology domains while emphasizing the need for Nissan to improve standalone performance.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism regarding Nissan’s ability to execute its turnaround initiatives, particularly in light of downward revisions to guidance and ongoing challenges in major markets like China and North America. Questions focused on cost management and strategic realignment, reflecting a cautious tone.
* Management maintained a slightly defensive stance during the Q&A, with recurring phrases such as “we need to explore” and “we are discussing,” indicating ongoing uncertainty about future actions. CEO Uchida’s tone shifted to emphasize urgency and accountability for delivering tangible results.
* Compared to Q2, management’s tone appeared more constrained, reflecting the impact of the terminated Honda integration and the need for deeper structural reforms.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for FY2024 revenue was revised downward by ¥200 billion compared to Q2 due to higher marketing expenses and lower wholesales. Operating profit guidance was also reduced by ¥30 billion.
* Management’s confidence in achieving growth through strategic partnerships appeared less certain, reflecting the termination of the Honda integration discussions.
* Analysts shifted their focus from overall market performance to detailed cost-management strategies, highlighting concerns about Nissan’s ability to meet revised profitability targets.

### Risks and Concerns

* Challenges in the Chinese market, including declining retail sales and intensified competition from local brands.
* Rising variable marketing costs and Monozukuri expenses, coupled with inflationary pressures, continue to strain profitability.
* Potential impact of geopolitical risks, including tariffs on vehicles exported from Mexico to the US, remains a key concern.
* Execution risks associated with the turnaround plan, including workforce reductions, plant closures, and cost optimization efforts.

### Final Takeaway

Nissan’s Q3 2024 earnings call highlighted key challenges, including declining profitability, market-specific headwinds, and the termination of the Honda integration talks. The company has revised its FY2024 guidance downward but remains focused on structural reforms, workforce optimization, and new product launches to stabilize operations. While management emphasized the importance of strategic partnerships, analysts raised concerns about execution risks and long-term competitiveness in critical markets like North America and China.
