Steel and aluminium imports "are not very large as a share of the total", but they have wider implications as they signal the potential for a continued escalation in tariffs, Fitch’s BMI Research said Wednesday.

The latest set of tariffs means that more tariff pressures are building for the U.S. economy, which means that any additional tariffs (such as blanket tariffs on Mexico & Canada) would lead to the average tariff rate rising above 10% in the U.S, the brokerage said.

“The tariffs on steel and aluminium also pose more substantial downside risks to growth in Canada, given that the northern neighbour accounts for about 24% of all steel imports and 40% of all aluminium imports.”

BMI’s commodities team argues that similar to 2018/19, they expect that these tariffs will help to boost domestic production of steel, but it will be more of a challenge to significantly increase output.

“The U.S. aluminium industry is not globally competitive given that costs are too high, driven by expensive electricity and strict environmental regulations. In addition, aluminium imports account for about 50% of total demand, which suggests that there could be significant pass-through effects from a 25% tariff,” they added.

Steel imports are critical for industries requiring speciality grades not produced domestically, such as energy companies involved in wind development and oil drilling.

As such, President Trump’s [recent steel and aluminum tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405459-commodity-roundup-gold-prices-hit-record-high-as-trump-announces-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminium " recent steel and aluminum tariffs ") could also disrupt U.S. oil drilling, which relies on speciality steel not produced domestically, according to reports.

“The administration looks set to end carve-outs, quota deals, and exemptions for partner nations. The new tariffs, which the White House says will take effect on 4 March, will expand to cover a wide range of downstream metal products,” UBS said.

“Trump's team may be seeking to accelerate a renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade pact. Ultimately, we believe if these specific tariffs are imposed, the relative growth hit to the U.S. economy will be more manageable than the ones Mexico or Canada would face,” Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management added.
