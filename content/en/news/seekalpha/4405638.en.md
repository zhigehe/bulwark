The E.Coli outbreak took a bite out of McDonald’s (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) profits [last year,](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405526-mcdonalds-global-comp-sales-strength-offsets-u_s_-weakness-core-metric-misses-in-q4 "last year,") but the burger chain expects the damage will be behind it by the second quarter and profits will return to a “proper form.”

Fourth quarter results “did not meet our expectations,” CEO Chris Kempczinski conceded on the company’s earnings call, but the comparable sales and introduction of new offerings in the chicken portfolio and reintroduction of snack wraps is expected to fuel increased traffic and lead to a reinflation of the customer check.

Kempczinski also said that McDonald’s is “doubling down” on digital ordering and is on track to reach $250M active users and $45B in annual system-wide sales.

While demand remains soft among McDonald’s (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) major cohorts – low-income customers and families – the introduction of more value offerings, specifically the McValue platform is the key to driving up customer check, according to Evercore’s David Palmer, and elevate multiples in FY25.

"We continue to see a reinflation of check and ongoing traffic improvement -- particularly in the U.S. -- as the most likely stock catalysts as we look towards Q2," Palmer said in a note to clients.

As the company continues to broaden its value offerings, McDonald’s (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) has seen comparable sales running ahead of customer checks, a trend that is “consistent” with expectations. Eventually, however, the value offerings deliver a “one-two punch of comp and check growth which is what we are expecting to see in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said on the call.

Although there are still hurdles to overcome including challenges in its UK and Australian markets, as well as a foreign currency headwind that will negatively impact 2025 EPS by $0.20 to $0.30, McDonald’s fully expects its “resilient business model and overall financial strength” will put the company in the position “to succeed in any environment.”

McDonald’s ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) shares continue to gain ground and are now 4.5% higher, driving the stock to a 4-motnh high.
