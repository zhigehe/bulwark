Earnings Call Insights: RGC Resources (NASDAQ:[RGCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGCO "RGC Resources, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Paul Nester highlighted a strong start to fiscal 2025, with main extensions and renewal activity resulting in 1.1 miles of new mains and 197 new service connections. Total delivered gas volumes increased by 16% year-over-year, driven by higher consumption from a transportation customer and increased heating degree days.
* Nester emphasized steady housing growth in the region and ongoing expansion into Franklin County, where progress has been slower due to winter weather. The company expects more activity as construction season begins.
* CFO Tim Mulvaney noted that Q1 net income reached $5.3 million, or $0.51 per share, compared to $5 million, or $0.50 per share, in the prior-year period. Higher gas margins from rate increases offset lower equity earnings from affiliates and higher interest expense.
* Mulvaney also discussed plans to refinance a $25 million non-revolving line of credit maturing on December 31, 2025, with conversations with lenders described as positive.
* Nester reiterated RGC Resources' commitment to a capital spending forecast of $21.6 million for fiscal 2025, with potential adjustments in categories later in the year.
* Tommy Oliver, Senior Vice President, indicated that a recent rate case stipulation, based on a revenue increase of $4.08 million, is expected to mitigate inflationary pressures.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed fiscal 2025 earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.18 to $1.25. A more precise forecast is expected after the second quarter.
* The company anticipates steady growth in new service connections, supported by housing and commercial developments in the Roanoke Valley and Franklin County.
* Oliver noted that stipulated rates from the rate case are designed to address ongoing inflationary pressures, with projections through June 30, 2025.

### Financial Results

* Q1 net income was $5.3 million, or $0.51 per share, up from $5 million, or $0.50 per share, in the prior year.
* Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million, an 8.4% year-over-year increase, attributed to favorable weather conditions that allowed for progress in mains and services.
* Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were $854,000, down from $1.5 million in the prior-year quarter, due to the transition from construction to operational earnings for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP).
* Interest expenses increased $143,000 year-over-year due to higher average balances on the Roanoke Gas line of credit and higher rates on midstream debt.

### Q&A

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Capital spending in Q1 2025 was $5.7 million, compared to $22.1 million for the entirety of fiscal 2024, indicating steady progress on infrastructure investments.
* Management tone remained optimistic, with a focus on regional growth and infrastructure development, similar to the previous quarter.

### Risks and Concerns
