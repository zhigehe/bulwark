Earnings Call Insights: Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc. (NASDAQ:[ISSC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISSC "Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Shahram Askarpour highlighted a 70% year-over-year revenue growth for Q1 2025, driven primarily by new military programs and contributions from legacy platforms. Organic growth reached mid to upper single digits, supported by military end markets and improving trends in the commercial business. The company anticipates continued momentum across these sectors.
* Key investments during the quarter included the integration of a modern ERP system, expansion of the Exton, Pennsylvania facility, and support for the Honeywell acquisition, which added duplicative costs but is expected to drive future growth.
* The backlog increased significantly to $81 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $14.6 million in the prior year, reflecting strong demand across military and commercial platforms.
* CFO Jeff DiGiovanni stated, "We generated net revenues of $16 million in the first quarter, up just over 70%, when compared to the first quarter last year," driven by the Honeywell acquisition and organic growth. He also noted a gross margin of 41.4%, impacted by acquisitions, depreciation, and sales mix shifts.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated its projection of over 30% revenue and EBITDA growth for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.
* CEO Askarpour noted that the company remains "on track to deliver both revenue and EBITDA growth of over 30%" for the fiscal year, driven by investments in new programs and integration efforts.
* The transition of the Honeywell-acquired product line to IS&S's facilities is expected to complete by Q3 2025, which will mitigate duplicative costs and improve margins.

### Financial Results

* Q1 2025 revenues reached $16 million compared to analysts' estimate of $13.89 million. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04, falling short of the $0.15 analyst estimate.
* Gross profit for the quarter was $6.6 million, up from $5.5 million in Q1 2024, although gross margin declined to 41.4%, attributed to higher depreciation, duplicative costs, and a sales mix shift towards lower-margin military contracts.
* Backlog at quarter-end stood at $81 million, supported by new orders of $7.5 million and strong contributions from long-term military and commercial programs.
* Operating expenses increased to $5.3 million, reflecting investments in product development, Honeywell integration, and expanded workforce.
* Net income for the quarter was $0.7 million or $0.04 per share, compared to $1.1 million or $0.06 per share in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $3.1 million from $2.5 million last year.

### Q&A

* Gowshi Sri, Singular Research: Asked about strategies and investments to expand military market share. CEO Askarpour explained the focus on compliance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and investment in modern IT and ERP systems to position IS&S as a Tier 1 supplier to the Department of Defense.
* Doug Ruth, Lenox Financial Services: Queried about the balance between infrastructure spending and acquisitions. CFO DiGiovanni stated that "the building and strategic initiatives are being funded through operations and the company's credit facility," while maintaining a leverage ratio target of around three times.
* Andrew Rem, Odinson Partners: Asked about the timeline for Honeywell product line transition and benefits from the ERP implementation. CFO DiGiovanni explained that the transition is expected by Q3 2025, and the ERP system will provide better data for management decisions, reducing inefficiencies and labor costs.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the transition challenges and military market opportunities. Questions highlighted concerns over gross margin declines and duplicative costs but acknowledged the long-term growth potential.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strategic investments and their expected payoffs. CEO Askarpour remarked, "We are confident we are making the necessary investments to strategically position IS&S to win in the market."
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was consistent, with optimism about growth but acknowledgment of near-term margin pressures.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue increased from $15.4 million in Q4 2024 to $16 million in Q1 2025, reflecting 70% year-over-year growth.
* Gross margins declined further to 41.4% in Q1 2025 from 55% in Q4 2024, driven by higher depreciation and costs from the Honeywell acquisition.
* Backlog grew from $89.2 million in Q4 2024 to $81 million in Q1 2025, reflecting continued strong demand across programs.
* Management's tone remained focused on long-term growth, while analysts maintained cautious optimism, raising questions about margin recovery and military market challenges.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified near-term margin pressures due to depreciation and duplicative costs from the Honeywell acquisition. The transition of manufacturing to IS&S facilities is expected to mitigate these challenges.
* Analysts raised concerns about the longer sales cycles and procurement complexities in the military segment, which could impact growth timelines.

### Final Takeaway

While gross margins faced near-term pressures, management remains confident in achieving over 30% revenue and EBITDA growth for the fiscal year. Key investments in infrastructure, compliance, and ERP systems position the company for long-term success, with a focus on military and commercial market expansion. However, challenges related to integration costs and extended military sales cycles remain areas to watch.
