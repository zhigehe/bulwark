Earnings Call Insights: Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:[TAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TAP "Molson Coors Beverage Company")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Gavin Hattersley highlighted 2024 as a year of progress in advancing strategy and achieving bottom-line growth despite macroeconomic challenges. The company retained significant share gains from 2023, expanded shelf space for core brands in the U.S., and achieved strong growth across Canadian price segments.
* Over $1.2 billion in underlying free cash flow was delivered, with $1 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Hattersley emphasized confidence in the 2025 guidance aligned with the long-term growth algorithm.
* CFO Tracey Joubert reported a nearly 80 basis point expansion in underlying pretax income margin for 2024, citing pricing, mix impact, and cost savings as key drivers. She noted that $643 million was spent on share repurchases in 2024, representing 40% of the five-year $2 billion plan within just five quarters.
* Hattersley shared that Coors Banquet brand volume grew 16% in Q4, marking its 14th consecutive quarter of share growth in the U.S. The company also achieved double-digit growth in Canada’s above-premium portfolio, supported by Miller Lite and Madrí’s strong performance.

### Outlook

* Molson Coors issued 2025 guidance targeting low single-digit net sales revenue growth, mid-single-digit underlying pretax income growth, and high single-digit underlying EPS growth. Free cash flow is projected at $1.3 billion (+/- 10%).
* Annual price increases in North America are expected to align with historical averages of 1%-2%, with global above-premium portfolio expansion contributing to mix-driven growth. The company aims to reach one-third of global net brand revenue from above-premium offerings.
* Joubert noted cost tailwinds for 2025, citing moderating inflation, productivity improvements, and reduced contract brewing volumes.

### Financial Results

* Q4 consolidated net sales revenue declined by 1.9%, while underlying pretax income decreased 0.9%. Underlying EPS increased 9.2%, driven by tax benefits and accelerated share repurchases.
* U.S. brand volume declined 3%, with financial volume down 6.7% due to headwinds from the Pabst contract brewing exit. Despite this, Coors Banquet outperformed with 16% volume growth in the U.S.
* EMEA and APAC regions faced competitive pressures, particularly in the U.K., but achieved a 7.8% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter due to premiumization and pricing.
* For 2024, net sales revenue decreased by 0.6%, and underlying EPS grew by 9.8%, exceeding top-line guidance largely due to Q4 U.S. industry improvements.

### Q&A

* Christopher Carey, Wells Fargo: Questioned industry dynamics and Molson Coors' cautious approach to short-term trends. Hattersley emphasized improved Q4 performance but advised against drawing conclusions from limited data.
* Peter Grom, UBS: Asked about category growth assumptions. Hattersley noted steady trends in Canada and the U.K., highlighting premiumization opportunities.
* Filippo Falorni, Citi: Inquired about margin drivers and potential tariff impacts. Joubert emphasized positive net pricing, premiumization, and efficiency improvements, while Hattersley noted minimal exposure to U.S.-Canada tariffs due to localized production.
* Bonnie Herzog, Goldman Sachs: Asked about drivers of EPS growth. Joubert highlighted brewery efficiencies, marketing optimization, and savings from onshoring Peroni production.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analyst sentiment leaned toward cautious optimism, with recurring concerns about industry weakness and top-line growth sustainability.
* Management tone during prepared remarks was confident, emphasizing strategic progress and financial flexibility. Hattersley frequently cited “confidence” in achieving long-term goals.
* In Q&A, management maintained composure but adopted a more explanatory tone when addressing competitive and macroeconomic challenges.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts were less critical, reflecting improved Q4 performance and solid strategic execution.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted positively, with 2025 projections including high single-digit EPS growth compared to narrowed mid-single-digit guidance in Q3 2024.
* Strategic focus evolved from managing U.S. macro headwinds in Q3 to advancing premiumization and non-alcoholic beverage opportunities in Q4.
* Analysts in Q4 concentrated more on category dynamics and innovation execution, whereas Q3 discussions emphasized shipment timing and macroeconomic pressures.
* Management's confidence increased in Q4, supported by strong free cash flow and share repurchase progress.

### Risks and Concerns

* The U.S. beer category remains under pressure from value-seeking consumer behaviors and macroeconomic challenges, including inflation and interest rate impacts.
* Competitive intensity in the U.K. and ongoing softness in Central and Eastern Europe pose regional risks.
* Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of share gains and above-premium growth in the U.S., particularly given heightened promotional activities in some segments.
* Management’s mitigation strategies include driving efficiencies, investing in premiumization, and expanding non-alcoholic and beyond-beer portfolios.

### Final Takeaway

Molson Coors demonstrated resilience in Q4 2024, retaining significant U.S. market share gains and delivering strong above-premium growth in Canada and EMEA. With 2025 guidance aligned to long-term growth targets, including high single-digit EPS growth, the company is leveraging premiumization, cost efficiencies, and portfolio diversification to navigate industry challenges and drive shareholder returns.
