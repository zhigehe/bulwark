With the major indices remaining in uptrends despite headline volatility, Craig W. Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said investors should continue to see buying opportunities “for down-cap stocks, especially in value.”

The major indices have, however, fallen on Wednesday as the latest inflation report came in [stronger than expected](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406639-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market-cpi). The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) is currently -0.48%; the Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) is -0.33%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) is -0.6%.

Nonetheless, from a month ago, those indices are up 4.16%, 3.44%, and 5.17%, respectively.

“Despite the increased headline volatility surrounding earnings, inflation, and tariff concerns, we believe now is not the time for investors to retreat — instead, it is time to rotate,” said Johnson, in a note. “We continue to see buying opportunities for ‘down-cap’ stocks, especially in ‘value.’”

The Russell 2000 ([RTY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY "Russell 2000 Index")) is up 2.9% from a month ago, and about 2.4% from five days ago and 1% down today.

It has “pulled back from overhead resistance near 2,325/50-day moving average,” said Johnson. Its relative strength index has “eased to the midline. Add to positions on a confirmed topside breakout.”
