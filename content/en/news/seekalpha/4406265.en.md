Mentions of “AI” accompanied of the word “adoption” are at historical highs, getting close to 100 mentions, according to Morgan Stanley data, analyzing U.S. companies with more than $1B in market cap.

Earnings Transcript Mentions of "AI" + "Adoption" (AlphaSense, Morgan Stanley Research) 



Software (NYSEARCA:[XSW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XSW "SPDR® S&P Software & Services ETF")) is the main industry contributor to these mentions on earnings calls, Michael J. Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley, said in a note.

Also, Morgan Stanley strategists prefer software (NYSEARCA:[XSW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XSW "SPDR® S&P Software & Services ETF")) over semiconductors ([SMH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMH "VanEck Semiconductor ETF")) on an equally weighted basis, as software ([XSW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XSW "SPDR Series Trust - SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF")) continues to see strong earnings revisions.

In addition, Wilson said that the group “should continue to benefit as investor focus turns more toward AI adoption and the application layer.”

Here are some of the “AI” mentions by relevant companies:

Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) – "AI represents, for sure, the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the Internet."

Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) – "Based on the Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube delivered 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns."

Atlassian Corp. ([TEAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEAM "Atlassian Corporation")) – "These features are clearly delivering value as we're seeing the number of AI interactions increase more than 25x year-over-year. These powerful AI capabilities, along with automation and analytics, are also driving increasing adoption of premium and enterprise editions with sales to high value SKUs up over 40% year-over-year."

Lyft ([LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) – “The company said it has been using Anthropic's Claude AI model, through Amazon's Bedrock generative AI platform, which has helped reduce the average customer service resolution time by 87% and is resolving thousands of customer requests each day.”
