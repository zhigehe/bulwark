### Management View

* CEO Bill Hornbuckle highlighted MGM’s record annual domestic slot win, hotel revenue, and food and beverage revenue in 2024. He emphasized the company’s strong financial foundation and growth opportunities across digital and physical platforms. He noted that MGM is off to a strong start in 2025, with January revenues up in domestic operations and ADRs pacing for growth throughout the year.

Additionally, MGM recorded all-time high December slot handle and slot win, culminating in a record quarterly performance.
* CFO Jonathan Halkyard introduced new disclosures, including consolidated adjusted EBITDA and expanded reporting for MGM Digital, which saw net revenues grow 15% in Q4. He noted the capture of approximately $150 million in operational EBITDA opportunities for 2025, with 65% from expense initiatives.

### Outlook
