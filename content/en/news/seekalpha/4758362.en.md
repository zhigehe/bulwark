Summary
-------

Following [my coverage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4749991-lumentum-holdings-growth-should-remain-robust-due-to-cloud-and-ai-growth "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4749991-lumentum-holdings-growth-should-remain-robust-due-to-cloud-and-ai-growth") of Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:[LITE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LITE "Lumentum Holdings Inc.")) a few weeks ago, where I reiterated a buy rating due to my expectation that LITE remains well positioned to benefit from major secular trends, this post is to provide an update on my thoughts on the business and stock. The 2Q25 results further reinforced my view, particularly with its Cloud & Networking segment showing strong momentum. Given the accelerating investments in AI infrastructure and LITE’s expanding capacity to meet growing demand from hyperscalers, I upgrade my rating from buy to strong buy.

Investment thesis
-----------------

On 6th February 2025, LITE released its [2Q25 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19994931-lumentum-announces-fiscal-second-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1 "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19994931-lumentum-announces-fiscal-second-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1"), which saw revenue of $402 million, up 10% y/y and above the high end of the guidance range of $380 to $400 million. The main growth driver was the Cloud & Networking segment, which grew 20% sequentially due to high demand from hyperscalers. Gross margins came in at 32.3%, a 50 bps sequential decline, but operating margins saw 7.9%, which was a 490 bps sequential improvement. As a result, adj EPS saw $0.42, beating consensus expectations of $0.36. For 3Q25, management guided revenue to $410 to $425 million, implying another quarter of steady sequential growth.

LITE’s 2Q25 earnings validated my bull thesis, that LITE is in a very good position to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud computing, AI, and high-speed connectivity. If there is one thing that investors need to track to ensure the thesis is playing out well, it is whether LITE is winning demand from hyperscaler customers. Sure enough, it is. In the earnings call, management confirmed that LITE is now shipping high-speed transceivers to three hyperscaler customers. Production-level shipments of 800G transceivers have started with a second major customer, and a third hyperscaler is currently in the qualification phase, with initial shipments expected in 4Q25.

> In Q2, Datacom Transceivers revenue grew sequentially as expected, driven by an increase in shipments to our largest cloud hyperscale customer and the start of volume production shipments to one of our new customers we highlighted on prior calls. We continue qualification work with the other new customer and expect to start initial volume production during the fourth quarter, continuing to ramp through the first half of fiscal '26. [2Q25 earnings results call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755861-lumentum-holdings-inc-lite-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755861-lumentum-holdings-inc-lite-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript")

I strongly believe we are just at the start of this major investment cycle from hyperscaler customers. In just a few weeks (since I last wrote about LITE), there have been major developments in the industry that got me even *more bullish* on LITE. For instance, the [Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/ "https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/"), announced on 21st Jan 2025 (one week after my post), plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure across the US by 2029. For those that cannot imagine how massive $500 billion is, that is the entire [Singapore/Thailand GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29"). Notably, this initiative's aim is to construct extensive data centers to support advanced AI development, and this translates into demand LITE (like I have explained previously). Similarly, Europe has announced its own investment plans to stay competitive. For Europe, the plan is to invest EUR 200 billion, of which EUR 20 billion is dedicated to establishing AI gigafactories. France is also contributing to this momentum, with President Emmanuel Macron announcing a [EUR109 billion investment](https://www.ft.com/content/fc6a2d7a-5ed6-436e-84a5-dda86fc258d3 "https://www.ft.com/content/fc6a2d7a-5ed6-436e-84a5-dda86fc258d3") in AI infrastructure within the country. This initiative focuses on building computing clusters and data centers.

It is very clear that leading nations are pouring capital into this AI arms race. These substantial investments support my view that there will be accelerating demand for high-speed optical transceivers and related components (they are critical components for AI data centers to work).

In my previous note, I mentioned that LITE has made the right decision to expand its production capacity (double electro-absorption modulated laser [EML] by the end of 2025). In this earnings call, management has provided clarity on the exact timing of capacity expansion. LITE now expects to increase EML production capacity by 40% by 4Q25, followed by another 40% in 2H26. Notably, management noted that demand outstrips supply even after the capacity expansion. This implies that LITE’s EML business can potentially double its revenue by 2H26 (40% compounded twice is ~2x).

> We're still on track to what we've been saying, which was 40% or higher growth from the June quarter of calendar '24 to the June quarter of calendar '25, and then another 40% by the end of calendar '25. So that's for all 100 and 200 gig.​
> 
> I think we were in our prepared remarks, we talked about being overall supply constraint, not 200 gig, because we can start a 200 gig wafer or a 100 gig wafer just the same. So we're just -- overall, the demand is outstripping even that 40% compounded twice in an 18-month period of time. 2Q25 earnings results call

Valuation
---------

Own calculation



It seems to me that the market is still sleeping on this, as the share price did not react positively to the results. Based on my model (similar assumptions as my previous model), I think there is very attractive upside to LITE’s share. We know that demand is not the constraint, but supply is, and LITE is working hard to address this supply constraint. So long as LITE can expand its capacity as planned (no hiccups), expanded supply should translate into demand, thereby allowing it to grow at 18% easily (assuming 2Q25 revenue grows sequentially by a mid-single-digit through FY25).

As I said for valuation, historical multiples don’t matter anymore because of the significant changes AI has made to the industry. I quote this following portion from my previous note:

> Compared to peers that are exposed to the same tailwinds, like Macom Technology Solutions, Broadcom, and IPG Photonics Corp., which all trade at >30x forward PE with >20% revenue growth rates, I think LITE can continue to support at least 30x forward PE (LITE's slower revenue growth is compensated by its strong margin expansion).

Assuming that LITE trades at 30x forward PE, I have a price target of $129.

Risk
----

I reiterate the same risk since I wrote this just a few weeks ago:

> With LITE increasing its focus on direct relationships with hyperscalers, the company becomes more reliant on a small number of large customers for significant portions of its revenue. Furthermore, supply constraints, particularly in EML production, could limit the LITE’s ability to meet demand.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, my rating for LITE has been upgraded to strong buy. The 2Q25 results confirmed that LITE benefits from this growing investment for AI datacenter demand. It appears to me that the market may not yet fully appreciate this. Per my model, I believe the stock offers attractive upside, with my price target at $129 based on a 30x forward PE.
