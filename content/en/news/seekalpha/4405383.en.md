Growth in oil production from the Permian Basin is [expected to slow by at least 25%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-permian-basins-oil-output-growth-slow-2025-despite-trumps-plan-executives-say-2025-02-06/) in 2025 despite President Trump's pledge to boost U.S. output, energy executives said this week at the Argus Global Crude Summit in Houston.

Oil output is still expected to increase this year by 250K-300K bbl/day from the top producing U.S. oilfield, but down from last year's 380K bbl/day increase, as drillers prioritize returns to investors and capital discipline over expanding production as the sector matures. 

Chevron's (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) Permian production rose 14% Y/Y, the company reported in its [Q4 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401292-chevron-non-gaap-eps-of-2_06-misses-by-0_05-revenue-of-52_23b-beats-by-3_82b), to a record 992K boe/day, but "we are predicting closer to 9%-10% over the next couple of years, continuing to grow our production there but not necessarily at the same rate that we have done in the past," Barbara Harrison, VP of crude supply and trading, said at the conference.

"Drill, baby, drill is not going to happen," Coterra Energy ([CTRA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRA "Coterra Energy Inc.")) executive Shannon Flowers said. "The tension that we have right now is that the Trump administration said it wants lower energy prices. That's not necessarily good for producers."

Prospects for new terminal construction, a sure bet not long ago, is now [weighed by uncertainty](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/08/chevron-says-fading-us-crude-growth-casts-pall-on-port-projects/) after exports of U.S. crude in 2024 expanded at a slower pace.

"I think it was a matter of when" prior to the global pandemic, but now "there's more of a question now of if" such projects will be built, Harrison said.

Four U.S. projects are currently on the drawing board to build terminals capable of loading supertankers off the Gulf Coast, but Enterprise Products Partners ([EPD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD "Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units")) co-CEO Jim Teague [said this week](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402942-enterprise-products-says-not-enough-customer-interest-for-sea-port-crude-export-project) that commercialization of the Sea Port Oil terminal has not attracted enough "traction," and that the company would "move on" if volumes, fees and terms are not achieved in a reasonable amount of time.
