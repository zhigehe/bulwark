Baidu (NASDAQ:[BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU "Baidu, Inc.")) said that its AI chatbot—Ernie Bot—will be available for free to all users starting April 1, a move to help the Chinese search giant regain momentum in the AI race, *Bloomberg* reported.

The AI service will be accessible on desktop and mobile platforms at no cost.

Baidu (NASDAQ:[BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU "Baidu, Inc.")) is facing increasing competition in China's AI sector, especially from companies like DeepSeek that shook the AI industry in 2025.

Baidu’s Ernie was among the first batch of Gen AI platforms to win Beijing’s approval for public rollout, the report [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/baidu-takes-big-step-to-catch-up-by-making-ernie-ai-model-free "said"). The no-charge move potentially intensifies competition from major domestic players like Alibaba Group ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) to ByteDance ([BDNCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNCE "ByteDance")).

Baidu's stock in Hong Kong climbed as much as 7.9% following the announcement.

The company also plans to [launch](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406635-baidu-plans-to-launch-next-generation-ai-model-in-2025 "launch") the next generation of its AI model, Ernie 5, in the second half of this year.
