Biogen (NASDAQ:[BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")) shares traded flat in the premarket on Wednesday after the Alzheimer’s drug developer reported better-than-expected Q4 2024 financials while its full-year outlook disappointed due to its [underperforming multiple sclerosis franchise.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406750-biogen-beats-q4-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-fy25-outlook)

However, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech’s Alzheimer’s therapy Leqembi developed with Eisai ([OTCPK:ESALF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESALF "Eisai Co., Ltd.")) ([OTCPK:ESAIY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESAIY "Eisai Co., Ltd.")) posted about $87M of global in-market sales, including ~$50M in U.S. in-market sales in Q4, compared to ~$67M and ~$39M of in-market sales in Q3, respectively.

“We believe 2024 was an important year on our journey to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We delivered continued revenue growth from our ongoing product launches, including LEQEMBI, where we believe there remains a significant long-term opportunity,” said CEO Chris Viehbacher.

Meanwhile, the company's Q4 topline expanded only ~3% YoY to $2.5B as product revenue from its multiple sclerosis franchise fell ~8% YoY to $1.1B, compared to ~a ~9% YoY drop in the preceding quarter.

In the rare disease franchise, Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, generated $421.4M with a ~2% YoY improvement, while Friedreich's ataxia therapy Skyclarys, added from its $7.3B acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals last year, brought $102.2M in revenue.

Zurzuvae, a depression therapy Biogen (NASDAQ:[BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")) developed with Sage Therapeutics ([SAGE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAGE "Sage Therapeutics, Inc.")), added ~$22.9M in revenue, compared to $1.6M in the prior year quarter.

Meanwhile, BIIB’s bottom line expanded ~17% YoY to $3.44 of adjusted earnings per share, expanding its full-year adjusted earnings by ~12% YoY to $16.47 per share.

As for guidance, the company warned of a mid-single-digit percentage YoY decline in its 2025 revenue due mainly to deteriorating multiple sclerosis product revenues. Meanwhile, the midpoint of its $15.25–$16.25 of adj. earnings per share guidance for 2025 missed [$16.24 in the consensus.](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB/earnings/estimates)
