Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) continues to work with Chinese company Baidu to develop AI features for iPhones in China even after bringing in another local partner Alibaba (NYSE:[BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")), The Information reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Shares of Baidu rose about 4% premarket on Thursday, while Alibaba's stock dipped about 1%. Apple's stock was largely flat. The Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba closed at HK$116.70, about +2.5% higher.

The [report](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-continues-to-work-with-baidu-on-ai-features-for-iphone-in-china "report") comes on the heels of Alibaba Group Chairman Joe Tsai confirming on Thursday his company's AI partnership with Apple.

"They talked to a number of companies in China. In the end they chose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple," Tsai said at the World Government Summit in Dubai, according to a [report](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/alibaba-chairman-confirms-ai-partnership-with-apple-chinese-iphones-2025-02-13/ "report") by Reuters.

The collaboration was first [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406133-apple-alibaba-to-bring-ai-to-iphones-in-china-report "reported") by The Information on Tuesday. Apple and Alibaba have submitted the AI features to China's cyberspace regulator for approval. In China, AI products require regulatory approval before being they are launched for public use. In addition, Chinese regulations require Apple to collaborate with a local company to develop any AI applications for consumer use

Specifically, Baidu has been developing an AI-powered search feature which can handle images and text and upgrades to the Chinese version of Siri voice assistant, according to the report from The Information.

The features are part of a portfolio of functions called Apple Intelligence, which has been released by Apple in the U.S. and several other countries, but not in China.

Apple and Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

In December 2024, it was reported that Apple Baidu were [collaborating](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4362636-apple-baidus-ai-team-up-in-china-see-hurdles#hasComeFromMpArticle "collaborating") to add AI features to iPhones sold in China but the two companies were facing some difficulties. Engineers from the companies were working to use Baidu's large language models, or LLMs, so they work well for iPhone users. However, the models struggled to understand prompts and give correct responses to common scenarios posed by iPhone users.

Apple’s cooperation with both Baidu and Alibaba shows how the U.S. tech giant is hedging its bets by teaming up with more than one player in the Chinese market for AI, where the company has been facing tough [competition](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4396590-apples-iphone-sales-fell18-in-china-in-q4-amid-huawei-competition-counterpoint "competition") from local [smartphone](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4395589-apple-loses-top-spot-to-local-rivals-in-china-smartphone-shipments-for-2024-canalys "smartphone") makers such as Huawei Technologies and Vivo.

Apple Intelligence relies on a mix of Apple’s own AI models and a collaboration with Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation"))-backed OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.
