Earnings Call Insights: AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE:[ATR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATR "AptarGroup, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Stephan Tanda highlighted that Aptar achieved 2% core sales growth in Q4 2024 and delivered adjusted EPS of $1.52, exceeding the top end of guidance due to better-than-expected operational performance and a lower tax rate. He noted strong demand for pharma proprietary drug delivery systems and food closure technologies as key drivers, along with productivity gains company-wide.
* The Pharma segment achieved 8% core sales growth for the year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35%. Tanda emphasized the segment’s growth being driven by emergency medicines, allergic rhinitis, and central nervous system therapeutics.
* He added that the Closures segment returned to its long-term target range in the second half of 2024, aided by innovation, a higher-value product mix, and plant utilization improvement.
* CFO Vanessa Kanu reported Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $195 million, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. She attributed the 27% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to strong margins and a lower tax rate of 13%.

### Outlook

* Aptar expects Q1 2025 adjusted EPS in the range of $1.11 to $1.19, including a $0.15 headwind from currency and tax impacts. The adjusted effective tax rate is anticipated between 25% and 27%.
* Tanda stated that in 2025, Pharma’s proprietary drug delivery systems will remain a growth leader, supported by emergency medicines and central nervous system therapeutics. Injectables are expected to see healthy demand growth through new capacity ramp-ups.
* He expressed cautious optimism for double-digit EPS growth in 2025, adjusted for currency and tax effects, driven by cost-efficiency measures and ongoing operational improvements.

### Financial Results

* Pharma’s Q4 core sales increased 4%, driven by a 15% rise in prescription products such as allergic rhinitis and emergency medicines. Consumer healthcare sales decreased 17%, impacted by weaker cold and flu season demand and inventory adjustments at customer levels. Injectables core sales declined 8% due to lower service revenue.
* Beauty core sales fell 3%, attributed to lower tooling sales and a decline in prestige fragrances. However, personal care and home care markets showed growth of 3% and 15%, respectively.
* Closures core sales rose 7%, led by a 9% increase in food closures and 10% growth in beverages. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 260 basis points to 16.1%.

### Q&A

* George Staphos, Bank of America, inquired about green shoots in China and the outlook for EPS growth in 2025. Tanda responded that local beauty brands are gaining share in China, and travel-related beauty demand is rebounding. Kanu stated that normalized tax and FX conditions could lead to double-digit EPS growth.
* Ghansham Panjabi, Baird, sought clarity on EPS headwinds and destocking trends in pharma. Kanu explained that the French tax changes would have a full-year impact and that FX headwinds might persist into 2025. Tanda noted sequential improvements in cough and cold inventory levels.
* Matt Roberts, Raymond James, asked about injectables growth and proprietary drug delivery systems. Tanda reiterated a strong pipeline for injectables and emphasized the secular growth of nasal drug delivery platforms.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts showed cautious optimism but raised concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, including FX and tax impacts. Questions focused on growth sustainability in pharma and beauty.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, highlighting operational improvements and a robust pipeline. However, the tone in Q&A was more cautious, particularly regarding near-term headwinds.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone showed consistent confidence, while analysts pressed more on the impact of external factors.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted slightly, with more emphasis on headwinds from FX and taxes compared to the prior quarter.
* Strategic focus remained on pharma growth and beauty recovery, with added commentary on injectables ramp-ups and cost efficiencies.
* Key financial metrics, such as adjusted EPS and core sales growth, showed consistent performance, but declines in consumer healthcare and prestige beauty were highlighted as concerns.
* Management confidence remained steady, while analysts appeared more cautious about external challenges.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified weaker demand in prestige beauty and nasal decongestants as short-term challenges.
* Currency fluctuations and higher corporate tax rates, particularly in France, were flagged as major headwinds for 2025.
* Analyst concerns centered on inventory management and destocking trends in pharma and beauty.

### Final Takeaway

AptarGroup delivered strong Q4 2024 results, driven by robust demand in pharma and closures, while facing challenges in beauty and consumer healthcare. Management remains optimistic for 2025, projecting double-digit EPS growth adjusted for currency and tax headwinds. Strategic investments in pharma innovation and operational efficiencies position the company for sustained growth, although macroeconomic uncertainties and short-term demand fluctuations warrant close monitoring.
