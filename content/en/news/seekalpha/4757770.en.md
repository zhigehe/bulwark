Strategy (NASDAQ:[MSTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR "Strategy")) is a company I first covered [last August](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718353-microstrategy-a-vote-on-the-uncertain-future-of-btc-mstr-stock). I discussed both its traditional software business and the moves it's made in recent years to build up its Bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) portfolio. As the operations don't seem to be a major consideration and that MSTR's real value is in the BTC portfolio, I concluded:

> In my view, the company fails to establish why BTC will reliably perform as other assets do. Stocks and bonds have earnings that can compound. Gold and art physically exist and at least have some utility. Despite a boom of AI and the tech to create software that large customers can utilize, this is the path MicroStrategy has chosen.

Overall, I couldn't reason why the stock should trade a premium to the value of its BTC and rated it a Hold. I debated whether or not it was worth reviewing again, and after Michael Saylor decided to take a victory lap by way of name change from [MicroStrategy to Strategy](https://www.strategy.com/press/microstrategy-is-now-strategy_02-05-2025), I figured I'd see if there was anything truly new to consider that would have him feeling so optimistic.

Ultimately, I don't think there is. The MSTR rally and continued premium to the BTC portfolio continues to perplex me, and I only see reason to rate the shares a Hold.

Aftermath Since August
----------------------

With full-year results out, I think my overall conclusion that the software business really isn't that important is supported by management's lack of focus on these aspects. Near the end of their [FY 2024 slideshow](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf8d808d9b8cebd37/blt368a52561cca7449/67a6719e87c84dbb6c17c436/strategy-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-presentation.pdf), they actually show the progression from the bread and butter to the BTC in the operating results.

FY 2024 Company Presentation





Revenues have remained flat within a usual range, but operating expenses climbed heavily, particularly in the latter half of 2024.

This isn't surprising, as the price of BTC increased and the company continued with their portfolio strategy.

Most of these increased expenses are paper losses. By taking advantage of digital asset impairment rules, they are able to write these off and grow their BTC portfolio without having to record a gain.

Cash Flow Statement (Q3 2024 Form 10Q)





While the 2024 Form 10K won't be out for a bit longer, the [Q3 Form 10Q](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf8d808d9b8cebd37/bltbeba79d9c0a127ef/6762f14d7a4882c8238f54e7/form-10-q_10-31-2024.pdf) does at least show that cash flow up to that point is negative, further indicating that the software business for which Strategy was previously known is no longer the point.

What I find truly fascinating, however, is what happened to the total returns of both MSTR and BTC since I last covered it. BTC was already rallying after Trump came out in support of it in July. It's not surprising that it rallied further, finally breaking $100K, when he won the election. It's also not surprising that MSTR would go up too.

MSTR vs. BTC Total Returns (Seeking Alpha)





Nevertheless, I am amazed that MSTR returned more than 140% in that time, compared to BTC's 60%. In August, the value of the BTC portfolio was about $14B, while MSTR's market cap was around $25B. Despite already trading at a premium to the BTC, it appreciated more in response to the gain in BTC.

Examining the BTC Yield Strategy
--------------------------------

This was something that I discussed before, and I'll go over it again. The company claims to be creating value through a mechanism known as "BTC Yield."

 [![Screenshot](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/59452134-1739392913374436.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/59452134-1739392913374436_origin.png)

The slide above illustrates what they mean by this. While I'd normally think of BTC yield as coming from a cash account, denoted in BTC and that pays interest in BTC (it is a crypto**currency**, after all), that's not what Strategy means. BTC yield is an *effective result* derived from their ability to raise capital through ATM offerings of MSTR. If they acquire individual units of BTC faster than they increase the number of shares outstanding, that's the "yield."

The slide above shows just how much equity they have been selling in recent months to execute this strategy.

They aren't just selling shares. They've also been issuing convertible debt. The 2027 notes were converted, while 2029 notes were issued, working out to be not much different than if they had sold MSTR directly.

They've even been mixing it up a bit with a foray into convertible preferred stock. The type of security is technically different, but it's all using public markets to raise cash for the purchase of BTC, and it can always be turned into shares of MSTR.

Future Outlook
--------------

The long-term results of MSTR, therefore, depend on the BTC yield. Last time, I described valuing MSTR as an exercise similar to that of valuing Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc."))/([BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")). I will return to that comparison to elaborate my thoughts on MSTR and why I have doubts about its long-term value.

First, let's consider how Strategy and Berkshire are similar:

* Valuations largely depend on the portfolio (not operations)
* Both are C-corps (share prices not tied to NAV like an open-end fund)
* Premium to portfolio value is possible (market belief in growth potential)

There are also some stark differences:

* Strategy is known for selling it shares (directly or through convertibles)
* Berkshire is known for buying back its shares

The differences, I think, actually say a lot. A major part of Berkshire's return over time has been the growth of a single share's intrinsic value through the buybacks. Selling shares usually risks destroying shareholder value through dilution.

An exception exists if the proceeds are used to make capital investments that improve the fundamentals of the business. As MSTR proceeds are used to buy BTC, the BTC yield has to be improvement in the fundamentals for this to work.

I think, however, that coining terms like "BTC yield" over-complicates what is a simple process. We know that one of Berkshire's biggest holdings is Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")). Suppose Berkshire realized that its shares were worth twice (or more) the value of its portfolio and began selling more BRK to accumulate more KO. Imagine how strange it would be if they described this as "KO yield."

It seems to me that Strategy knows the shares trade at a premium, and so they take advantage to get easy capital. If the BTC appreciates afterward, that's great. To call that "BTC yield" and treat it like something more sophisticated strikes me as unwarranted. Adding layers to it through the issuance of convertible securities doesn't change the big picture for me either.

I'll add that it makes sense for Strategy to do this. If their shares are worth substantially more than the market value of an asset that they believe will appreciate, I expect them to sell MSTR to buy BTC. If MSTR crashes below the value of the portfolio, I'd also expect them to sell BTC and buy back MSTR.

FY 2024 Company Presentation





It's really that simple. People buying MSTR don't really have a reason to purchase it (as opposed to BTC outright) at what has usually been a 2:1 value premium, but MSTR does have reason to sell the shares.

The one exception is if Strategy could leverage this large BTC position to generate a source of earnings that currently doesn't exist. They did tease this in the Q4 2024 [earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755350-microstrategy-incorporated-mstr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript):

> We leverage our development capabilities to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications and integrating analytics experience with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, our strategic Bitcoin reserve, and our focus on technological innovation positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value-creation.

It's nothing specific. At this point, we just have to hope that earnings happen. With the recent BTC NAV of $46.1B compared to MSTR's $80B market cap, that suggests the shares would need to be below $187 before they became better than buying BTC outright.

Conclusion
----------

Strategy has been correct on the appreciation of BTC. It's unsurprising that shares of MSTR have generally gone up because their portfolio is more valuable from this. I take issue with the idea that selling shares at a premium to the portfolio to buy more creates "BTC yield," any more than Berkshire doing the same would create "KO yield" with more shares of Coca-Cola.

Without a source of earnings (something Berkshire has) to support this BTC accumulation, it's not clear why those who believe in BTC would aim for MSTR instead of buying the BTC directly. It just doesn't make sense to me. That's why, even after all the good news for MSTR, I continue to rate it a Hold.
