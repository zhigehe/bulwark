UBS upgraded European equities ([VGK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGK "Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF")), ([IEV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEV "iShares Europe ETF")), ([IEUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEUR "iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF")), ([STOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX "STOXX Europe 600 Index")), ([FEZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FEZ "SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF")) to a tactical overweight.

According to UBS analysts, Europe ([STOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX "STOXX Europe 600 Index")) has moved to second place on the global scorecard, which looks at monetary conditions, economic momentum, valuation, positioning, regional risk appetite, and macro sensitivities to macro scenarios.

In addition, the potential ceasefire in Ukraine, earnings revisions vs. the world are improving, and less tight fiscal policy, are contributing factors to this upgrade.

“Earnings revisions relative to global markets are improving yet the markets are discounting a fall in earnings momentum,” said Andrew Garthwaite, chief global equity strategist at UBS, in a note. “The Consensus 2025 EPS growth for the Stoxx 600 ([STOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX "STOXX Europe 600 Index")) is 6.5% in 2025 – we are 7% below consensus for MSCI AC World ([ACWI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACWI "iShares MSCI ACWI ETF")) EPS and hence EPS for the Stoxx 600 ([STOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX "STOXX Europe 600 Index")) would have to be negative for EPS revisions to be worse than MSCI AC World ([ACWI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACWI "iShares MSCI ACWI ETF")).”

UBS forecasts the Euro ([FXE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXE "Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Trust ETF")) to depreciate to Euro/$0.99 by the end of 2025.

When it comes to a possible ceasefire deal in Ukraine – which UBS analysts believe likely – energy prices could lower.

“The Energy team highlight that the gas price would fall from estimated 58 to low 20s on a full deal that allows Russian gas to flow again and 30 if Russian gas is allowed to transit Ukraine compared to the baseline of 40 if no deal and no Russian gas passes via Ukraine,” Garthwaite said. “If the price of gas and thus electricity falls, then it clearly helps GDP growth and inflation (with electricity and gas accounting for 5% of Euro area CPI).”

Analysts have also upgraded European equities ([STOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX "STOXX Europe 600 Index")) due to growing risks in the U.S., which now, according to UBS, ranks bottom on its aggregate scorecard, down three places.

“The gap between Europe and U.S. GDP growth (year-over-year) is now closing and on UBS forecasts it closes to 0.7% year-over-year by end 2025, from a peak of 3.3% in 3Q2023,” Garthwaite said. “U.S. GDP growth slows to 1.9% year-over-year in 3Q2025.”

Also, the [“Trump winners” stocks](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4256387-expected-winners-of-trumps-victory-financials-oil-software-eastern-europe-banks-crypto) have outperformed 41% since early October, “so, a lot of the good news is in the price,” said Garthwaite.

He also said that the DeepSeek news, with the capital expenditures of hyperscalers at 18.6%, slowing relative earnings growth and revisions of tech stocks ([XLK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK "Technology Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")), means analysts are much more selective of tech ([XLK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK "Technology Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")).

“DeepSeek arguably helps non-tech more than tech ([XLK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK "Technology Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")),” he said. “Seventy percent of the time tech underperforms, Europe outperforms, and U.S. underperforms.”
