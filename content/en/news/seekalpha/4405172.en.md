Tech giants plan to spend billions of dollars to build their AI infrastructure, contrary to the frugal economics of Chinese startup DeepSeek's ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) AI model.

U.S. companies, including Alphabet's (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), Meta Platforms ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) have already spent billions in their last quarters, and plan a similar approach for 2025. Google and Amazon, which reported their quarterly results earlier this week, have big ambitions for AI. 

Alphabet's capital expenditure, or CapEx, in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $14B, mainly reflecting investments in its technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers, to help growth its business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind, according to Alphabet's CFO Anat Ashkenazi.

The Gemini AI bot maker plans to spend around $75B in 2025.

Ashkenazi [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754885-alphabet-inc-goog-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "said") on the company's [earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403045-key-takeaways-from-alphabet-earnings-after-in-line-revenues "earnings") call, "as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2025 with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of debt in the first quarter."

Meanwhile, Amazon spent $26.3B in CapEx in the [fourth quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404698-amazon-solid-q4-results-upstaged-by-soft-guidance-fx-risks "fourth quarter") and for the full year 2025 the company could end up spending about $100B.

Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755884-amazon-com-inc-amzn-q4-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript "said") on the earnings call, "we spent $26.3 billion in CapEx in Q4. And I think that is reasonably representative of what you could expect in the annualized CapEx rate in 2025."

While responding to a question that the CapEx could be around $100B, Jassy noted that "the vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS [Amazon Web Services]. It's -- the way the AWS business works and the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it." Jassy added that the company does not procure it unless it sees significant signals of demand.

"And so, when AWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign medium-to-long term for the AWS business," Jassy commented.

Last week, Meta [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753159-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#hasComeFromMpArticle "said") it anticipates full-year 2025 [CapEx](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4400840-microsoft-metas-plans-for-ai-infrastructure-sends-allied-stocks-surging "CapEx") to be in the range of $60B to $65B, up from an expected $52B. The company expects CapEx growth in 2025 to be driven by increased investment to support its generative AI efforts and its core business, according to Meta's CFO Susan Li.

Microsoft already [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4392444-microsoft-says-it-will-spend-80b-in-data-centers-in-2025 "announced") its intention last month to spend around $80B for data centers in fiscal 2025. Microsoft's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella was also upbeat about AI on the company's earnings call last week. "Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals, [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753157-microsoft-corporation-msft-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript#hasComeFromMpArticle "said") Nadella.

Last week, Fitch Ratings said that DeepSeek's AI model [highlighted](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401566-deepseek-ai-impact-could-result-in-more-sustainable-ai-spending-fitch "highlighted") the risk of AI infrastructure overcapacity if the current speed of investment continues. The rating agency also said that this development could moderate outsized revenue growth for AI chipmakers but lead to more sustainable AI infrastructure investment, limiting the severity of an eventual downturn.

Tech stocks [plunged](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399000-nvidia-broadcom-lead-tech-stocks-lower-amid-deepseek-ai-impact#hasComeFromMpArticle "plunged") on Jan. 27, after DeepSeek last month [unveiled](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398699-chinese-ai-lab-deepseek-rattles-silicon-valley#hasComeFromMpArticle "unveiled") its AI model R1 and detailed in a paper how large language models, or LLMs, could be built on tight budgets and improved without human supervision. Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) saw around $589B in market cap [erased](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399188-nvidia-rebounds-after-record-589b-market-cap-rout#hasComeFromMpArticle "erased") on Jan. 27.

However, the Chinese app is being [restricted](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404232-deepseek-being-blocked-by-south-korean-ministries-on-security-risk "restricted") for use in several countries amid data security concerns.
