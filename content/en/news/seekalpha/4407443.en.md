Nathan's Famous (NASDAQ:[NATH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NATH "Nathan's Famous, Inc.")), the fast-food chain that began as a nickel hot dog stand in 1916 in New York City's Coney Island, is said to be considering a sale, the *Financial Times* reported.

The talks are preliminary, people familiar with the matter told *FT*, and the company may not finalize a [deal](https://www.ft.com/content/ee970afc-2d3f-447a-b573-5c68699610d1 "deal"). Potential buyers include private equity firms and major food manufacturers.

Howard Lorber, executive chairman of Nathan's Famous (NASDAQ:[NATH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NATH "Nathan's Famous, Inc.")) and former head of real estate broker Douglas Elliman, owns nearly a quarter of the fast-food chain's shares.

Nathan's Famous ([NATH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NATH "Nathan's Famous, Inc.")) [runs](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9520106 "runs") four company-owned restaurants and has 240 franchise locations as of the end of 2024. It's also popular for its Fourth of July hot-dog eating contest, held annually at its original location on Coney Island.

But its product licensing segment accounts for most of its revenue, under which it sells its branded products - ranging from hot dogs to French fries - through supermarkets and grocery stores.

The company's market capitalization is currently $357.4M, and its shares have climbed 31% over the past year.
