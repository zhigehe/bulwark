E-commerce company Amazon.com (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) is set to pay $3.95M in [settlement charges](https://oag.dc.gov/release/ag-schwalb-secures-395-million-amazon-resolve "settlement charges") connected to a lawsuit alleging stealing of tips intended for workers.

The settlement charges include $2.45M in penalties and $1.5M in costs.

Amazon allegedly misled consumers of the District of Columbia by assuring them that 100% of the tips will go to Amazon Flex delivery drivers. However, most of the tips were used to reduce the company's labor costs and increase profits.

Amazon launched its fast delivery Amazon Flex service in 2015, and encouraged consumers to tip their delivery drivers.

In 2016, the company changed its driver payment model so that a large portion of the tips were used to cover a portion of the base wages promised as pay to the drivers.

Amazon allegedly hid this change from consumers.

The Office of the Attorney General filed a lawsuit in 2022, alleging that Amazon violated the District's consumer protection laws.

The company had reimbursed Amazon Flex drivers for the misappropriated tips as part of a previous restitution-only settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. However, the OAG brought its lawsuit for injunctive relief and civil penalties under District law.

"It's not sufficient, after being caught, to simply give back the ill-gotten gains. Rather, there must be meaningful consequences to deter misconduct from happening in the first place," said Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb.
