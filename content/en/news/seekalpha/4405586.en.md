BlackRock (NYSE:[BLK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLK "BlackRock, Inc.")) converted its high-yield municipal bond fund into an [active exchange-traded fund](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996636-blackrock-bolsters-municipal-bond-suite-with-launch-of-high-yield-muni-etf "active exchange-traded fund"), creating the iShares High Yield Muni Active ETF (HIMU), the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.

The new ETF seeks to maintain identical investment objectives and fundamental investment policies as its predecessor mutual fund, which was launched in 2006 and delivered top quartile performance over the one-, five-, ten- and fifteen-year periods as of Dec. 31, 2024.

“Today’s higher interest rate environment provides a generational opportunity to capture income, particularly in the municipal bond market,” said Pat Haskell, head of the Municipal Bond Group at BlackRock. “Through the ETF wrapper, HIMU aims to take advantage of the attractive yield levels and strong credit quality in municipal bonds, delivering alpha to our clients in an efficient and transparent manner.”

As of Jan. 28, 2025, BlackRock (NYSE:[BLK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLK "BlackRock, Inc.")) managed $37B in assets across 50 U.S.-listed ETFs.
