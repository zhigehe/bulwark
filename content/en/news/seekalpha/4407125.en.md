### Management View

* Jay Bray, CEO, highlighted pre-tax operating income of $235 million and a 15.8% operating ROTCE. He emphasized the significant impact of the Flagstar mortgage banking acquisition, which added 1.1 million customers and marked the largest acquisition in the company's history. The servicing segment generated $318 million in pre-tax income, up 39% year-over-year, while originations saw a 38% sequential increase in funded volumes.
* The company achieved notable milestones, including the Freddie Mac SHARP Gold Award and a Fitch upgrade to a 1 minus rating for its master servicing business, reflecting strong operational performance.
* CFO Kurt Johnson reported a net income of $204 million, including significant items such as a $22 million charge for facility shutdown costs and a $9 million reserve release related to the Home Point acquisition. He also noted a tangible book value of $71.61 per share and a liquidity position of $3.4 billion.
* President Mike Weinbach highlighted the full rollout of the AgentiQ AI tool in the servicing call center, analyzing 400,000 calls monthly to enhance efficiency and customer experience. He also noted the company's top-five position in the correspondent lending market, achieved through platform enhancements and strategic client relationships.

### Outlook

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 pre-tax operating earnings reached $235 million, with the servicing segment contributing $318 million, driven by portfolio growth and operating leverage. The segment benefited from $59 billion in UPB acquisitions, partly offset by $18 billion in strategic sales to subservicing clients.
* Originations delivered $47 million in pre-tax income, supported by a 48% sequential production increase in the correspondent channel and expanded client relationships.
