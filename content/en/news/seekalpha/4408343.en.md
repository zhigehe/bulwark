### Management View

* CEO Denise Paulonis highlighted the company's momentum, with both Sally and BSG segments delivering positive comparable sales growth for the third and fifth consecutive quarters, respectively. She noted that the Fuel for Growth program contributed to gross margin expansion and improved profitability, with gross margin up by 100 basis points year-over-year.
* Paulonis discussed the Sally brand refresh, revealing plans for a modernized brand expression to roll out in the second half of fiscal 2025. She mentioned that eight stores in Orlando are piloting the refresh, with positive customer responses, and an additional 20-25 store updates are expected in Q2.
* The Licensed Colorists OnDemand service expanded to over 75 licensed colors, with more than 4,000 weekly consultations. Paulonis noted that average orders for these customers are 23% higher than non-LCOD customers.
* CFO Marlo Cormier reported consolidated net sales of $938 million, a 0.7% increase despite a $6 million foreign currency headwind. Gross margin expanded to 50.8%, driven by reduced shrink and lower logistics costs.

### Outlook

* Fiscal Q2 2025 guidance includes flat comparable sales and adjusted operating margins between 8% and 8.3%. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to impact net sales by approximately 100 basis points.
* Full-year fiscal 2025 guidance was reiterated, targeting comparable sales growth of flat to 2% and adjusted operating margins between 8.5% and 9%. Paulonis expressed confidence in achieving these targets, supported by ongoing strategic initiatives.

### Financial Results

* BSG delivered net sales of $412 million, a 1.1% increase, with gross margin expanding by 30 basis points to 39.7%. Comparable sales rose by 1.4%, driven by expanded distribution and product innovation.
* Operating free cash flow totaled $57 million, bolstered by $44 million in proceeds from the sale of the corporate office. Net debt leverage dropped to 1.9x following $41 million in debt repayment.

### Q&A

* Oliver Chen, TD Cowen: Asked about the Q2 dynamics between Sally and BSG, as well as expectations for traffic and ticket. CEO Paulonis explained that BSG faced headwinds from prior-year load-ins and calendar shifts, while Sally saw uneven traffic trends. She noted strong performance marketing and innovation, particularly in color and nails, driving growth.
* Korinne Wolfmeyer, Piper Sandler: Inquired about full-year guidance amidst softer Q2 expectations. Paulonis reiterated confidence in meeting the guidance range, citing upcoming product launches and marketing campaigns.
