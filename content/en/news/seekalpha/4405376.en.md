Slowing oil production in the U.S. is casting a shadow over projects that are intended to expand the shipment of crude to markets overseas, a Chevron (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) executive reportedly told Bloomberg.

Chevron President of Supply and Trading Barbara Harrison [reportedly told Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-08/chevron-says-fading-us-crude-growth-casts-pall-on-port-projects) in an interview “that it was a matter of when” new terminal construction would proceed before the COVID-19 pandemic. 

However, according to Bloomberg, crude exports last year grew at the slowest rate in non-pandemic years.

“I think there’s more of a question now of if” the construction of the projects will go forward, Harrison was quoted as saying.

Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Seeking Alpha.
