Elliott Investment Management has acquired a stake in BP (NYSE:[BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")), Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

[The people reportedly said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-08/activist-elliott-said-to-build-stake-in-struggling-oil-major-bp) that the activist investor has built a significant stake in the British oil giant and is aiming to force it to consider major moves to boost shareholder value. 

Bloomberg reported it couldnâ€™t determine the size of the stake.
