Earnings Call Insights: CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:[CME](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CME "CME Group Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Terry Duffy highlighted that 2024 marked CME Group's fourth consecutive year of record volume, with an average daily volume of 26.9 million contracts, up 9%. All six asset classes experienced year-over-year growth, with significant contributions from interest rates, foreign exchange, metals, and agricultural complexes.
* Duffy noted international business growth reaching 7.8 million contracts per day, a 14% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the company reported $60 billion in daily capital savings across all six asset classes cleared.
* Commodities growth was a standout, with metals volume up 23%, energy up 17%, and agricultural products up 13%. The segment generated $1.7 billion in revenue for 2024, a 16% increase from 2023. Growth was driven by new client acquisitions, particularly among global multi-strategy hedge funds.
* CFO Lynne Fitzpatrick reported record financial results, including $6.1 billion in annual revenue for 2024, a 10% increase from 2023. Adjusted expenses were $1.59 billion, and the adjusted operating margin expanded to 68.3%. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was $2.52, exceeding analysts' estimates of $2.45.

### Outlook

* Management projects adjusted operating expenses for 2025 to be approximately $1.65 billion, including costs related to cloud migration. Capital expenditures are expected to total $90 million.
* A 10-basis-point surcharge on non-cash collateral will be implemented in April 2025, aiming to increase cash collateral usage. This and other fee changes could add 2% to 2.5% to pre-tax income, assuming consistent volume levels.
* Market data fees were increased by 3.5% at the beginning of the year, contributing to revenue growth.

### Financial Results

* CME Group generated Q4 revenue of $1.5 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $919 million.
* Market data revenue rose 9% to $182 million, reflecting steady demand for professional and retail data usage.
* Cash at the end of 2024 stood at $3.1 billion, with $3.8 billion in dividends declared during the year, including a variable dividend of $2.1 billion.

### Q&A

* Patrick Moley, Piper Sandler: Asked about the retail customer acquisition strategy and the rollout of futures trading with Robinhood. Julie Winkler, Chief Commercial Officer, stated that two-thirds of recent new client revenue stemmed from retail, with Q4 seeing a 6% increase in retail traders. Robinhood's ongoing phased rollout is expected to expand customer access gradually.
* Alex Kramm, UBS: Questioned capital allocation and buybacks. Fitzpatrick emphasized their opportunistic approach to share repurchases, viewing them as a third method to return capital to shareholders, alongside dividends.
* Michael Cyprys, Morgan Stanley: Asked about climate-related product development. Derek Sammann, Global Head of Commodities, highlighted strong growth in energy and agricultural markets driven by weather volatility and energy transition needs.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analyst sentiment was neutral to slightly positive, with questions focusing on retail expansion, competitive positioning in interest rates, and capital allocation strategy. Analysts emphasized CME’s strong financial results and client acquisition strategies.
* Management maintained a confident tone throughout, emphasizing operational strengths, financial discipline, and growth opportunities. CEO Duffy frequently expressed optimism about CME's competitive advantages and market positioning.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 2024 revenue growth of 6% decelerated compared to Q3 2024's 18% growth, but the company maintained record financial performance.
* Adjusted EPS of $2.52 in Q4 showed consistent growth from Q3’s $2.68, reflecting robust margin management.
* Management’s tone remained consistent with the prior quarter, emphasizing long-term investment in technology, such as cloud migration, and continued focus on client acquisition.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management flagged geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and potential changes in tariffs as ongoing risks influencing market volatility.
* Analysts raised concerns about the competitive landscape in interest rates, particularly from new entrants like FMX, but management underscored CME's strong position supported by tight bid-ask spreads and significant cost efficiencies.
* The 10-basis-point surcharge on non-cash collateral carries some uncertainty regarding customer adoption and financial impact.

### Final Takeaway

CME Group concluded 2024 with record-breaking financial and operational achievements, driven by broad-based growth across all asset classes. Looking ahead, the company plans to leverage its diverse product suite and capitalize on emerging opportunities in commodities and retail trading.
