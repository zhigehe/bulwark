Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:[FIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FIS "Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.")) shares tumbled 17% in Tuesday late morning trading after introducing 2025 guidance that implied a slower-than-expected acceleration in revenue, in addition to mixed Q4 2024 results.

The payment technology company sees [full-year 2025 adjusted EPS](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997769-fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms-accelerating-momentum "full-year 2025 adjusted EPS") of $5.70-$5.80, in-line with the $5.72 average analyst estimate and up from $5.22 in the prior year. Revenue for the year is expected to rise to $10,435M-$10,495M, trailing the $10.59B consensus, from $10.1B in 2024. And 2025 adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be $4,305M-$4,335M, vs. $4,362M Visible Alpha estimate.

For the first quarter of 2025, it expects adjusted EPS of $1.17-$1.22 (vs. $1.28 consensus); revenue of $2,485M-$2,510M (vs. $2.57B consensus); and adjusted EBITDA of $940M-$960M (vs. $1,014M Visible Alpha estimate).

â€œOur 2025 outlook reflects acceleration in the business as we look to further build on the foundations laid in 2024 and drive double-digit total returns," said CEO and President Stephanie Ferris.

Turning to Q4 2024 results, adjusted EPS of $1.40, topping the $1.36 expected, held steady from the previous quarter and rose from $0.94 a year earlier.

Q4 revenue of $2.60B, falling short of the $2.63B consensus, advanced from $2.57B in Q3 and $2.51B in Q4 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA rose to $1.12B in Q4 from $1.06B in Q3 and $0.94B in the year-ago period.
