### Management View

* CEO Rael Diamond highlighted the strong operational and financial performance in 2024, with near full occupancy rates and exceeding the same asset cash NOI target. The company delivered $425 million in real estate transactions, including $260 million in acquisitions and $165 million in dispositions.
* Diamond emphasized the addition of $300 million worth of high-quality real estate to the portfolio, including 1.2 million square feet of space across 14 projects, which contributed to NAV growth.
* The company announced its third consecutive annual distribution increase, effective March 2025, reflecting confidence in sustained growth.
* CFO Mario Barrafato noted that funds from operations for Q4 2024 were $188.2 million, or $0.26 per unit, driven by higher same-asset NOI and contributions from completed developments despite higher interest costs.
* COO Niall Collins reported a stable occupancy rate of 97.6% across the portfolio, with a 77% tenant retention rate and a 21.6% average rent spread on renewals.

### Outlook

* Erin Johnston projected stable occupancy and 2%-3% year-over-year growth in same-asset cash NOI for 2025. Annual FFO growth is expected in the range of $1.05 to $1.06 per unit, reflecting 2%-3% growth.
* The company plans to focus on industrial development and retail intensification as key areas of investment in 2025.
* Management also aims to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 7.5x and has addressed a significant portion of its 2025 bond maturity.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 FFO was reported at $188.2 million, or $0.26 per unit, marking a 2% increase from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher same-asset NOI and net FFO contributions from completed developments.
* Same asset cash NOI increased by $6.7 million, or 2.8%, with retail and industrial sectors contributing $4.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
* The company ended Q4 with an IFRS NAV of $14.07 per unit, reflecting a $25 million increase over the previous quarter.
* Key transactions included $80 million in real estate deals, such as the acquisition of a grocery-anchored retail center in Ottawa and a 50% interest in an industrial property in Halifax, both with long-term leases and strong NOI growth potential.

### Q&A

* Himanshu Gupta, Scotiabank, inquired about industrial same-asset NOI growth and occupancy trends. Johnston confirmed lower growth for 2025 due to geographical leasing dynamics but projected occupancy improvements to exceed 98.5% by year-end.
