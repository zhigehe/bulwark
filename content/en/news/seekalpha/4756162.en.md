Allete**: Investment Thesis**
-----------------------------

### Background

In my June 30, 2024, article, "[Allete, Inc.: BlackRock's Backdoor Takeover](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701679-allete-blackrock-backdoor-takeover "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701679-allete-blackrock-backdoor-takeover")", with the share price at $62.57, I discussed how shareholders in Allete could earn 12.3% per annum by holding through mid-2025. This was predicated on a successful outcome of the bid for all the shares of the company at $67 cash per share expected to settle in mid-2025, subject to shareholder and various regulatory approvals. The offer also indicated dividends would continue to be paid through to settlement.

Excerpted from the ALLETE, Inc. (NYSE:[ALE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALE "ALLETE, Inc.")) [2023 Annual Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000069/a202311-k.htm "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000069/a202311-k.htm"),

> On May 6, 2024, ALLETE and a partnership led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPP Investments”) and Global Infrastructure Partners (“GIP”), (the “partnership”), jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which the partnership will acquire ALLETE for $67.00 per share in cash, or $6.2 billion including the assumption of debt (the "Merger"). The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025 and is subject to the approval of ALLETE’s shareholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals including by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ("MPUC"), the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), and other customary closing conditions.

Subsequently, on August 21, 2024, the company filed an [8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000083/exhibit991specialmeetingre.htm "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000083/exhibit991specialmeetingre.htm") announcing,

> ALLETE shareholders approve the proposed transaction with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners. ALLETE continues to expect the transaction to close in mid-2025... Based on the preliminary vote count from today’s special shareholder meeting, approximately 97% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposed transaction, representing approximately 74% of all outstanding shares.

On December 19, 2024, the company filed an [8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000097/exhibit991pressreleasedate.htm "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66756/000006675624000097/exhibit991pressreleasedate.htm") announcing,

> ALLETE receives FERC approval for the proposed transaction with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners. Expects transaction to close in mid-2025.
