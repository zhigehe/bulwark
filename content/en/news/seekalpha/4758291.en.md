Antero Midstream (NYSE:[AM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM "Antero Midstream Corporation")) announced [free cash flow](https://www.anteromidstream.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/146/antero-midstream-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and) that actually exceeded what management guided to some years ago. Next year, management guided to still more likely free cash flow growth (after dividends) even with an increasing capital budget. This is better than many of us ever thought would happen over the next few years. Even Mr. Market, back when management stated that negative free cash flow would transition to positive free cash flow, had doubts as to how effective that idea would prove to be.

Capital Strategy
----------------

But management has been buying assets that were no longer needed by others. This not only proved to be a boon that showed itself as lower capital expenses, but it also increased free cash flow at a faster pace. This goes back to my idea that superior management will outperform, when most of us just do not expect that outperformance.

Antero Midstream Capital Budget Summary And Reuse Savings Example (Antero Midstream Fourth Quarter 2024, Corporate Presentation)





Note that the above slide highlights the compressor reuse savings. That kind of savings will show itself in future cash flow growth as well as above average profitability (as long as these savings happen often enough to be significant).

Like anything else, there are managements that only buy brand new equipment and leave shareholder money on the table by dumping older equipment because "why bother?". But there is decent used equipment in this industry that provides a good return if it is in decent shape. Many times, that used equipment market is not all that well organized. Therefore, there are often some big discounts on used equipment that this management has taken advantage of.

Antero Midstream More Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance (Antero Midstream Fourth Quarter 2024, Corporate Presentation)





Now depending upon how the fiscal year unfolds, there could be more savings ahead in the form of used equipment. It is likely part of the capital budget spending range. In fact, it may well exceed the range given.

Like anything else, the capital budget can be adjusted to reflect commodity price levels. But a good discounted used product may allow more capital projects even at lower commodity price levels.

Note that the leverage is already conservative by midstream standards. But past purchases enabled that conservative debt level and higher free cash flow levels (after dividends) than many of us thought possible at this time. I still remember comments about how that free cash flow level was years away.

Note also, that management has begun the increase in shareholder returns by conservatively repurchasing shares just in case that money is needed for future capital projects or even an opportunistic acquisition. It is far easier to justify less stock repurchases than it is to cut the dividend.

While it is possible using the lower point of the cash flow range that the free cash flow will not grow, that is most likely going to be due to an opportunistic acquisition or some other significant event.

Summary
-------

The priority list as to how this will be executed is shown below:

Antero Midstream Approach To Shareholder Returns (Antero Midstream Fourth Quarter 2024, Corporate Presentation)





Antero Midstream does not service the whole Antero Resources ([AR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR "Antero Resources Corporation")) operation. Therefore, Antero Midstream can grow faster than Antero Resources for some years to come.

The other consideration is that Antero Resources may decide to grow production if North American prices join the much stronger world natural gas pricing market. Should that happen, then Antero Midstream would likely grow faster as well.

Growth Ahead
------------

While growth is unlikely to be as fast as it was back when the company went public. It is probably reasonable to assume high single digit percentage growth into the future. An occasional opportunistic acquisition may fuel faster growth.

Antero Midstream EBITDA Growth History (Antero Midstream Fourth Quarter 2024, Corporate Presentation)





The history shown above, lends itself to an argument that this will continue to be a growth and income idea with a combined return in the lower teens. The financial safety is enhanced by the financial safety of the parent company (Antero Resources).

Summary Of Results
------------------

Net income was up because average fees per unit charged rose. Net income is a fraction of revenue. Therefore, a small increase in fees charged can make a decent difference in net income and free cash flow.

Antero Midstream EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Reconciliation To Net Income (Antero Midstream Fourth Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release)





Note also that the [tax expense](https://www.anteromidstream.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/146/antero-midstream-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and) climbed quite a bit on that additional income. That is likely a timing issue. Putting that figure back in to calculate EBITDA demonstrates that EBTIDA rose significantly in the current quarterly comparison. This is part of the reason for the free cash flow growth.

Free cash flow climbed because capital expenditures declined significantly compared to the year before.

The Future
----------

Antero Midstream remains a strong buy consideration based upon continuing single digit percentage business growth (one way or another) as well as the dividend yield. A return on this investment despite the stock price runup should be in the low teens.

That is probably a decent return given the financial health of the parent company. Much of the threat to any midstream idea often happens when the parent company is not doing well. Therefore, any threats to this business are on the low side.

The debt ratio of the midstream company is below 3. This is very low leverage for a midstream company. Yet the return on capital invested remains above average for the industry. This is often true of well managed companies. Management finds a way to make more money with the assets available.

Risks
-----

The biggest risk to any captive midstream company is a takeover of the parent company. The parent company largely controls the operations of the midstream. Therefore, a new owner of the parent company would have to be evaluated for effects on the midstream business.

There is a very low risk of the benefits (of increasing natural gas demand from the growth of data centers and the increasing use of natural gas to generate electricity combined with the growing ability of North America to export natural gas) of growing demand not being realized in the future in the form of higher natural gas prices. This may encourage Antero Resources to grow operations to the extent that Antero Midstream would grow faster.

A loss of key personnel could pose an above average challenge for the company to replace. This is a fairly profitable midstream company with low debt. A suitable replacement is likely to be a smaller subset of the people qualified for the open position that existed. Not many are able to maintain above average profitability when a talented individual is replaced.
