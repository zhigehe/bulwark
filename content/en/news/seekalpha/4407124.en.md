### Management View

* CEO Robert Sanchez highlighted Ryder's ability to deliver year-over-year comparable earnings growth for the first time in eight quarters, supported by double-digit earnings growth across all business segments. He emphasized the resilience of the transformed business model during the downturn and confidence in achieving further growth.
* Acknowledging key leadership changes, Sanchez announced John Diez as President and COO and Cristy Gallo-Aquino as CFO, highlighting their internal promotions as part of Ryder's talent development strategy.
* Sanchez noted an 8% increase in operating revenue for 2024, driven by acquisitions of Cardinal Logistics and IFS, which expanded capabilities in dedicated transportation and supply chain solutions.
* CFO Cristina Gallo-Aquino reported Q4 operating revenue of $2.6 billion and comparable EPS of $3.45, up from $2.95 in the prior year. She highlighted improvements in free cash flow, which turned positive at $133 million compared to negative $54 million a year earlier.
* Fleet Management Solutions saw an 8% growth in ChoiceLease revenue, although rental demand remained weak. Supply Chain Solutions achieved a 58% rise in earnings, driven by omnichannel retail performance and productivity gains. Dedicated Transportation Solutions recorded a 46% increase in operating revenue due to the Cardinal acquisition.

### Outlook

* Ryder projects 2025 comparable EPS in the range of $13-$14, reflecting a 17% increase at the high end. ROE is forecasted to rise to 17%-18%, supported by structural improvements and contractual earnings growth.
* The company expects operating revenue to grow approximately 2% in 2025, with muted growth due to freight cycle headwinds.
* Key drivers for 2025 earnings growth include $1 per share from FMS contractual business improvements and $0.85 from synergies in supply chain and dedicated segments. A $0.25 net benefit is anticipated from transactional businesses, assuming modest rental recovery.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 operating revenue was $2.6 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by acquisitions.
* Free cash flow improved to $133 million compared to negative $54 million in Q4 2023, reflecting lower capital expenditures.
* Fleet Management Solutions achieved a pretax earnings increase to $152 million, driven by ChoiceLease growth, though rental utilization slightly declined to 73%. Supply Chain Solutions reported an 8.9% EBT margin, while Dedicated saw a 7.1% margin despite integration costs.

### Q&A

* Christyne McGarvey, Morgan Stanley: Asked about revenue growth guidance amid muted growth expectations. CEO Robert Sanchez explained that the forecast assumes flat lease fleet growth and no significant freight market recovery in 2025.

* Jordan Alliger, Goldman Sachs: Questioned the drivers of revenue growth in supply chain and dedicated segments. John Diez, COO, pointed to sales headwinds from economic uncertainty but emphasized growth potential in industrial and retail verticals.
* Daniel Imbro, Stephens: Asked about margin recovery in Dedicated Transportation Solutions. Diez attributed improvements to Cardinal acquisition synergies and integration progress, targeting high-single-digit EBT margins in 2025.
