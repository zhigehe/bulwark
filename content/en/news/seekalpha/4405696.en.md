As Elon Musk's government efficiency group races ahead with its agenda to pare down federal government bureaucracy and hold agencies accountable, he supported the idea of auditing the Federal Reserve in a series of social media posts on Sunday.

"All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people," he wrote in a post on X. "No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve." 

His [post](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888583443962814811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1888583443962814811%7Ctwgr%5Ecefd7833df429829595dc66c68ac4dbe941ae699%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fmusk-suggests-closer-scrutiny-of-fed-as-powell-prepares-to-face-congress-160431678.html "post") was in response to another X user, Wall Street Apes, who stated that the Federal Reserve has "NEVER had a full audit, or full disclosure of monetary policy decisions." Note that the Fed releases minutes of its monetary policy meetings about three weeks after each meeting, and full [transcripts](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical_year.htm " transcripts ") after five years.

Musk also responded, "This will be great," to X user TaraBull, who said he is considering former congressman Ron Paul to lead the audit. Paul, who is 89, is known as a perennial critic of the federal government policies, and the Federal Reserve, specifically. He sought the U.S. presidency as a Libertarian in 1988. He was a Republican before 1987 and from 1996 through 2015.

The flurry of posts seeking closer scrutiny of the central bank comes as Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to [testify](https://www.senate.gov/committees/hearings_meetings.htm "testify") to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for his semiannual Monetary Policy Report. Expect him to field questions on the Fed's independence and how political considerations affect the central bank's decisions. (Powell consistently says that political considerations play no part in the Fed's monetary policy decisions.)
