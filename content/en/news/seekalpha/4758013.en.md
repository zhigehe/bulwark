Investment environment
----------------------

* Equity markets extended gains in the fourth quarter, building on strong performance through the first nine months of 2024.
* U.S. and global economic activity remained relatively solid, and earnings continued to grow for many companies.
* The November election sparked a strong rally fueled by expectations of reduced regulation and potentially lower corporate tax rates under the Trump administration. However, stocks faced December volatility as investors grew wary about the feasibility of the administration’s policy proposals.
* The Fed cut policy rates by 25 basis points in both November and December but indicated fewer cuts were likely in 2025. The 10-year Treasury yield ended the quarter higher on increased economic growth and inflation expectations.
* Market gains reflected a narrow advance: only four of 11 S&P 500 sectors posted gains; the equal-weighted S&P 500 lagged its market cap counterpart; and the Magnificent 7 tech stocks significantly outperformed the broader market.

Portfolio review
----------------

Semiconductor company Marvell Technology ([MRVL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL "Marvell Technology, Inc.")) was a top contributor to relative performance. The company's third-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Its expanded partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), driven by the growth of Amazon’s next generation Trainium AI chip, strengthened Marvell’s market position in AI semiconductors.

Online travel agency Booking Holdings ([BKNG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG "Booking Holdings Inc.")) was also among the top contributors. Amid resilient demand for travel, shares climbed higher following strong third-quarter results that exceeded expectations for both sales and earnings. The company raised full-year guidance, citing strength in room nights, alternative accommodations, and flights. The company's ability to consistently gain market share across the regions it operates and a renewed focus on cost efficiency and profitability have supported our outlook for the stock.

UnitedHealth Group ([UNH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated")), a health insurance and services company, was among the top relative detractors. Shares fell following CEO Brian Thompson’s tragic death in Manhattan and the ensuing backlash against the managed care industry. Despite this negative sentiment, the company maintained its 2025 guidance, and we believe UnitedHealth shows potential for growth in Medicare Advantage, where it faces reduced competition. Further, we believe its investment in AI coupled with its extensive database, positions the company well for future efficiency gains.

ASML Holding ([ASML](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML "ASML Holding N.V.")), a semiconductor equipment company, also weighed on performance. The stock declined after the company’s third-quarter earnings release showed new bookings below expected levels. While management lowered 2025 guidance due to uncertainty around China sales restrictions, the company maintained its long-term outlook.

We continue to see opportunity tied to ASML’s strong competitive positioning and the growing AI-driven demand for equipment to produce high-end components.

Manager outlook
---------------

Market conditions remain favorable as we enter 2025, supported by the Federal Reserve's accommodative shift with rate cuts in this cycle totaling 100 basis points thus far. While monetary policy is still restrictive, this move toward a more neutral stance, combined with moderate inflation, has generally been positive for risk assets, despite ongoing debate about the pace of future rate cuts.

The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience with sturdy GDP growth projected into next year and a strong labor market supporting consumer spending. Earlier concerns about a potential hard landing have largely dissipated, with discussions now centered on the likelihood of either a soft landing or no-landing scenario.

Further, the election results and the Trump administration's pro-growth policies have been viewed as market friendly. We anticipate an environment conducive to increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity and investment, supported by deregulation initiatives.

Importantly, a broad array of secular trends remain firmly intact and has continued to dictate market direction. We are seeing unprecedented levels of capital investment across multiple areas of the economy, particularly in AI infrastructure. Rising consumer adoption and demand for AI products and services could benefit companies in several sectors, from semiconductor chip makers and data centers to companies powering data centers and consumer-facing companies that engineer AI applications.

While generative AI leads the way, powerful sector drivers are also continuing in deglobalization, power generation, and digitization. These themes are creating opportunities tied to growth in domestic manufacturing, utility infrastructure development, e-commerce, and digital payments.

We maintain a constructive outlook but are mindful of elevated market valuations and that speculative areas of the market, like cryptocurrency, have spiked on election enthusiasm. Market breadth has narrowed considerably, with leadership concentrated among the largest technology companies.

While we continue to monitor market and macroeconomic trends, our primary focus remains on evaluating companies’ business models and identifying competitively advantaged companies in healthy, growing end markets.

Volatility measures risk using the dispersion of returns for a given investment.  Basis point (BP) equals 1/100 of a percentage point. 1 bp = 0.01%, 100 bps = 1%.  Monetary Policy refers to the policies of a central bank, aimed at influencing the level of inflation and growth in an economy. It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. The S&P 500® Equal Weight Index (EWI) is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500. The index includes the same constituents as the capitalization weighted S&P 500, but each company in the S&P 500 EWI is allocated a fixed weight - or 0.2% of the index total at each quarterly rebalance.  Please consider the charges, risks, expenses and investment objectives carefully before investing.

For equity portfolios, relative contribution compares the performance of a security in the portfolio to the benchmark’s total return, factoring in the difference in weight of that security in the benchmark. Returns are calculated using daily returns and previous day ending weights rolled up by ticker, gross of advisory fees, may exclude certain derivatives and does not represent actual performance.  **There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.**  **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Growth stocks** are subject to increased risk of loss and price volatility and may not realize their perceived growth potential.  **Funds** **classified** **as** **“nondiversified”** can take larger positions in a smaller number of issuers than “diversified” funds, which could lead to greater volatility.  **Technology industries** can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product cycles, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants, and general economic conditions. A concentrated investment in a single industry could be more volatile than the performance of less concentrated investments and the market as a whole.  **Russell** **1000®** **Growth** **Index** reflects the performance of U.S. large-cap equities with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values.  **S&P** **500®** **Index** reflects U.S. large-cap equity performance and represents broad U.S. equity market performance.
