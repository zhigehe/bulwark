### Management View

* CEO Alex Saigh highlighted a transformational year for Patria, surpassing the $5 billion fundraising target with $5.5 billion raised. Fee-related earnings (FRE) of $170 million were achieved, reflecting a 15% growth year-over-year. Saigh noted, "We are confident in our new three-year targets introduced at Investor Day," which include a $200 million to $225 million FRE target for 2025.
* Fundraising was diversified across multiple strategies, including $1.4 billion in credit and $2.3 billion in global private markets solutions (GPMS). The company emphasized a growing focus on local investors, with 70% of 2024 fundraising sourced locally.
* CFO Ana Russo stated, "We are pleased that we achieved our 2024 fundraising target," and highlighted that fee-earning assets under management ([AUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUM "Intl Sec Exch ISE Spot AUDUSD Index")) rose 38% year-over-year to $33 billion, with the FRE margin projected to expand to 58%-60% in 2025.
* The company highlighted significant performance-related earnings ([PRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRE "Prenetics Global Limited")) of $41 million in Q4, driven by the sale of Aguas Pacifico in Infrastructure Fund III. Saigh emphasized continued momentum in infrastructure realizations for 2025.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed a $6 billion fundraising target for 2025, attributing growth to diversified strategies and strong local investor participation. Saigh indicated that infrastructure and credit strategies will likely dominate due to macroeconomic conditions.
* The FRE target for 2025 was reiterated at $200 million to $225 million, supported by expected margin improvements and organic growth.
* Fundraising efforts will continue for Infrastructure Fund V and Private Equity Fund VII into mid-2025, with anticipated contributions from local and international investors.

### Financial Results

* Q4 adjusted EPS was $0.36 compared to analysts' estimates of $0.35. Revenue for Q4 2024 was $93.2 million vs. analysts' estimates of $92.3 million.
* Fee-related earnings reached $54.8 million, a 35% increase sequentially, supported by higher-margin incentive fees. Distributable earnings for the quarter were $89 million, reflecting strong performance across the board.
* Fee-earning AUM decreased 3% sequentially to $33 billion due to dollar appreciation but grew 38% year-over-year. Management highlighted that local currency performance remains robust, with net organic inflows of $380 million in Q4.

### Q&A

* William Barranjard, Itau BBA: Inquired about the breakdown of the $6 billion fundraising target and debt levels.
