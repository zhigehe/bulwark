He highlighted strength across customer segments, with leisure REVPAR growing 6%, business transient up 3%, and group REVPAR rising 3% globally.
* International markets demonstrated robust performance, with Asia Pacific REVPAR up 12.5%, led by Japan, India, and Thailand. EMEA region REVPAR rose 8%, while Greater China saw a smaller-than-expected 2% decline, showing sequential improvement.
* Marriott's development pipeline reached over 577,000 rooms, supported by the addition of 38,000 rooms from MGM and 9,000 from Sonder. The company noted significant growth in its midscale portfolio, with over 300 properties open or in the pipeline across brands like Four Points Flex and Studio Res.
* CFO Leeny Oberg reported a 7% increase in Q4 total gross fee revenues to $1.3 billion, driven by higher REVPAR, room additions, and a 13% rise in credit card fees. Adjusted EBITDA also grew 7% to $1.29 billion.

### Financial Results

* Q4 worldwide REVPAR rose 5%, exceeding prior expectations, with the U.S. and Canada up 4% and international markets up 7%.
* APAC led growth with 12.5% REVPAR gains, driven by strong cross-border demand and growth in key markets like Japan and Thailand.
