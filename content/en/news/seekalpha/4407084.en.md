Earnings Call Insights: First Quantum Minerals Ltd. ([OTCPK:FQVLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FQVLF "First Quantum Minerals Ltd.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Tristan Pascall highlighted the company's financial stabilization in 2024 following challenges at Cobre Panama through comprehensive refinancing efforts. He emphasized exceeding copper and gold production guidance for the year and noted strong progress on the Kansanshi S3 Expansion, which remains on schedule for mid-2025 completion. Pascall stated that priorities for 2025 include delivering the Kansanshi S3 project, strengthening the balance sheet, and resolving the Panama situation.
* Pascall provided updates on Cobre Panama, mentioning continued engagement with Panamanian officials and preparations for an environmental audit. He stressed the importance of securing approval for the Preservation and Safe Management program to address concentrate exports and environmental stewardship.
* CFO Ryan MacWilliam shared that net debt decreased by $61 million to $5.5 billion in Q4, supported by consistent operational performance. He highlighted liquidity of $1.6 billion, including $112 million in cash and $750 million in undrawn revolvers. MacWilliam stated that approximately 50% of copper sales are hedged through collars through 2025 to mitigate price volatility during the Kansanshi expansion ramp-up.

### Outlook

* The Kansanshi S3 Expansion is on track for mid-2025 completion, with a conservative ramp-up profile assumed for initial production from surface stockpiles. Full ramp-up is expected to progress throughout 2025.
* Management reiterated plans to resolve the Panama situation in early 2025, with engagement efforts ongoing. The environmental audit terms of reference were released, with further steps awaiting government instructions.
* Capital expenditures for 2025 are projected between $1.3 billion to $1.45 billion, including $100 million carried over from 2024 and $400 million for Kansanshi S3-related expenses.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter copper production totaled 112,000 tons, a modest decline from the prior quarter due to maintenance and lower grades at Sentinel. Full-year copper production, excluding Cobre Panama, reached 431,000 tons, exceeding the upper guidance range of 420,000 tons.
* Gold production for 2024 reached 139,000 ounces, surpassing the guidance of 135,000 ounces. Nickel production of 24,000 tons was within the guidance range.
* Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 were $0.14, marking the second consecutive positive quarter since the suspension at Cobre Panama.
* Copper C1 costs increased slightly to $1.68 per pound in Q4, attributed to lower production volumes and higher costs at Sentinel. Full-year C1 costs averaged $1.74 per pound, the lowest since 2021.

### Q&A

* Orest Wowkodaw, Scotiabank: Questioned the timing of Cobre Panama negotiations given delays in social security reforms and arbitration hearing extensions. Pascall clarified that the President remains focused on social security reforms but reiterated expectations of progress in early 2025. He added that arbitration delays are unlikely to affect negotiation timelines.
* Edward Goldsmith, Deutsche Bank: Asked about timeframes for environmental audit and balance sheet strategies. Pascall stated the audit's terms of reference have been finalized, and approval of the Preservation and Safe Management program is essential. MacWilliam noted a strong liquidity position and ongoing evaluations of financing options, including a potential minority stake sale in Zambia.
* Chris LaFemina, Jefferies: Inquired about power availability for Kansanshi S3 ramp-up. MacWilliam confirmed conservative sourcing plans to ensure sufficient power supply despite ongoing challenges in Zambia.
* Lawson Winder, Bank of America Securities: Asked about public outreach efforts in Panama. Pascall emphasized significant engagement efforts to educate the Panamanian public and address misinformation.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts maintained a neutral tone, seeking clarity on Panama's situation and Zambia's power challenges, while acknowledging the company's operational stability and progress on key projects.
* Management's tone was slightly optimistic during prepared remarks, emphasizing progress on the Kansanshi S3 project and financial stability. During Q&A, Pascall remained measured, particularly on the Panama discussions, frequently referencing the complexity of governmental processes.
* Compared to the previous quarter, there was a marginally more positive tone from management, reflecting confidence in achieving 2025 priorities.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language for the Kansanshi S3 Expansion remained consistent, with increased specificity on ramp-up timelines for 2025. Strategic focus shifted further toward resolving the Panama situation.
* Analysts continued to focus on power supply issues in Zambia, but there was more emphasis on the Panama situation compared to Q3.
* Management sentiment improved slightly due to positive financial results and operational achievements, while analysts remained cautious.
* Financial results showed a slight decline in quarterly production but exceeded full-year guidance for copper and gold.

### Risks and Concerns

* Delays in resolving the Cobre Panama situation remain a key challenge, with potential impacts on concentrate exports and environmental compliance costs. Management highlighted the urgency of securing government approvals.
* Power shortages in Zambia pose a risk to Kansanshi's operations, particularly during the S3 Expansion ramp-up. Management has implemented conservative sourcing strategies to mitigate disruptions.
* Rising labor and maintenance costs could impact cash cost guidance for 2025 and 2026, partially offset by elevated gold byproduct credits.

### Final Takeaway

First Quantum Minerals exceeded full-year production guidance for copper and gold, reflecting strong operational performance across its Zambian operations. The Kansanshi S3 Expansion remains on track for mid-2025 completion, with management adopting a conservative ramp-up approach. The resolution of the Panama situation and securing reliable power for Zambian operations are key priorities for 2025. Financial stability has improved, supported by reduced net debt and strong liquidity, positioning the company for continued growth.
