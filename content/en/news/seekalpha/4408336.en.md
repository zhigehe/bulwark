Earnings Call Insights: DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:[DXCM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXCM "DexCom, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Kevin Sayer, CEO, highlighted that Q4 2024 organic revenue growth was 8%, contributing to a full-year organic growth of 12%, aligned with guidance. The company ended 2024 with over 2.8 million global customers, an increase of approximately 25% compared to 2023, driven by strong demand for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.
* DexCom launched Stelo, its over-the-counter product, which attracted over 140,000 users within four months. Expansion plans include introducing Stelo on Amazon in Q1 2025 and enhancing the platform through generative AI and strategic partnerships like ÅŒURA.
* International growth was supported by new reimbursement wins, including DexCom ONE+ basal insulin coverage in France, and the company sees significant potential in expanding CGM access globally.
* CFO Jereme Sylvain reported Q4 revenue of $1.11 billion and net income of $177.8 million or $0.45 per share. U.S. revenue grew 4%, while international revenue increased by 17%, driven by expanded availability of G7 and DexCom ONE+.
* The company incurred a $21 million non-cash charge related to mishandled inventory and production yield issues but expects supply levels to normalize by Q1 2025.

### Outlook

* DexCom projects 2025 revenue of $4.6 billion, representing 14% growth. This forecast assumes strong demand for CGM systems, expanded reimbursement coverage, and a second-half launch of a 15-day G7 product.
* Gross profit margins for 2025 are expected to improve by at least 200 basis points, reaching a range of 64% to 65%, supported by scale efficiencies and product advancements.
* The company plans to pursue coverage for an additional 20 million U.S. type 2 diabetes patients not currently on insulin.

### Financial Results

* Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.45 compared to analysts' estimate of $0.50. Revenue was $1.11 billion vs. analysts' estimate of $1.10 billion.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $300.1 million or 27% of revenue, down from 31.1% in Q4 2023. Operating income was $209.5 million, reflecting an 18.8% margin.
* Gross profit margin was 59.4%, affected by inventory and production issues, but improvements are expected as the company transitions to high-volume manufacturing.
* The company closed the year with $2.6 billion in cash, providing flexibility for growth initiatives.

### Q&A

* Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo, inquired about progress on U.S. sales force and DME channel issues. Kevin Sayer responded that sales force productivity has improved, with a 50,000 prescriber increase in 2024 and record new patient starts in Q3 and Q4. DME relationships have stabilized, with efforts to balance channel volumes.
* Jeff Johnson, Baird, asked about narrowing the gap between U.S. volume and revenue growth. Jereme Sylvain detailed plans for convergence through 2025, citing improving rebate dynamics and channel stability.
* Robbie Marcus, J.P. Morgan, discussed the impact of the 15-day G7 sensor. COO Jake Leach expressed confidence in FDA approval by mid-2025, with a second-half launch anticipated. He noted that integration with pump partners is designed to be efficient.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed positive sentiment about improved sales force productivity and strong international growth but highlighted concerns over channel mix and rebate headwinds. Questions frequently focused on U.S. market recovery and new product impacts.
* Management maintained a confident tone, pointing to record customer growth, expanding coverage, and progress on resolving operational challenges. Kevin Sayer emphasized long-term growth potential and near-term execution improvements.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts' tone shifted slightly more positive due to clear progress on earlier challenges, while management reiterated confidence in achieving 2025 targets.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison
