Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee called the January Consumer Price Index data "sobering" when the inflation [rate came in hotter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi " rate came in hotter ") than expected on Wednesday. But don't read too much into any one report, he said.

January data often includes seasonal quirks, and it followed two months of more "encouraging" inflation reports, he said in an interview with the *New York Times.*

The 3.3% Y/Y core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, provides further evidence that the Federal Reserve has a way to go to reach its 2% inflation goal.

"There’s no question, if we got multiple months like this, then the job is clearly not done," Goolsbee said in the interview on Wednesday. As head of the Chicago Fed, he gets to vote on monetary policy this year.

The data backs the Fed's pause on rate cuts. Indeed, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank [will leave rates on hold](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406899-powell-says-fed-has-not-been-in-contact-with-musks-doge-house-hearing "will leave rates on hold") until there is further evidence that inflation is coming down to 2%. Traders, too, are now expecting [to wait even longer](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407027-only-one-fed-rate-cut-expected-in-2025-after-hot-january-inflation-data "to wait even longer") for the next cut.

Goolsbee still expects that interest rates will settle to a "fair bit below where we are today," he said in the interview, but, like Powell, he'll require more "confidence that we are on the path to 2% inflation" for the next rate reduction.

He said President Donald Trump's tariffs may make it more difficult to discern what's part of the trend and what's a one-time event. "We’re going to be in the uncomfortable situation of trying to distinguish what component of the increase in prices is coming from a thing that we should look through and what is a sign of overheating," he [said.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/inflation-cpi-report-january.html?searchResultPosition=1 " said ")
