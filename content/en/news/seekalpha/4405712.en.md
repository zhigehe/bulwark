Although the U.S. is still the leading country behind biotech innovation, China is close behind, according to a Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:[JNJ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ "Johnson & Johnson")) business development executive.

Nauman Shah, global head of business development for Johnson & Johnson Business Development, said that he was very impressed with the innovation he saw during a business trip to China in December. 

Speaking at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference in New York City, Shah said that China's biotech innovation is particularly strong in oncology and immunology.

"Our philosophy for China is....if we see outstanding innovation there, we will go after it," he said, adding that such a deal would need to be structured in a way to consider geopolitical and trade concerns.

Shah noted that J&J has done deals in other parts of Asia, and cited a [late-2023 deal](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4050539-jnj-janssen-signs-licensing-deal-worth-up-to-1-point-7-billion-with-legochem "late-2023 deal") with South Korean company LegoChem for an antibody-drug conjugate asset for up to $1.7B as an example.
