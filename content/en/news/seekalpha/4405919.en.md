* Stora Enso [press release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997533-stora-enso-financial-statement-release-2024-improved-results-in-challenging-markets) ([OTCQX:SEOJF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEOJF "Stora Enso Oyj")): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of -€0.81.
* Revenue of €2.32B (+6.9% Y/Y).
* Adjusted EBIT increased to €121 million. Adjusted EBIT margin increased to 5.2%.
* Cash flow from operations amounted to €325 million.
* Net debt increased by €540 million to €3,707 million, mainly due to the board investment at the Oulu site.
* The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 3.0. The target to keep the ratio below 2.0 remains.
* **Outlook:** In the first quarter of 2025, maintenance costs are expected to decrease to €64 million from €118 million in Q4/2024, due to no major planned maintenance activities in the quarter.
* **During the full year 2025**, the Group's adjusted EBIT is anticipated to be adversely impacted by approximately €100 million, primarily in H1/2025, due to the ramp-up in the coming months of the new packaging board line in Oulu, Finland.
* The Group's capital expenditure forecast for the full year 2025 is €730–€790 million.
