Earnings Call Insights: Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:[NWL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWL "Newell Brands Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Chris Peterson, CEO, highlighted notable progress in 2024, including a 460 basis point increase in normalized gross margin to 34.1% and a 210 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin to 8.2%. Core sales trends improved across all six business units, with annual growth in the Baby, Writing, and Commercial segments. The company also delivered $500 million in operating cash flow, reducing its leverage ratio to 4.9x.
* Peterson emphasized advancements in the company’s tariff mitigation strategy, reporting that China-sourced goods now account for only 15% of cost of goods sold and are expected to drop below 10% by the end of 2025.
* Peterson outlined a focus on innovation for 2025, including new product launches such as the Graco SmartSense Soothing Bassinet and Swing, EXPO enhanced dry erase markers, and the Oster Extreme Mix Professional Blender. He also highlighted efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing and leverage its competitive advantage.
* Mark Erceg, CFO, stated, "Q4 normalized diluted EPS came in at $0.16, above our guidance range of $0.11 to $0.14." He noted 350 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4, marking six consecutive quarters of improvement.

### Outlook

* Management provided preliminary 2025 guidance, projecting normalized operating margins of 9% to 9.5%, representing an improvement of approximately 110 basis points. Core sales are expected to range from -2% to +1%, with net sales anticipated to decline by 4% to 2%, impacted by foreign exchange and business exits.
* Peterson stated, "We expect sequential improvement, with the first half being down low single-digits and the back half turning slightly positive."
* Plans to invest more in A&P as a percentage of sales were cited as a sign of confidence in an improved innovation funnel and stronger structural economics.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter core sales declined 3%, aligning with guidance. Normalized gross margin expanded to 34.6%, a 350 basis point year-over-year increase, supported by productivity savings and pricing actions. Net interest expense rose to $72 million.
* Full-year normalized EBITDA grew 15%, driven by strong margin performance. Operating cash flow reached $496 million, enabling the company to reduce net debt by $175 million.
* Normalized diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.16, exceeding analysts' estimate of $0.14.

### Q&A

* Bill Chappell, Truist Securities, asked about assumptions for 2025 category growth. Chris Peterson responded that categories are expected to be flat, with innovation and distribution expansion driving potential share gains.
* Lauren Lieberman, Barclays, questioned the potential impact of tariffs. Peterson noted that the company’s strong U.S. manufacturing base could provide a competitive advantage, stating, "We have significant U.S. manufacturing capability, including writing, coolers, food storage, and candles."
* Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan, inquired about pricing contributions. Mark Erceg explained that pricing added about one point to Q4 results, driven by international markets addressing currency devaluation.
* Brian McNamara, Canaccord Genuity, asked about returning to core sales growth. Peterson emphasized the ramp-up in innovation, distribution expansion, and improved market share trends.
