Net lease REIT W. P. Carey (NYSE:[WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")) is expected to report higher AFFO from last year in its Q4 earnings results on Tuesday, February 11th, after market close.

The [consensus FFO estimate](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly) is $1.19 (+22.35% Y/Y) and the consensus revenue estimate is $404.27M (-1.98% Y/Y).

"Our fourth quarter results are expected to benefit from rent recoveries received in October, totaling approximately $0.04 of AFFO, which had been previously factored into our guidance," CFO Toni Sanzone had [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731115-w-p-carey-inc-wpc-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript) during the Q3 earnings call.

**Last Quarter**

The net lease REIT [delivered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4220850-w-p-carey-narrows-2024-affo-guidance-range-after-q-3-results-beat) stronger-than-expected top and bottom lines for Q3 2024, but the figures slid from last year.

Lease revenues [fell to](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4220735-w-p-carey-in-charts) $334.0M from $369.2M in Q3 2023.

The ~10% year-over-year decline was mainly a result of executing WPC's strategic plan to exit the office assets within its portfolio, including the NLOP spin-off in November 2023 and dispositions under the office sale program during 2023 and 2024.

W. P. Carey guided on 2024 AFFO per share of $4.65-$4.71, trailing the $4.72 consensus and compared with the prior outlook of $4.63-$4.73.

**Analyst Thoughts**

The net lease REIT, with about 25% of its portfolio being retail and more than 60% being industrial, was looking to increase its retail portfolio to over 30%.

The company expects to acquire assets in 2025 without the need to issue equity, BMO Capital Markets said in a recent note.

"WPC has proposed the sale of its operating storage business ($58.8M of 3Q24 annualized NOI), student housing ($5.7M of NOI), and various non-core asset sales to partially fund acquisitions," the note said.

Scotiabank views the Q4 investment updates in the case of WPC positively, signaling ample acquisition opportunities if investment spreads are maintained.

"We expect WPC to finance investments with debt, FCF, and dispositions (including Student Housing and Self Storage operating assets)," said Scotiabank's research note.

**Ratings**

The [average sell-side analyst rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC/ratings/sell-side-ratings) on the stock is a Hold. A total of 9 analysts out of 14 rated WPC as Hold in the last 90 days.

Seeking Alpha's [Quant Rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC/ratings/quant-ratings) system also grades W. P. Carey as Hold, with a C- on Growth and C on Momentum.

Meanwhile, [SA authors](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC/ratings/author-ratings) rate the stock as Buy.

"Strong diversification across different tenants and geographic markets, combined with long lease terms and the mission-critical nature of WPC's properties, make WPC a pretty low-risk REIT," [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4751267-w-p-carey-strong-yield-and-growth-is-resuming) SA contributor Jonathan Weber.

"WPC won't make anyone rich quick, but between some growth, an undemanding valuation, and a nice yield of 6.5%, the return outlook is far from bad, and the risk-to-reward ratio seems quite appealing," said Weber.

The stock has lost 2.07% in the last one year.
