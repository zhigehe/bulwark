Morgan Stanley has upgraded Cytokinetics (NASDAQ:[CYTK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYTK "Cytokinetics, Incorporated")) to overweight from equal weight while lowering its price target, adding that the stock's risk/reward has skewed to the upside.

The bank noted the shares have been driven down by investor concerns, particularly about the REMS program for aficamten, but that those concerns are now "better understood."

It added that shares could move even lower in 2025 "as the setup for the aficamten REMS program continues to evolve," but that it sees multiple opportunities for upside over the next 12 months, including MAPLE-HCM study results and potential FDA approval for aficamten.

"We think CYTK shares are worth meaningfully higher than current levels, and for those who have a longer time horizon past 2025, we think the chances increase even more that higher valuations could be achieved," the investment bank added.

Morgan Stanley lowered its price target for the stock to $67 from $70.
