* Goldman Sachs upgraded their investment rating on Japan's Panasonic Holdings ([OTCPK:PCRFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCRFF "Panasonic Holdings Corporation")) to "buy" from "neutral."
* They believe the company's low current valuation offers "a compelling investment opportunity as a value stock."
* "We see potential for the company to generate strong cash flows as its high capex and growth investments in automotive batteries and Blue Yonder wind down, and that this combined with benefits from structural reforms could increase investor expectations for large-scale buyback," the research firm said.
* Panasonic shares in Japan have a price target of JPY 2,500, hiked from JPY 1,770, implying a 40% upside.
