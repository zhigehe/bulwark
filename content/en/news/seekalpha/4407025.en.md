Earnings Call Insights: Oatly Group AB (NASDAQ:[OTLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OTLY "Oatly Group AB")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Jean-Christophe Flatin highlighted that while 2024 constant currency revenue growth came in at 4.8%, below guidance, adjusted EBITDA was at the favorable end of the range, reflecting improved profitability. He emphasized Oatly’s transformation into a stronger business with enhanced margins and profitability, achieved through a simplified supply chain, reduced workforce, and strategic focus on profitable growth.
* CEO Flatin announced the closure of the Singapore facility and halted construction of the second Chinese plant, consolidating manufacturing to five global plants with a production capacity of 900 million liters. This shift enables capital expenditures of $30 million to $35 million, approximately 4% of revenue.
* CFO Marie-José David noted, "We continue to believe that our business plan remains fully funded with our path to profitable growth." She also emphasized the progress made in improving gross margins and reducing SG&A expenses.
* COO Daniel Ordoñez shared that North America achieved double-digit growth in retail and food service, excluding its largest customer, which saw food service sales grow by 22%. The Barista portfolio continues to act as the largest growth driver with a 13% increase in Europe and international markets.

### Outlook

* Management guided constant currency revenue growth of 2%-4% for 2025, accounting for an anticipated 300 basis-point headwind from sourcing changes at its largest U.S. customer. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $5 million and $15 million.
* Plans to achieve profitable growth include leveraging brand momentum, driving efficiencies, and managing costs. CEO Flatin stated, "We will continue to aggressively pursue cost efficiency to drive margin expansion, simplify operations, and reinvest in growth."

### Financial Results

* Revenue for 2024 grew by 5.1%, driven by volume growth of 8.8% year-over-year. However, gross margin expanded by 930 basis points for the full year, with a 540-basis-point increase in Q4 alone, attributed to absorption and supply chain improvements.
* Adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $6.1 million in Q4 and $35.3 million for the full year, reaching the favorable end of guidance.
* Free cash flow improved to a $156 million use of cash in 2024, a $319 million improvement since 2022, marking the best performance since Oatly’s IPO.

### Q&A

* Kaumil Gajrawala, Jefferies: Questioned gross margin drivers for 2025. CFO David explained improvement would come from optimizing the production footprint, global sourcing, and product mix. She noted progress towards long-term gross margin targets of 35%-40%.
* Max Davenport, BNP Paribas: Asked about opportunities to drive category growth amid recent sluggishness. COO Ordoñez stressed Oatly’s focus on converting new consumers by addressing taste barriers and misinformation around nutritional value. He stated, "Oatly did it once, and we are decisively going to do it again."
* Elsa Evans, JPMorgan: Inquired about 2025 EBITDA improvement cadence. CFO David outlined growth expectations from new markets, reduced promotional activity in Europe, and integrated brand investments to accelerate growth in the second half of the year.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on category sluggishness and the ability to drive new household penetration. However, they acknowledged Oatly’s differentiated performance and cost-efficiency measures.
* Management displayed confidence in their strategic initiatives, emphasizing efficiency gains and brand momentum. CEO Flatin reinforced commitment to profitable growth, while COO Ordoñez highlighted progress in the food service channel and Barista portfolio growth.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone during the Q&A was more focused on addressing headwinds and providing clarity around operational strategies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 revenue growth of 2%-4% represents a shift from the prior quarter’s projection of 6%-10% growth for 2024, reflecting sourcing changes with a key U.S. customer.
* Adjusted EBITDA guidance transitioned from a loss range in 2024 to positive $5 million-$15 million in 2025.
* Management’s tone displayed increased confidence in achieving profitable growth, supported by supply chain recalibration and cost reductions.
* Analysts remained consistent in questioning category growth potential, though management provided more granular insights into marketing strategies and operational efficiencies compared to the previous quarter.

### Risks and Concerns

* Sourcing changes at the largest U.S. customer, impacting 300 basis points of growth, present a challenge.
* Sluggish category growth in key markets like Europe and the U.S. remains a concern.
* Rising misinformation on oatmilk’s nutritional value could hinder customer conversion efforts, though management plans to address this through partnerships with healthcare professionals and targeted campaigns.

### Final Takeaway

Oatly’s strategic focus on supply chain efficiency, disciplined cost management, and targeted marketing initiatives underpins its 2025 guidance for profitable growth. Despite challenges in category dynamics and sourcing headwinds, the company anticipates achieving constant currency revenue growth of 2%-4% and adjusted EBITDA of $5 million-$15 million, supported by improved margins and consumer conversion efforts.
