Earnings Call Insights: Microbix Biosystems Inc. ([OTCQX:MBXBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBXBF "Microbix Biosystems Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Cameron Groome reported revenues of over $6 million for Q1, noting that this represents a 40% growth in recurring business compared to the same period last year, excluding prior year’s nonrecurring milestone payments. Gross margins expanded to 62%, attributed to operational efficiencies and manufacturing rigor.
* CFO Jim Currie highlighted the company’s strong cash position, bolstered by warrant and option exercises in January that brought nearly $3 million in cash. He also noted the continuation of share buybacks, with $2.5 million shares repurchased over the past four months.
* COO Ken Hughes emphasized improvements in manufacturing processes, including reduced batch failures and increased yields, which contributed to margin growth. He also noted progress in the recombinant antigen program, with products expected to launch before the fiscal year-end.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated its guidance for 20% to 40% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, driven by strength in antigens and quality assessment products (QAPs). They expect QAPs development revenues to remain below 25% of the total for the year.
* CEO Groome outlined the significance of upcoming recombinant antigen launches, which aim to expand addressable markets and support internal products like QAPs.
* CFO Currie expects operating expenses to remain stable, with no significant increases anticipated for the remainder of the fiscal year.

### Financial Results

* Q1 revenues of over $6 million compared to analyst estimates of approximately $5.8 million. Gross margins reached 62%, up from 49% in the prior year when adjusted for nonrecurring items.
* Net earnings were reported at $856,000, marking a strong bottom-line performance. Management credited a combination of recurring sales growth, operational efficiencies, and reduced expenses.
* Share buybacks and strong cash inflows were highlighted as important financial milestones.

### Q&A

* An analyst inquired about the slowdown in QAPs revenue. CEO Groome explained this was due to a shift in customer strategy from parallel to sequential assay development, which is expected to normalize by Q3 and Q4.
* On recombinant antigens, questions focused on market advantages and margins. COO Hughes noted that recombinant products would address previously inaccessible markets, with margins varying based on production methods and product complexity.
* Regarding Kinlytic, COO Hughes confirmed that the program is on schedule, with a contract drug manufacturing organization selected, and additional CDMO contracts expected in the first half of 2025.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential U.S. tariffs. CEO Groome indicated minimal exposure, noting that most products are critical and sticky, with alternatives being limited.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing questions on potential risks like QAPs delays and tariff impacts. Their tone was slightly skeptical regarding customer project timelines and recombinant antigen profitability.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly in prepared remarks. CEO Groome frequently emphasized operational progress and market expansion, using terms like “strong growth” and “excellent progress.”
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone has shown increased confidence in achieving revenue and margin targets, supported by operational efficiencies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue growth sustained at 40%, consistent with Q4 2024. Gross margins improved significantly from 55% in the previous quarter to 62% in Q1 2025.
* Strategic focus shifted toward recombinant antigens and expanding QAPs into oncology and genetic testing markets.
* Analysts in the previous quarter emphasized antigen growth in emerging markets, while this quarter’s focus included QAPs delays and margin sustainability.
* Management’s confidence has notably increased, particularly regarding recombinant antigen launches and Kinlytic progress.

### Risks and Concerns

* Potential delays in QAPs projects due to customer strategy shifts were acknowledged, though management expects recovery by Q3.
* U.S. tariffs could impact approximately 5% of revenues, with management outlining mitigation strategies like direct shipments to non-U.S. destinations.
* Analysts highlighted development risks in recombinant antigens, though management remains confident in its competitive advantages.
