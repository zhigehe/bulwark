U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he would announce plans for "reciprocal tariffs" next week, marking another step up in his administration's trade war with major economic partners. The move would mean the completion of a promise Trump made during his election campaign last year. 

Trump spoke to reporters in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. When asked whether he would target the world's third-largest economy with tariffs, Trump said he will be going with "mostly reciprocal tariffs" where "a country pays so much or charges us so much, and we do the same."

"I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday, have an announcement, probably a news conference," the President added.

So what are reciprocal tariffs?

Trump last year in his campaign manifesto Agenda47 unveiled the concept under his proposed "Trump Reciprocal Trade Act."

"If India, China, or any other country hits us with a 100 or 200 percent tariff on American-made goods, we will hit them with the same exact tariff. In other words, 100 percent is 100 percent. If they charge US, we charge THEM—an eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff, same exact amount,” Trump had explained.

In Friday's [conference](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1887943727668154549 "conference") with Ishiba, Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs were "the only fair way to do it."

"That way nobody's hurt. They charge us, we charge them. It's the same thing, and I seem to be going in that line, as opposed to a flat fee tariff," the President added.

Trump on February 1 [imposed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401557-white-house-says-trump-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-begin-saturday "imposed") 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing the two North American nations of illegal immigration and sending fentanyl into the U.S. Both countries responded with a willingness to work with Trump, leading to a [delay](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402333-us-will-delay-canada-tariffs-as-countries-work-on-beefing-up-border-security "delay") in the tariffs.

Trump also approved a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. The world's second-largest economy, in stark contrast to Canada and Mexico, [responded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402411-tit-for-tat-china-hits-back-with-tariffs-on-u_s_-coal-lng-vehicles "responded") with its own duties on imports of multiple American products, including LNG, coal and more.
