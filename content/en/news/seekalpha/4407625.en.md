HubSpot (NYSE:[HUBS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS "HubSpot, Inc.")) was in focus on Thursday as KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the marketing software firm after it [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407256-hubspot-q4-revenue-climbs-21-percent-but-q1-outlook-falls-shy-of-expectations "reported") stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guidance.

Shares rose 4.3% in premarket trading.

“We have come full circle on HubSpot,” KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader wrote in a note to clients. “After launching with an Underweight rating a year ago over near-term execution concerns related to changes the Company made to its pricing and packaging, we are now upgrading to Overweight and introducing a $920 price target as those potential headwinds are firmly behind us and the tailwinds from those changes lie ahead. Waiting for a pullback has been a fool's game.”

And even though HubSpot's guidance was somewhat softer-than-expected, that was not enough to dent shares and the set-up for the rest of the year looks “really favorable,” Ader added.

“This is a premier [small and mid]-cap growth asset in a market that continues to favor [small and mid]-cap growth,” he explained. “With risks fading, we may be waiting a long while before getting the pullback we were hoping for, and the opportunity costs of not being involved are too high.”

In addition to KeyBanc's upgrade, several other investment firms raised their price targets on HubSpot, including Canaccord, Raymond James and Needham.
