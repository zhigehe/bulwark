* Specialty fleet investments were prioritized to support mega projects, enabling enhanced cross-selling opportunities and increased share of wallet from existing customers.

* COO Aaron Birnbaum emphasized that the company achieved new Q4 records for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, attributing the performance to specialty fleet growth and strategic execution.

### Outlook

* Herc Holdings projects rental revenue growth of 4-6% for 2025, underpinned by contributions from acquisitions, greenfield expansions, and mega project ramp-ups. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion.
* The company plans gross fleet CapEx of $700 million to $900 million in 2025, with increased focus on specialty equipment to support evolving customer demands.

* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 increased by 14.7% year-over-year to $438 million, supported by disciplined cost management and fleet efficiency improvements.
* Full-year rental revenue rose by over 11%, with adjusted EBITDA margins improving due to national account growth, specialty fleet contributions, and higher proceeds from used equipment sales.
