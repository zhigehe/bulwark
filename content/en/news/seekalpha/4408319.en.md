### Management View

* Knowles reported Q4 revenue of $143 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.27, both within the guided range. The CEO highlighted that challenges in specialty film capacitor production caused a $3 million shortfall in shipments but emphasized confidence in resolving these issues by mid-2025.
* For the full year 2024, revenue grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS increased 32%, driven by MedTech and Specialty Audio growth and the Cornell acquisition. The company views its new $75 million order in the energy sector as a significant driver for future growth, with at least $25 million set to ship in 2026.

* CFO John Anderson stated, "We reported fourth quarter revenues of $143 million, up 2% from the year ago period, and EPS was $0.27, up $0.05 or 23% from Q4 of 2023." He noted that gross margins in Q4 were impacted by product mix and production inefficiencies but are expected to improve as production stabilizes.

### Outlook

* Q1 2025 revenue is projected between $124 million and $134 million, with EPS guidance ranging from $0.16 to $0.20. The company anticipates sequential improvements in specialty film capacitor production, with full resolution expected by the end of H1 2025.

* MedTech and Specialty Audio contributed $70 million in Q4 revenue, flat year-over-year, while Precision Devices generated $73 million, up 4% year-over-year.

### Q&A
