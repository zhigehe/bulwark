UPM-Kymmene Oyj ([OTCPK:UPMKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPMKF "UPM-Kymmene Oyj")) has underperformed in terms of stock price since [our last coverage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699730-upm-kymmene-stock-investments-energy-pulp-online-biorefinery-coming-upgrade-buy). The weak price action means that the valuation appeal has been maintained relative to SCA ([OTCPK:SCABY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCABY "Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ)")), so we continue to be quite bullish on UPM as a pulp and paper pick, even though it's not the most relatively cheap when taking broad sector averages. Our thinking is that firstly there is quite a lot of incremental capacity coming in from Uruguay even though the production has been ramping already throughout 2024. Competitors have also been adding capacity, so prices have suffered, but we see some constructive dynamics coming in, at least in some sales data to China. The other thing we think might constitute an interesting trading angle is that the winter seems to be colder in Finland this year compared to the mild previous winter, which should help contribution from the energy business.

Highlights Segments (Q4 Pres)





[Energy is top 3](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/872/106872/original.pdf) in terms of segments by EBITDA contribution, after fibres and communication papers. Our insight here is that we're actually getting a cold winter ([Finland](https://www.statista.com/statistics/743043/monthly-average-temperatures-in-finland/)), something we've missed for a couple of years in Europe. This means that electricity prices should and are, in fact, coming up. [Prices have almost doubled YoY from weak levels](https://thingler.io/country/Finland).

Sensitivities (Q4 PR)





UPM provides us with some [sensitivity figures](https://www.upm.com/siteassets/asset/investors/2024/upm-financial-statements-release-2024-en.pdf). The price has increased by around 4 EUR/MWh, so a positive 15 million EUR EBIT effect plus volume effects can be expected on a go forward basis YoY for the coming Q1 figures. The increases seen over the year are already being reflected in the EBIT pickup in the energy segment. [Volumes in energy were up 10% YoY](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755140-upm-kymmene-oyj-upmkf-q4-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript).

In fibres, prices were down somewhat. A lot of capacity is coming online this year. Suzano ([SUZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SUZ "Suzano S.A.")) made a major capacity addition, and UPM's own Uruguay plant reached full utilisation this quarter with the completion of the associated rail infrastructure. Our estimate is that overall capacity grew around 7% or more this year. 11% declines in pulp were seen sequentially, but the new volumes meant a 22% sequential delivery increase. That's around a 70 EUR per tonne decrease, which means around a 200 million EUR sequential hit based on sensitivities. We saw that in the charts above, offset by the higher sequential deliveries. Incremental benefits for the coming FY is going to be a little under 10% with most of the new Uruguay launch captured by the FY 2024. Since UPM sources some timbre from other sources, the structurally high timbre prices, due in part to the lack of Russian timbre supply nowadays, have also been a bit of a pressure even on the mostly vertically integrated business. The pulp outlook isn't too bad though, with some sales markets reporting successful pushes of price increases, signaling that things might be [bottoming out](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/sellers-push-through-pulp-price-hikes/).

While UPM is vertically integrated completely in terms of pulp inputs for its paper businesses, there are still revenue recognition and delay effects that meant lower pulp prices haven't fully benefited the downstream segments yet. Both the specialty papers and the more important communications paper businesses have latent benefits from the falling pulp prices that aren't present in results yet.

Comm papers are in at least a transitional decline. While return on capital employed in the business is apparently above 20%, significant capacity has been retired in order to open 45 million EUR in annual savings. Some variable cost declines came in on account of pulp prices falling this year. Deliveries declined on account of the plant closures in the second half of 2024. Deliveries are expected to continue to decrease in the H1 2025.

Bottom Line
-----------

In our previous coverage, we expected the biorefinery project to stop being a drag on results sooner than the reality, which is that operation won't start until 2027 and therefore around 100 million of EUR are going to keep coming out of the bottom line. The Leuna project is even going into an overrun and has copped an impairment above 300 million EUR. This is out of an estimate of 1.275 billion EUR for the total project.

Biorefining Contribution (Q4 Pres)





The Raflatac is also getting expanded through more M&A into the graphics paper world. This is a cyclical and macro economically levered market as well. While the latest Metamark acquisition is supposed to be EBITDA accretive, we aren't sure how interested we are in UPM sinking cash into a brand solutions business.

On the other hand, there is a solid industrial backdrop. We think pulp markets will absorb the new capacity, and are seeing encouraging signs of export prices to China rising. We think that Energy is going to be solid in Q1 with a cold winter in Finland. UPM are continuing to build on Raflatac. Comm papers is still a concern, and we aren't crazy with the sinking of cash into biorefineries either. But there's at least the value case. It is still a lot cheaper than SCA and [other picks that we like less like Holmen](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4749564-holmen-ab-buybacks-may-be-a-little-too-early) ([OTCPK:HLMMF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLMMF "Holmen AB (publ)")) which has some riskier end markets. Relative to world averages, it's more in line, and honestly, it's a bit of a premium [compared to European comps](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UPM-KYMMENE-OYJ-1412565/sector-valuation/), though it's a quality pick in terms of vertical integration, and it has favourable other exposures that are in more constructive end market environments right now like Energy. The dividend is also solid at over 5%, and we think the languished price, even if slightly recovered from local lows by around 6%, offers something to investors looking to index towards pulp and paper.
