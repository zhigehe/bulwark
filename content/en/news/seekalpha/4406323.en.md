ArcelorMittal (NYSE:[MT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MT "ArcelorMittal S.A.")) said it is considering the possibility of [moving some business support activities to India from Europe](https://www.wsj.com/business/arcelormittal-considers-moving-support-activities-to-india-to-cut-costs-54f2f89d "moving some business support activities to India from Europe") to cut costs in the face of a challenging backdrop for the European steel industry, *The Wall Street Journal* reported Tuesday.

The steelmaker said it discussed the proposal at a meeting with its European works council, as part of its efforts to address major issues that the company said threaten the future of steelmaking in Europe.

The move comes after ArcelorMittal (NYSE:[MT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MT "ArcelorMittal S.A.")) said as recently as Monday that urgent support was needed to bolster the competitiveness and sustainability of European steelmaking and to protect the industry from what the company says are unfair trade practices.

The company said the industry is contending with significant excess global capacity, subdued demand in Europe and record-high imports.
