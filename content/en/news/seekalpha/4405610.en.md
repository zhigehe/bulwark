* L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:[LHX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LHX "L3Harris Technologies, Inc.")) has introduced AMORPHOUS™, its new software that features a single user interface to operate thousands of [autonomous assets](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996758-l3harris-launches-new-technology-to-control-autonomous-swarms) simultaneously.
* Designed with an open architecture, this software enables the United States and allied militaries to control a mix of uncrewed platforms, payloads and systems, even if another manufacturer produces them.
* This collaborative autonomy at scale will provide warfighters with a decisive overmatch capability.
* “Autonomy is a force multiplier, which is why we have designed AMORPHOUS as a multi-domain, multi-mission capability that rapidly integrates a variety of uncrewed systems across the battlespace,” said Jon Rambeau, President, Integrated Mission Systems, L3Harris.
* AMORPHOUS supports decentralized decision-making, which enables individual uncrewed assets to perform their own tasks autonomously and make real-time tactical decisions inside the network.
