Norsk Hydro ([OTCQX:NHYDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NHYDY "Norsk Hydro ASA ADR")) -0.9% in European trading Monday following President Trump's plans to introduce 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum on all countries exporting the metals to the U.S.

Norsk Hydro ([OTCQX:NHYDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NHYDY "Norsk Hydro ASA ADR")) has more than 20 sites in the U.S., as well as plants in Canada and Mexico that could be affected by U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a spokesman for the company told Dow Jones.

While the company allocates most of its annual Norwegian aluminum production to the European market, it has nearly 6,000 employees in the U.S.

Norsk Hydro ([OTCQX:NHYDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NHYDY "Norsk Hydro ASA ADR")) said it is preparing for different scenarios but that it is still too early to say how tariffs would affect its operations in the long term.
