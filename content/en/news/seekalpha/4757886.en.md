Nuthawut Somsuk





We're back again with another round of dividend increases. This week is particularly special because we have three dividend kings on the list. One of them, Archer-Daniels-Midland ([ADM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADM "Archer-Daniels-Midland Company")), is a newly minted king with a remarkable 50-year dividend streak! Consolidated Edison and the Black Hills Corporation are the other two kings, boasting streaks of 51 and 55 years, respectively. Not to be overshadowed, I have five more companies offering dividend increases of over 10%. The full group displays an average increase of 6.3% and a median increase of 4.7%.

Companies that consistently grow their dividends are often seen as better investments over time, as this reflects financial health and stability. Regular dividend increases indicate that a company is generating strong cash flow, leading to long-term wealth accumulation for investors. This reliability attracts more investors and often drives stock prices higher over time, significantly benefiting shareholders.

My investment strategy centers on purchasing, maintaining, and expanding positions in companies that meet two key criteria: consistently rising dividends and outperforming a comparable benchmark. I compiled this information as part of my investment strategy and am excited to share my results with my Seeking Alpha audience. This list aims to assist you in making informed investment decisions and building a prosperous long-term portfolio.

How I Created The Lists
-----------------------

The information presented here results from integrating two data sources: the "U.S. Dividend Champions" spreadsheet from a specific website and upcoming dividend data from NASDAQ. This integration merges data on companies with a track record of consistent dividend growth with their anticipated future dividend payments. It's crucial to note that every company on this list has maintained a record of dividend growth for at least five years.

A company must offer higher total annual dividends to be considered for this list. As a result, a company might not increase its dividend every calendar year, but its overall annual dividend can still grow.

### What Is The Ex-Dividend Date?

The ex-dividend date is when you must own shares to qualify for an upcoming dividend or distribution. To be eligible, you must have bought the shares by the end of the preceding business day. For instance, if the ex-dividend date is Tuesday, you must have acquired the shares by the market close on Monday. If the ex-dividend date falls on a Monday (or a Tuesday following a holiday on Monday), you must have purchased the shares by the previous Friday.

### Dividend Streak Categories

Here are the definitions of the streak categories, as I'll use them throughout the piece.

* King: 50+ years
* Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years
* Contender: 10-24 years
* Challenger: 5+ years

   | **Category** | **Count** |
| King | 3 |
| Champion | 1 |
| Contender | 6 |
| Challenger | 7 |

### Tickers By Yield And Growth Rates

I've organized the table in descending order, allowing investors to prioritize the current yield. Additionally, the table includes some historical dividend growth rates. I've also incorporated the "Chowder Rule," the sum of the current yield and the five-year dividend growth rate.

| Ticker | Yield | 1 Yr DG | 3 Yr DG | 5 Yr DG | 10 Yr DG | Chowder Rule |
| UPS | 5.75 | 0.6 | 16.9 | 11.2 | 9.3 | 17 |

### Historical Returns

My investment strategy focuses on identifying stocks that consistently outperform the market while also increasing their dividend payouts. I rely on two primary ETF benchmarks. If a stock does not outperform its relevant benchmark, I prefer to invest in an ETF instead.

I recommend the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ([SCHD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD "Schwab Strategic Trust - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF")) for broad access to U.S. equity markets, excluding the REIT sector. SCHD boasts a solid track record of strong performance, offers a higher yield than the S&P 500, and consistently raises dividends.

The ten-year dividend growth rate is significant and essential to the total return performance among the four key factors influencing the SCHD index. Share prices generally align with substantial dividend growth over extended periods, and long-term trends often outweigh short-term fluctuations. Consequently, I will exclude companies that lack a ten-year dividend growth rate from the upcoming comparison.

I prefer the Cohen & Steers REIT & Preferred Income Fund ([RNP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNP "Cohen & Steers REIT and Preferred and Income Fund")) for REITs. It's a leveraged fund that combines common and preferred shares of REITs. The fund has an extensive track record since its launch in 2003 and has historically outperformed rivals such as the Vanguard Real Estate Index ETF ([VNQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ "Vanguard Real Estate ETF")).

Based on this analysis (and further due diligence), I've added many companies to my portfolio and will make timely purchases of existing holdings. The chart will show the total return levels, assuming that dividends are reinvested.

I compare SCHD to the companies on this list with a 10-year dividend growth rate. Since there are so many companies, I will split the data across multiple charts. The competitors are listed in order of their growth rates, starting with the highest. I generally expect the companies with the highest long-term growth rates to be our outperformers.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_d7aa6316232cf2b72666f7d54cd2b1e4.png)

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)



Several stocks outperformed in the first group. SCHD, represented by the purple line, provided investors with a passive total return of 188% over the decade. Almost all of the competitors did well, with the exception of OGS and, to a lesser extent, MKTX. Interestingly enough, MKTX was an enormous winner during the post-COVID market surge. In fact, it is significantly below the peaks seen during 2021.

WWD, XYL, AFL, and MAS were all great performers, all of whom beat SCHD. In fact, only 7% separates first-place WWD from third-place AFL.

Let's take a look at the second group now.

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)



In this group, the only outperformed was YUM. In my mind, depending on where an investor is in their cycle, companies that offer small increases year after year tend to lag a broad dividend-growth-based index.

All three of our dividend kings fit into this group. Arguably, the best time to buy these kings would have been decades ago. What I'm trying to achieve is buying the dividend kings of tomorrow today.

Next Steps
----------

I maintain high standards for the individual stocks in my portfolio. It's not merely about slightly surpassing a benchmark; I seek out companies with a strong history of outstanding performance. I aim to thoroughly analyze their historical data to evaluate the chances of that success persisting.

In truth, I have no intention of looking closer at any of these. The individual dividend-growth stocks in my portfolio have had much better historical performances than anyone in this group. Years ago, I owned AFL, so that would have been a wise pick to hold on to.

Let me know what you think of my strategy, and feel free to add yours in the comments below! As always, please do your due diligence before making any investment decision.
