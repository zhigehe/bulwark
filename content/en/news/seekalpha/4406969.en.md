Synopsys's ([SNPS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNPS "Synopsys, Inc.")) planned purchase of Ansys (NASDAQ:[ANSS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANSS "ANSYS, Inc.")) is seeing some serious concerns from Chinese third parties.

China's antitrust regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, is said to have flagged the issues to the deal parties, according to a Dealreporter item on Wednesday, which cited people familiar with the matter. 

The concern of the third parties may result in the Chinese antitrust regulator requiring that any mitigation talks require the evaluation of structural remedies for the $35 billion deal, according to the report. The companies have so far been reluctant to offer any remedies as part of their talks with SAMR.
