Investment environment
----------------------

* During the quarter, the portfolio’s primary benchmark, the MSCI World Index, was flat in U.S. dollar terms. Meanwhile, the portfolio’s secondary benchmark, the 85% MSCI ACWI ex USA High Dividend Yield/15% MSCI USA High Dividend Yield Index, fell by 6.9%. The portfolio underperformed the primary benchmark and outperformed the secondary benchmark.

* Equity market returns around the world were driven by events in the United States during 2024’s final quarter. Trump and the Republican Party won the presidential election after a campaign promising to “Make America Great Again.” This outcome resulted in a combination of optimism for U.S. equities on the premise that the new administration would be more proactive about promoting economic growth, and concerns that his policies might negatively impact other countries’ growth due to trade tariffs and foreign policy changes.
* Additionally, economic growth for the U.S. was stronger than expected and investors began to expect fewer interest rate cuts and potentially higher inflation in coming years. Due to these events, the U.S. dollar strengthened, interest rate expectations increased, and the U.S. equity market outperformed the rest of the world despite the higher overall valuation of the market.
* Higher bond yields proved to be a headwind for defensive sectors, such as real estate, consumer staples, and utilities, but positive for the banking sector, which outperformed. Cyclical sectors, notably consumer discretionary and information technology, performed well over the period, and the Magnificent Seven stocks (the dominant tech companies Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")), Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc."))([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")), Meta ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), and Tesla (TSLA)) continued their strength, driven by optimism about artificial intelligence (AI). Growth stocks notably outperformed value and dividend stocks.

Portfolio review
----------------

Lower rate-cut expectations and excitement around U.S. growth meant that defensive and interest rate-sensitive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, telecoms, utilities, real estate, and consumer staples, underperformed the broader market. As a result, the portfolio’s overweight exposure to consumer staples and utilities detracted from relative performance. By contrast, stock selection in healthcare contributed, as did the underweight exposure to industrials, as the sector fell due to concerns over risks of high U.S. trade tariffs and their impact on growth.

On a regional basis, the U.S. significantly outperformed international markets, driven by the outperformance of a concentrated list of growth companies. As such, the portfolio’s underweight exposure to the U.S. and overweight exposure to international markets were detrimental to relative returns. Political instability and unfavorable policies impacted performance within the French and South Korean markets over the period, while international markets were more generally affected by concerns over tariff risks impacting economic growth. The portfolio’s holdings in UK financials were positive for relative returns over the period despite concerns around the new UK government’s budget that was announced in late November.

Manager outlook
---------------

Now that inflation appears to be under control, centrals banks have proceeded to cut interest rates in many countries around the world, and some governments are looking at ways to stimulate growth. These factors should be positive for companies and consumers as we head into 2025.

However, we remain cognizant of the geopolitical backdrop and recognize that the new U.S. government brings some uncertainty, which could result in market volatility and highlights the importance of maintaining a diversified portfolio to reduce exposure to policy changes.

We are confident that the companies held in the portfolio are well positioned to benefit from long-term structural trends and successfully navigate the current conditions.

For equity portfolios, relative contribution compares the performance of a security in the portfolio to the benchmark’s total return, factoring in the difference in weight of that security in the benchmark. Returns are calculated using daily returns and previous day ending weights rolled up by ticker, gross of advisory fees, may exclude certain derivatives and does not represent actual performance.  **There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.**  **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Foreign securities** are subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  **Dividend-Oriented Stocks Risk**, Issuers that have paid regular dividends to shareholders may decrease or eliminate dividend payments in the future. A decrease in dividend payments by an issuer may result in a decrease in the value of the security.  **Value** **stocks** can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time and may not appreciate to the extent expected.  **Environmental, Social, and** **Governance (“ESG”)** factors are integrated into the investment process by focusing on those ESG factors considered most likely to have a material impact on the financial performance of the issuers. ESG factors are one of many considerations in the investment decision-making process and may not be determinative in deciding to include or exclude an investment.  **Increased** **portfolio** **turnover** may result in higher expenses and potentially higher net taxable gains or losses.  **MSCI** **World** **Index****℠** reflects the equity market performance of global developed markets.  **85% MSCI ACWI ex-US High Div Yld / 15% MSCI USA High Div Yld Index** is an internally-calculated, hypothetical combination of total returns from the MSCI All Country World ex-USA High Dividend Yield Index (85%) and the MSCI USA High Dividend Yield Index (15%). The underlying indices reflect the performance of higher dividend yield large and mid-cap equities from (i) global developed and emerging markets excluding the U.S. and (ii) the U.S. markets.
