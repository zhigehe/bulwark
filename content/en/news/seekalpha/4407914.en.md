Earnings Call Insights: Avient Corporation (NYSE:[AVNT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVNT "Avient Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ashish Khandpur highlighted the company's new strategic direction aimed at organic growth and margin expansion. He emphasized that 2024 marked a pivotal year with the successful launch of a new strategy targeting high-growth markets and secular trends, resulting in organic revenue growth across all regions. Key achievements included a 4% increase in organic sales for the full year and margin expansion for both business segments.
* Dr. Khandpur announced the launch of Dyneema HB330 and HB332, third-generation products offering advanced ballistic protection for military and law enforcement applications. This innovation is expected to strengthen the company's competitive position in defense and law enforcement markets.
* CFO Jamie Beggs noted that overall Q4 earnings aligned with guidance, with a 5% year-over-year organic sales increase. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS were down slightly due to variable compensation accruals and FX headwinds.
* Management announced the decision to halt the implementation of the S/4HANA ERP system, citing increased costs and risks. This decision will result in a $71M impairment charge and a $15M charge for license fees in Q1 2025. Alternative solutions are being explored to achieve similar benefits at lower costs.

### Outlook

* 2025 guidance includes a projected adjusted EPS range of $2.70 to $2.94, representing 11% growth at the midpoint, excluding FX impacts. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted between $540M and $570M.
* Q1 2025 adjusted EPS is expected at $0.76, including a $0.04 FX headwind. Management highlighted a challenging comparison due to outsized defense orders in Q1 2024.
* Management emphasized the importance of innovation and market share gains to counter macroeconomic uncertainties, including FX impacts, interest rate dynamics, and global economic conditions.

### Financial Results

* Specialty Engineered Materials ([SEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEM "Select Medical Holdings Corporation")) posted 8% organic sales growth in Q4, driven by demand in healthcare, defense, and building and construction applications. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment grew 13%, aided by favorable pricing and mix.
* Color, Additives, and Inks (CAI) achieved 3% organic sales growth in Q4, supported by strong demand in drug delivery, consumer products, and building materials. EBITDA margins expanded despite flat raw material costs.
* Full-year adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year to $2.66, supported by a 6% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $526M. Both business segments contributed to the solid performance, with the SEM segment achieving 6% organic sales growth for the year.
* FX headwinds negatively affected Q4 EBITDA by $2M and EPS by $0.01, reflecting the company's significant international exposure (60% of revenues from outside the U.S.).

### Q&A

* Frank Mitsch, Fermium Research: Asked about the impact of the new Dyneema product on defense sales and expectations for 2025. CEO Khandpur highlighted the innovation's relevance to military and law enforcement applications, emphasizing its potential to drive margin expansion and competitive differentiation. He noted that defense sales are expected to grow mid-single digits in 2025 despite tough Q1 comps.
* Mike Harrison, Seaport Research: Inquired about the decision to halt the S/4HANA ERP project. Dr. Khandpur explained that increased costs and risks made the project untenable. Instead, the company will adopt alternative solutions leveraging advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to achieve similar benefits more efficiently.
* Kristen Owen, Oppenheimer: Asked about the alignment of Avient's new incentive structure with its growth strategy. Dr. Khandpur explained that the revised plan rewards business-specific performance metrics, such as sales growth or cash generation, to drive desired behaviors and align with strategic priorities.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the company's strategic initiatives and innovation pipeline. Specific concerns were raised about macroeconomic factors, ERP implementation costs, and defense sales volatility.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks but was measured when addressing headwinds and uncertainties during Q&A. Dr. Khandpur underscored the company's commitment to innovation and market share gains, while CFO Beggs provided detailed explanations of financial impacts.
* Compared to Q3, the tone during Q4 was more focused on addressing challenges, particularly related to FX and ERP costs, while maintaining optimism about future growth.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 reflects increased transparency and a focus on mitigating macroeconomic uncertainties, compared to Q3's narrower range for full-year projections.
* Strategic emphasis on innovation, such as the Dyneema product line, highlights a shift toward high-growth, high-margin markets, building on Q3's introduction of new business priorities.
* Analysts' focus shifted from restocking trends and regional growth in Q3 to macroeconomic risks and the ERP project's impact in Q4.
* Management tone remained consistent, emphasizing execution and growth, though Q4 featured more detailed discussions on mitigating external risks.

### Risks and Concerns

* Macro-level risks, including FX volatility, interest rate uncertainty, and global economic dynamics, were highlighted by management as key challenges for 2025.
* The decision to halt the S/4HANA ERP project introduces a one-time financial impact of $86M, though management is exploring alternative solutions to mitigate this.
* Analysts raised concerns about defense sales volatility and potential impacts of geopolitical developments, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and NATO spending changes.

### Final Takeaway

Avient Corporation closed 2024 with strong organic growth and margin expansion, supported by innovative product launches and strategic priorities. Looking ahead, the company projects EPS growth in 2025, driven by market share gains and innovation, despite macroeconomic uncertainties and one-time charges related to the ERP project.
