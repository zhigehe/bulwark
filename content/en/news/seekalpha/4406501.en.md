Google (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc."))(NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) have renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on their popular map apps.

The change comes following an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump on January 20, his first day in office. This was followed by his proclamation that February 9 is now Gulf of America Day.

"I took this action in part because, as stated in that Order, '[t]he area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America,'" the [proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/gulf-of-america-day-2025/ "proclamation") said.

"People using Maps in the U.S. will see 'Gulf of America,' and people in Mexico will see 'Gulf of Mexico,'" Google said in a [blog](https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/ "blog") post. "Everyone else will see both names."

Meanwhile, Apple Maps is expected to switch to using Gulf of America for U.S. users as soon as today, and it will be rolled out to global users soon.
