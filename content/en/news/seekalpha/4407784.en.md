Earnings Call Insights: Commerzbank AG ([OTCPK:CRZBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRZBF "Commerzbank AG")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Bettina Orlopp described 2024 as "an extremely successful year" with a net return on tangible equity of 9.2%, exceeding the 8% target. Capital return totaled €1.7 billion, surpassing plans, and the CET1 ratio reached 15.1%, providing a robust buffer for future growth.
* The bank achieved a cost/income ratio of 59%, better than the 60% target, supported by strong revenue growth of 6.2% and controlled costs of €6.5 billion.
* A share buyback program of €600 million was completed, with an additional tranche of up to €400 million approved. A dividend of €0.65 per share is proposed.
* CFO Carsten Schmitt highlighted Q4 as one of the bank's best quarters with double-digit RoTE, record revenues, and stable net interest income (NII) of €8.3 billion for 2024 despite lower rates and higher deposit betas.

### Outlook

* NII guidance for 2025 is set between €7.7 billion and €7.9 billion, with a connected fair value contribution of €0.4 billion to €0.3 billion, resulting in a combined range of €8.1 billion to €8.2 billion.
* Management targets a cost/income ratio of 57% in 2025 and anticipates a net result of €2.4 billion, or €2.8 billion excluding restructuring charges. A payout ratio of 100%, excluding certain one-off charges, is planned.
* A CET1 ratio of at least 14% is expected, supported by a 4% RWA increase from business growth and economic factors.
* Risk provisions for 2025 are forecast at €850 million, reflecting a muted German economic outlook.

### Financial Results

* Net commission income rose 7% year-on-year, driven by securities and asset management activities. Corporate Clients saw a 5% revenue increase, propelled by fee, lending, and rates businesses, while private and small business customers achieved similar growth through higher fee income and deposit volumes.
* The mBank subsidiary in Poland reported 10% growth in both NII and net commission income, demonstrating robust margin management and volume increases.
* Operating expenses excluding mBank rose 2%, while mBank costs increased 14% due to growth investments and FX effects. Group cost/income ratio for 2024 was 59%.
* Risk provisions for Q4 were €214 million, bringing the full-year total to €743 million. The CET1 ratio grew to 15.1% by year-end.
* Share buybacks and dividend distributions exceeded the €3 billion capital return target, reaching €3.1 billion for 2022-2024.

### Q&A

* Jeremy Sigee, BNP Paribas, sought clarification on the above-100% payout for 2025 and regulatory approval. CEO Orlopp confirmed ECB acknowledgment of restructuring costs under the payout framework and noted wage inflation expectations of 4-5% for 2025.
* Borja Ramirez, Citi, inquired about declining deposit beta and structural hedge details. CFO Schmitt explained that maturing higher rate deposits contributed to beta reduction and confirmed €138 billion in deposits for the structural hedge.
* Johannes Thormann, HSBC, questioned risk result granularity and mortgage growth. Orlopp cited no systematic default patterns but noted larger single defaults in Corporate Clients. Mortgage growth recovery was linked to favorable interest rate trends.
* Benjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank, asked about fee income dynamics and share buyback approvals. Orlopp attributed fee growth to securities, asset management, and payments initiatives, including Aquila Capital and Visa partnerships.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts displayed a neutral to slightly positive tone, pressing for clarity on NII sensitivity, capital distribution, and growth strategies. Questions were detailed but not overly critical.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing flexibility in cost management and capital distribution. CEO Orlopp reiterated commitment to delivering strong shareholder returns, saying, "We are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges ahead."
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was consistently optimistic, while analysts maintained a similar level of scrutiny.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Management raised 2025 NII guidance slightly from Q3, while reaffirming cost/income ratio and CET1 targets. Fee income momentum improved, supported by multiple business initiatives.
* Analysts' focus shifted from near-term NII fluctuations to long-term growth drivers and capital efficiency measures.
* Strategic clarity on cost flexibility and loan growth was introduced, with management noting readiness to adjust costs if revenue targets are at risk.

### Risks and Concerns

* Challenges include economic uncertainty in Germany, deposit beta sensitivity, and regulatory factors affecting capital returns.
* Management highlighted adaptability, noting flexibility to adjust costs, including marketing and staffing, if revenue growth falters.
* FX mortgage provisions in Poland remain a concern, though management expects material declines in 2025.

### Final Takeaway

Commerzbank's robust 2024 performance sets a strong foundation for 2025, with targets for €8.1 billion to €8.2 billion in combined NII and fair value, supported by cost controls and strategic investments. Capital returns remain a priority, with flexibility to navigate macroeconomic and regulatory challenges. The bank's commitment to shareholder value is reinforced through proactive fee growth and risk management strategies, while its strong CET1 ratio provides resilience for future growth.
