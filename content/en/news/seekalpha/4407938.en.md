### Management View

* CEO Jerry Gahlhoff emphasized that fiscal 2024 was a strong year with $3.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a 10.3% increase year-over-year. Organic growth reached 7.9%, supported by investments in staffing and operational strategies. A dedicated commercial division within Orkin contributed to a 15% increase in the commercial sales force.
* The company closed 44 tuck-in acquisitions in 2024, maintaining a robust M&A pipeline. Gahlhoff noted, "We remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience and investing meaningfully in our team to drive growth."
* CFO Kenneth Krause highlighted operating cash flow of $608 million and free cash flow of $580 million, reflecting 15% and 17% year-over-year increases, respectively. "We delivered robust revenue growth of 10.4% in Q4, with organic growth at 8.5%, the highest quarterly organic growth of the year," Krause stated.
* Krause also noted Fitch and S&P's assignment of investment-grade credit ratings, which will provide enhanced access to capital markets.

### Outlook

* The company expects 2025 organic growth in the range of 7%-8%, complemented by at least 2%-3% growth from M&A.
* Krause stated that pricing levels in 2025 are expected to remain above CPI, continuing the trend of 3%-4% pricing increases seen in recent years. "We feel pretty good about our position with pricing in the marketplace," he added.
* Incremental margins are anticipated to improve in 2025, with Krause projecting cash flow conversion to exceed 100% again for the year.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter revenue increased 10.4%, with organic growth of 8.5%. Residential revenue rose 8.4%, commercial pest control revenue grew 9.2%, and termite and ancillary services surged 16.6%.
* Adjusted net income for Q4 was $109 million, translating to $0.23 per share, representing a nearly 10% increase year-over-year.
* Gross margin for Q4 improved by 40 basis points to 51.3%, driven by efficiencies in materials and supplies and people costs, despite insurance and claims headwinds.
* Quarterly SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue rose by 50 basis points, attributed to increased sales and marketing investments.

### Q&A

* Tim Mulrooney, William Blair: Questioned the drivers behind the 6.5% residential organic growth in Q4. CEO Gahlhoff attributed the growth to increased demand, particularly for rodent-related services, and noted strong lead generation and call volume.
* George Tong, Goldman Sachs: Asked about the impact of auto claims on Q4 EBITDA margins. Krause detailed that auto claims reduced margins by approximately 40 basis points, citing legacy claims as the primary driver.
* Ashish Sabadra, RBC Capital: Inquired about pricing in 2025. Krause confirmed the company plans to continue pricing at levels slightly above CPI, supported by the value of their services.
* Jason Haas, Wells Fargo: Asked about incremental margins. Krause mentioned that the underlying business demonstrates capability for 30% to 40% incremental margins, despite temporary headwinds in Q4.

* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts were more focused on pricing dynamics and operational challenges, while management maintained a consistent tone of optimism.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Organic growth improved from 7.7% in Q3 to 8.5% in Q4, driven by stronger residential and termite service performance.
* Incremental margins faced pressure in Q4 due to higher insurance claims and growth-related investments, contrasting with Q3's more stable margin profile.
* Management's tone remained optimistic in both quarters, but Q4 highlighted progress in credit ratings and M&A pipeline strength.
* Analysts in Q4 focused more on pricing strategies and recurring revenue growth compared to Q3's focus on residential market dynamics.

### Risks and Concerns

* Legacy auto claims continue to pressure margins, with management implementing safety measures to mitigate future claims.
* Elevated investments in sales and marketing were questioned as potential cost inefficiencies, though management emphasized long-term benefits.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential seasonal impacts on pest populations and their effect on growth.

### Final Takeaway

Rollins, Inc. delivered strong Q4 performance, with the highest organic growth rate of 2024 and strategic investments driving long-term growth.
