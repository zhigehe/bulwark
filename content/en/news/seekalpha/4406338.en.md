### Outlook

* Cincinnati Financial estimated Q1 2025 catastrophe losses from California wildfires at $450 million to $525 million, net of reinsurance recoveries. Approximately 73% of these losses are from personal lines, 24% from Cincinnati Re, and 3% from Cincinnati Global.
* The company anticipates a net decrease in premium revenue of $50 million to $60 million in Q1 2025 due to additional reinsurance premiums.
* Management renewed its primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaties for 2025, adding $300 million of coverage and increasing the top of the program to $1.5 billion.

### Financial Results

* Property casualty net written premiums grew 17% for Q4, driven by 15% growth in agency renewal premiums and 23% growth in new business premiums.
* Investment portfolio valuation faced challenges in Q4, with a $136 million loss in the equity portfolio and a $350 million loss in the bond portfolio. The total investment portfolio remains in a net appreciated value of $6.7 billion.

* Share repurchases in 2024 totaled 1.1 million shares at an average price of $113 per share.

### Q&A

* Michael Phillips, Oppenheimer: Asked about reinsurance sector capacity post-California wildfires and its impact on Cincinnati Re. CEO Steve Spray responded that Cincinnati Re's losses were within expectations and that the company plans no changes to its 2025 strategy.
* Gregory Peters, Raymond James: Inquired about wildfire loss gross estimates and market rate environment in California. CEO Spray declined to provide gross loss figures but mentioned ongoing evaluations of lessons learned and potential strategic adjustments.
* Unidentified Analyst, KBW: Questioned reserve strengthening in commercial auto and excess and surplus lines. CFO Sewell explained that reserve strengthening was driven by case-incurred liability losses for recent accident years in personal auto and casualty trends in E&S lines.
* Grace Carter, Bank of America: Asked about commercial casualty core loss ratio trends. CEO Spray attributed Q3 increases to industry-wide litigation cost pressures and maintained that prospective rates are ahead of loss costs.

* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strong underwriting practices, financial stability, and opportunities for growth despite macro uncertainties.
* Compared to the prior quarter, analysts' focus shifted from general performance metrics to catastrophe losses and reserve adequacy, while management maintained consistent confidence in its pricing and underwriting strategies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 saw a stronger combined ratio improvement compared to Q3, driven by reduced catastrophe losses and robust premium growth.
* Management tone remained consistent, but Q4 discussions included more emphasis on addressing wildfire impacts and reserve adjustments.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about the financial impact of California wildfires, including reinsurance costs and potential changes in catastrophe risk management.

Management remains confident in its pricing, underwriting, and reinsurance strategies, while analysts raised concerns about reserve adequacy and macroeconomic pressures. The company's strong financial position, bolstered by a 7% dividend increase and record-high book value per share, supports its ability to navigate these challenges and capitalize on market opportunities.
