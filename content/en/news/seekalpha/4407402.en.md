Earnings Call Insights: Primerica (NYSE:[PRI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRI "Primerica, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Glenn Williams outlined a strong finish to 2024, with record-breaking results across all key metrics. Adjusted net operating income grew 14% for the year, while adjusted operating income per share increased 20%. The company returned $425 million in share repurchases and $113 million in dividends to stockholders, equating to 79% of adjusted net operating income.
* The salesforce expanded to a record 151,611 representatives by year-end, a 7% increase from 2023. However, growth in the life insurance policies issued was more modest, reflecting cost-of-living pressures.
* The Investment and Savings Products (ISP) segment reported $3.3 billion in sales for Q4, marking a 41% year-over-year increase. This performance was driven by strong demand for variable annuities, mutual funds, and managed accounts. Client asset values ended the year at $112 billion, up 16%, while net client inflows reached $731 million for the quarter.
* CFO Tracy Tan highlighted that Term Life revenues for Q4 reached $451 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by a 6% increase in adjusted direct premiums. The benefits and claims ratio for the quarter was 58.6%, aligning with full-year guidance.

### Outlook

* Management expects life insurance policy growth to slow to approximately 2% in 2025 due to continued cost-of-living challenges.
* The life sales force is projected to expand by roughly 3% in 2025, described as a normalization following a strong 7% growth in 2024.
* ISP sales are forecast to grow in the mid- to high-single-digit range in 2025, supported by robust demand for investment products, favorable equity markets, and enhanced product offerings.
* Term Life ADP growth of around 5% is anticipated in 2025, with the benefits and claims ratio expected to remain stable at approximately 58%, and operating margins near 22%.

### Financial Results

* ISP revenues for the quarter increased 29% to $286 million, while pretax income rose 31% to $82 million. Sales-based revenues surged 42%, reflecting strong client demand for variable annuities and managed accounts.
* Managed account sales grew by 47%, supported by the company’s new platform, which offers enhanced planning tools and a broader range of investment choices.
* The Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment reported a $1 million pretax operating loss, an improvement from a $5.4 million loss in the prior year period. This was attributed to increased investment income and adjustments to ceded reserves.
* Consolidated operating expenses rose 13% year-over-year in Q4, driven by higher employee-related costs, variable expenses tied to growth in ISP and Term Life segments, and increased technology investments.

### Q&A

* Wilma Burdis, Raymond James: Asked about the sustainability of 5% ADP growth and any lingering effects from coinsurance runoff. Tracy Tan confirmed that the guidance incorporates higher lapse trends and the impact of coinsurance runoff, making the 5% growth achievable.
* John Barnidge, Piper Sandler: Inquired about the timeline for cost-of-living pressures to stabilize and their impact on sales. Glenn Williams noted that normalization could take over a year as consumers adjust their spending habits and rebuild financial stability.
* Mark Hughes, Truist Securities: Asked about the demographic tailwinds driving variable annuity sales. Glenn Williams attributed this to an aging client base transitioning to income distribution, supported by attractive product features such as income guarantees.
* Suneet Kamath, Jefferies: Queried about the mix of variable annuity products. Williams confirmed an increasing shift toward index-linked annuities, aligning with broader industry trends.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about cost-of-living pressures and their impact on lapses and life sales growth, reflecting a slightly cautious tone. Questions also probed the company’s ability to sustain ISP growth and capitalize on demographic trends.
* Management maintained a confident and proactive stance, emphasizing the resilience of its business model and the scalability of its ISP segment. Phrases such as “we are confident” and “well positioned” highlighted their optimism despite near-term headwinds.
* Compared to Q3, management’s tone was slightly more conservative, particularly regarding life insurance policy growth and headwinds from elevated lapses. However, confidence in ISP momentum and cash flow stability remained strong.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* ISP sales growth accelerated to 41% in Q4 from 34% in Q3, underpinned by robust demand for variable annuities and managed accounts. Client inflows also significantly increased quarter-over-quarter.
* Life insurance productivity per agent showed slight pressure, with Q4 policies issued up only 1% year-over-year compared to 5% in Q3. Management plans to address this by improving productivity among new agents in 2025.
* Operating expenses continued to rise, consistent with trends reported in Q3, largely due to technology investments and higher incentive compensation.
* Analysts’ focus in Q4 shifted more toward addressing cost-of-living pressures, while the previous quarter had greater emphasis on ISP sales momentum and recruiting gains.

### Risks and Concerns

* Cost-of-living pressures remain a significant headwind, potentially constraining life insurance sales and contributing to elevated lapse rates.
* Persistently high lapse rates in the Term Life segment could impact future ADP growth, although management noted signs of stabilization.
* Economic uncertainty and potential volatility in equity markets may pose risks to ISP and annuity sales growth.
* Rising technology expenses may weigh on near-term margins, though management views these as necessary investments for long-term scalability and efficiency.

### Final Takeaway

Primerica closed 2024 with record-breaking results, driven by strong ISP sales and salesforce growth. However, the company has adopted a more cautious outlook for 2025, projecting slower growth in life insurance policies amid cost-of-living challenges. ISP growth remains a key strength, with mid- to high-single-digit gains anticipated, supported by favorable demographics and expanded product offerings. Management’s focus on scalability, disciplined cash flow management, and strategic investments in technology position the company for sustained long-term growth despite near-term headwinds.
