Earnings Call Insights: Alpine Income Property Trust (NYSE:[PINE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINE "Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO John Albright highlighted a strong Q4, achieving AFFO of $1.74 per diluted share for the year, reflecting 17% growth. The company raised its quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, effective Q1 2025. Albright emphasized the continuation of the strategy to increase annual dividends since the IPO in 2019.
* The company completed acquisitions of six properties for $50.5 million in Q4, bringing the 2024 total to 12 properties valued at $103.6 million. The weighted average cash cap rate for the full year acquisitions was 8.2%. Major tenants include Best Buy, DICK'S Sporting Goods, and Lowe’s.
* Portfolio pruning efforts led to $62 million in property sales, reducing Walgreens’ position from the largest tenant to the fourth-largest. Newly acquired tenants such as Lowe’s and DICK’S Sporting Goods now represent 10% of annualized base rent ([ABR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABR "Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.")) each.
* CFO Philip Mays reported Q4 total revenue of $13.8 million, driven by $11.5 million in lease income and $2.2 million in interest income from commercial loans. AFFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, up 16% year-over-year.
* Mays added that 2024 equity issuance under the ATM program generated $18.8 million in net proceeds, aiding in reducing debt leverage to 7.4x net debt to EBITDA by year-end.

### Outlook

* For 2025, Alpine provided AFFO and FFO guidance of $1.70 to $1.73 per diluted share. Key assumptions include $50 million to $80 million in acquisitions and $20 million to $30 million in dispositions.
* The Party City bankruptcy and the failure of Cinemark to renew a lease were identified as potential headwinds, impacting 2025 AFFO by approximately $0.08 per share. However, management expressed confidence in mitigating these challenges through timely acquisitions and redeployments.
* CEO Albright reiterated the company’s barbell strategy for 2025, balancing stable investment-grade acquisitions with higher-yielding opportunities.

### Financial Results

* Q4 FFO and AFFO were both $0.44 per diluted share, with total revenue reaching $13.8 million. Yearly totals included $52.2 million in revenue, $1.73 FFO per share, and $1.74 AFFO per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18% and 17%, respectively.
* Portfolio restructuring led to an average yield of 8.7% on 2024 investments, while dispositions averaged a cap rate of 6.9%, creating a positive spread.
* Liquidity stood at $95 million, with an additional $50 million available through an expanded credit facility.
* The company maintained a healthy AFFO payout ratio of 64%, supporting its increased dividend policy.

* Q4 acquisitions ($50.5 million) were slightly below Q3’s ($55 million), though the weighted average cap rate for acquisitions increased to 8.2% in 2024 from Q3’s 8.8%.
* Management confidence remained strong despite new headwinds from Party City and Cinemark, suggesting proactive measures to mitigate risks.
* Analysts in Q4 focused more on credit risks and tenant-specific concerns compared to Q3’s emphasis on transaction activity and macro trends.

### Risks and Concerns
