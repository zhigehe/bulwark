Electric vehicle enterprise **BYD Company Limited** ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) has made for a lot of good news in 2024 with the company being on an aggressive international expansion campaign. BYD also out-performed its biggest EV rival Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) in Q4 2024 in terms of deliveries. Now, BYD has debuted its own advanced driver assistance technology, called God's Eye, which is set to compete against other driver assistance programs, such as Tesla's full self-drive system, or FSD, and Google's ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) Waymo Driver. BYD also said that it would equip its low-cost electric vehicle models, such as the BYD Seagull, with its fully autonomous driving technology, which could further add to margin pressure in the electric vehicle market, especially in China.

Previous Rating
---------------

I recommended shares of BYD as a Strong Buy in my last work on the Chinese EV giant, mainly because the electric vehicle maker was a cost-leader in the industry and achieved the [highest gross margins](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740892-byd-dont-worry-about-supplier-costs) in the sector. BYD's announcement to include its advanced driver assistance system/ADAS into its entire EV fleet indicates that the company plans to double down on its low-cost EV strategy, which may force other EV companies to follow suit.

**BYD's God's Eye Release, Mainly a Threat to Chinese Competitors**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

BYD this week dropped a bombshell on the EV industry by announcing that its advanced driver assistance program, dubbed God's Eye, will be [introduced as a standard](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406050-ev-jolts-byd-company-hits-record-high-as-gods-eye-driver-assistance-features-shakes-up-the-sector) on all its electric vehicles, including low-cost models. The company's God's Eye has Level 2 Autonomy, which means that while the computer can take over various functions such as acceleration, braking and steering, driver attention is required at all times.

BYD is going to offer its ADAS at varying tiers, however: its most capable ADAS, God's Eye A, will be available in the company's luxury brand Yangwang which includes three lidar units. God's Eye B, which has one lidar unit, will be used for the company's higher-priced EVs while the third tier, God's Eye C, will be used for BYD's low-cost models -- such as the BYD Seagull, BYD Qin Plus and BYD Seal.

For context, Tesla's FSD has Level 2 Autonomy while the most advanced driver technology currently available comes from Waymo… with its Waymo Driver advanced driver assistance program having Level 4 Autonomy. At Level 5 Autonomy, a vehicle can operate fully autonomously. Currently, no U.S. or Chinese company I am aware of has achieved Level 5 Autonomy.

The main take-away from BYD's news this week is not, however, that God's Eye has a competitive advantage over Tesla's FSD, as both companies operate at about the same level of autonomy (Level 2). The real news is that the Chinese EV company, which follows a low-cost strategy and competes aggressively on price, said that it will include its advanced driver assistance program in its low-price EVs… Therefore, forcing other electric vehicle companies in China, and potentially even in the U.S., to follow suit. Including high-performance ADAS into entry models obviously costs money and could have a negative margin impact on EV companies… which are already reeling from margin pressures as well as slowing demand. Since BYD also sells its cars mostly in Asia, Latin America and Europe, the impact on Tesla, in my opinion, is negligible.

As I indicated in my last work on BYD, the Chinese EV firm has the strongest gross margins in the sector (as well as the largest global factory output after overtaking Tesla in Q4 2024). BYD's margins are much better than those of other EV start-ups, with Li Auto ([LI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LI "Li Auto Inc.")) being an exception. Tesla's gross margins have come a bit under pressure in the last quarter as well, and BYD now has a considerable margin lead over the U.S. company. I recently rated Tesla a sell -- [No Safety Margin](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754159-tesla-no-safety-margin) -- due to the company's stretched valuation.

**BYD Overtakes Tesla Again as a Leading Global EV Maker**
----------------------------------------------------------

A much bigger threat than BYD's God's Eye ADAS is the fact that the company has recently overtaken Tesla again in terms of global delivery volume. BYD is China's leading EV company and sells both battery-powered and hybrid electric vehicles. It has a massive delivery volume as the largest volume-producer in China and surpassed Tesla in terms of deliveries in the fourth-quarter: in Q4 2024, Tesla delivered 495,570 electric vehicles compared to 595,413 passenger battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, which BYD delivered to its customers. It was the second time that BYD out-performed Tesla in terms of quarterly deliveries (the first time being Q4 2023).

With BYD moving to the global number 1 spot in terms of delivery growth and having a margin advantage over other EV companies, including Tesla, I believe investors may want to consider BYD as a long-term growth investment as well.

**BYD's Valuation Compared to Tesla**
-------------------------------------

Tesla, as the largest U.S. electric vehicle company by market cap, is trading at a significant premium to other EV companies, including Rivian Automotive ([RIVN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIVN "Rivian Automotive, Inc.")). Tesla is highly valued based off revenues because the company has considerable potential in the electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle markets, and dominates the U.S. market.

BYD is still by far the cheapest electric vehicle maker in the large-cap EV market, mainly because of its China focus. BYD is valued at a FY 2025 P/S ratio of 1.04X compared to 9.7X for Tesla, and a 2.5X price-to-revenue ratio for Rivian.

The valuation discrepancy between BYD and Tesla is quite high. It mostly relates back to my argument that U.S. investors are very hesitant to invest in China-based electric vehicle companies due to murky ownership structures as well as transparency issues following the CCP's crackdown on the tech sector a few years back.

However, BYD is still very much undervalued, in my opinion, and has a fair value in the neighborhood of $86 per-share, based off a fair value P/S ratio of ~2.0X. This multiplier would be justified, in my opinion, given that BYD is the largest global EV company by factor output, has a margin lead over Tesla (while trading at a massive discount) and just made a game-changing move with its ADAS that will force other EV companies to follow suit.

**Risks with BYD**
------------------

The biggest risk for BYD, as I see it, relates to the company's margin trajectory. Including advanced driver assistance program into entry EV models will increase competition, raise costs and lower margins for electric vehicle companies, especially in China. BYD still leads the sector in terms of margins, so maybe it is not surprising that the EV firm is ratcheting up competitive pressures in the industry. What would change my mind about BYD is if the company were to see slowing delivery growth and faltering gross margins.

**Final Thoughts**
------------------

BYD's God's Eye advanced driver assistance program is set to be more of a headache for Chinese EV companies than for Tesla. The inclusion of God's Eye in low-cost EVs such as the BYD Seagull, BYD Qin Plus and BYD Seal will offer buyers of a BYD more value. Therefore, it will force other EV companies to include advanced driver assistance systems for free in entry models. While I don't see much of an advantage for God's Eye relative to Tesla's Full-Driving System as both have Level 2 Autonomy, BYD's inclusion of God's Eye is likely going to increase pricing pressure for all electric vehicle manufacturers in the long term.
