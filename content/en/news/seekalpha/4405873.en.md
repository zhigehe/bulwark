Gold prices settled above $2,900/oz for the first time Monday, driven by continued safe-haven demand after President Trump announced plans on Sunday to impose additional 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, and said he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week, matching rates imposed by other countries and applying them immediately.

"Obviously the tariff war is behind the rise; it just reflects more uncertainty and more tension in the global trade situation," Marex analyst Edward Meir [said](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-hovers-near-all-time-highs-trumps-tariff-threats-lift-safe-haven-demand-2025-02-10/ "said"), adding that if U.S. Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data due later in the week surprise on the downside, it may weigh on the dollar and inflate gold prices, while an upside surprise could push up U.S. yields and strain gold, although likely just mildly due to the market's resilience and buyer interest during dips.

Safe-haven demand for gold is surging as anxiety grows over the potential impact to global economic growth prospects from the Trump administration's protectionist drive, as well as its inflationary effect on U.S. domestic prices, ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista [said](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-partial-recovery-from-friday-s-losses/card/gold-jumps-to-fresh-record-highs-on-growing-anxiety-over-trump-s-protectionist-drive--6Ab08dIo1Bm3pU3k48Nr "said"), and that against the backdrop of Trump's promised new tariffs on steel and aluminum, "gold risk remains tilted to the upside, with further price gains possible in the near term."

Front-month Comex gold ([XAUUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR "Gold Spot Price")) for February delivery closed +1.6% to $2914.30/oz, a new all-time high settlement, and front-month February silver ([XAGUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR "Silver Spot Price")) finished +0.2% to $32.392/oz.
