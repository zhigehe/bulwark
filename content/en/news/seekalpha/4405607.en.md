Energy Transfer (NYSE:[ET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET "Energy Transfer LP Common Units")) +1.2% in early trading Monday after saying it entered into a long-term [natural gas supply agreement](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996437-energy-transfer-and-cloudburst-sign-agreement-for-natural-gas-supply-to-data-center-project "natural gas supply agreement") with CloudBurst Data Centers for an AI-focused data center development in central Texas, its first commercial arrangement to supply natural gas directly to a data center.

Energy Transfer (NYSE:[ET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET "Energy Transfer LP Common Units")) said it will provide as much as 450K MMBtu/day of firm natural gas supply hrough its Oasis Pipeline to CloudBurst's campus near San Marcos, Texas, subject to CloubBurst reaching a final investment decision with its customer, which is expected later this year; the facility would be operational by Q3 2026.

The gas supply will generate up to nearly 1.2 GW of direct electric power for a period of at least 10 years starting with Phase 1 of the data center facilities, Energy Transfer ([ET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET "Energy Transfer LP Common Units")) said.

The company said it is in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects the CloudBurst agreement will be "the first of many" to supply, store and transport natural gas to fuel data centers, electric generation facilities and other power demand customers.
