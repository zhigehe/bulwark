### Management View

* Acting CEO Roger Hartelius highlighted a 20% revenue growth in Q4 2024, with 25% organic growth.

The company achieved an EBIT margin of 47%, with nonrecurring items contributing SEK 25M. Adjusted EBIT margin would have been 42% without these items.
* Hartelius emphasized Fortnox's focus on increasing average revenue per customer ([OTCPK:ARPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARPC "Arem Pacific Corporation")), which rose to SEK 298 per month. He stated, "We will focus even more on usage, which will drive the average revenue per customer."

* Fortnox plans to continue integrating payments and financial services into its ecosystem, aiming to improve user experience and create new revenue streams.

### Financial Results

* The company reported stable free cash flow, adjusted for lending and acquisitions.

### Q&A

* Charles Brennan, Jefferies: Inquired about potential deemphasis of noncore business flows. Hartelius clarified that all core workflows, including payments and financing, remain central to operations.
* Georg Attling, Pareto: Questioned Q4 cost increases. Hartelius attributed the rise to seasonal expenses, including marketing and consulting, and clarified that it was not indicative of a structural cost increase.
