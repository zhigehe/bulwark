Earnings Call Insights: Byrna Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:[BYRN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYRN "Byrna Technologies Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Bryan Ganz highlighted record Q4 revenue of $28 million and annual revenue of $85.8 million, reflecting over 100% growth year-over-year. He emphasized the success of the new advertising strategy, which included celebrity endorsements achieving a 5x return on advertising spend.
* The company surpassed the milestone of 500,000 launchers sold, reinforcing its position as a leader in the less-lethal personal defense market.
* Byrna is expanding its retail footprint with the opening of four new stores, including locations in Nashville, Scottsdale, Salem, and Fort Wayne. Each store is expected to reach full profitability within four to six months of opening.
* CFO Lauri Kearnes reported a gross profit margin improvement to 62.8% for Q4, driven by higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels and cost reductions. She also noted that net income for the quarter reached $9.7 million, up from a loss in the prior year.

### Outlook

* The launch of Byrna’s Compact Launcher is scheduled for mid-2025, with management expecting it to drive significant revenue and margin growth.
* Byrna plans to expand its "store within a store" partnership with Sportsman’s Warehouse, starting with 11 locations in Q2 2025 and potentially scaling to 100 locations by 2026.
* CEO Ganz noted strong demand in Canada and Mexico, with sales in these markets projected to grow to $4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in 2025.
* Management anticipates strong double-digit revenue growth for 2025, supported by new product launches, increased retail presence, and expanded advertising efforts.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue reached $28 million, up 79% year-over-year, while full-year revenue grew to $85.8 million, more than doubling from 2023.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $5.2 million, compared to $400,000 in the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.5 million.
* Cash and short-term marketable securities stood at $25.7 million, reflecting a $5.2 million increase year-over-year. The company reported no debt.
* Operating expenses rose to $13.5 million in Q4, reflecting investments in marketing, payroll, and retail expansion.

### Q&A

* Matthew Koranda, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked about Q1 sales trends and potential impacts from the loss of a celebrity endorser. CEO Ganz responded that Q1 would remain strong but not surpass Q4 due to seasonality. He downplayed the impact of losing Governor Mike Huckabee as an endorser, citing his smaller contribution relative to other influencers.
* Jeff Van Sinderen, B. Riley Securities: Inquired about the timeline for evaluating the success of the Sportsman’s Warehouse partnership. CEO Ganz estimated a three to four-month period to assess profitability and scalability before expanding beyond the initial 11 locations.
* Jon Hickman, Ladenburg Thalman: Asked about the costs associated with the "store within a store" model. CFO Kearnes clarified that Byrna would contribute $7,500 per store, significantly lower than the $200,000-$250,000 investment required for standalone stores.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were generally positive, focusing on the company’s growth trajectory, retail expansion, and product pipeline. Questions centered on operational scalability and the financial impact of new initiatives.
* Management conveyed confidence in its ability to sustain growth through strategic investments and operational efficiencies. Statements like “we expect margins to exceed” and “we believe that this new launch will provide significant sales boost” reflected optimism.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone remained optimistic, with increased emphasis on new partnerships and international growth.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue grew significantly from $20.9 million in Q3 to $28 million in Q4, driven by robust direct-to-consumer sales.
* Gross margin improved from 62.4% in Q3 to 62.8% in Q4, reflecting higher-margin product sales and cost efficiencies.
* The focus shifted from initial rollout plans for retail stores in Q3 to execution and expansion in Q4, including the Sportsman’s Warehouse partnership and new store openings.
* Management confidence remained consistent, while analysts continued to explore operational scalability and incremental growth opportunities.

### Risks and Concerns

* Potential challenges in ramping up new retail locations, with stores requiring four to six months to achieve profitability.
* Dependence on advertising partnerships, with management terminating underperforming endorsers.
* International trade policies and tariffs, though management emphasized minimal exposure due to diversified sourcing and plans to exit China by mid-2025.

### Final Takeaway

The company is leveraging new partnerships, product launches, and retail expansion to sustain its growth trajectory into 2025. Management’s focus on operational efficiencies, coupled with strategic investments in advertising and international markets, positions Byrna for continued profitability and market leadership in the less-lethal defense space.
