The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, after President Donald Trump threatened new [tariffs on metal imports](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405425-trump-says-he-will-impose-25-tariffs-on-all-steel-aluminum-imports-reports), sparking concerns of a global trade war.

The greenback was last up 0.21%, at $108.27, as investors continued to look to the dollar as a safe haven. 

**Dollar weekly moves and key drivers:** 

The U.S. Dollar Index ([DXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY "US Dollar Index")), which measures the value of the dollar against a basket of six foreign currencies, fell 0.48% over the last week.

The dollar fell over the week as investors remained uncertain around global trade. These uncertainties were sparked after Trump first imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and paused them later.

He stuck with tariffs on goods from China, which was immediately met with retaliatory duties from China on US goods.

The greenback’s strength rose later in the week after Trump said he will impose reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners. The dollar’s momentum further picked up after he said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US later on Monday.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) fell 10 basis points over the week to 4.47%, while the shorter-end, 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) fell one point to 4.26%.

**Currency Highlights: Major currency movements (Feb 3 to Feb 9)** 

   | Euro ([EUR:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUR:USD "Euro / US Dollar")) | +0.07% |
| --- | --- |
| Pound Sterling ([GBP:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBP:USD "British Pound / US Dollar")) | -0.08% |
| Japanese Yen ([JPY:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPY:USD "Japanese Yen / US Dollar")) | +2.17% |
| Chinese Yuan ([CNY:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNY:USD "Chinese Yuan / US Dollar")) | -0.13% |
| Swiss Franc ([CHF:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHF:USD "Swiss Franc / US Dollar")) | -0.06% |
| Australian Dollar ([AUD:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUD:USD "Australian Dollar / US Dollar")) | +1.24% |
| Canadian Dollar ([CAD:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAD:USD "Canadian Dollar / US Dollar")) | +0.74% |

The euro ([EUR:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUR:USD "Euro / US Dollar")) despite the slight gain last week, was down 0.1% on Monday, as investors remained uncertain about tariffs against Europe, which Trump has repeatedly hinted at.

The British pound ([GBP:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBP:USD "British Pound / US Dollar")) continued its losses against the dollar on Monday after the Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week.

The Japanese yen ([JPY:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPY:USD "Japanese Yen / US Dollar")) was down 0.22% against the greenback, after gaining more than 2% in the last week. The yen’s sharp gain over the week was sparked by a strong wage data along with hawkish comments from the BOJ, raising hopes of more rate hikes in the coming months.

**Market reactions and analysis:** 

According to Paul Donovan from UBS, taxing steel and aluminum is less visible to the end consumer. “Taxing (bulk) imports from China are also less visible. Trade taxes in these areas are likely to be more enduring. They are still economically negative, but there are potentially fewer second-round effects," he added.

ING analysts believe that uncertainty about the nature, timing and magnitude of tariffs will likely keep the dollar supported this week.

“…for the time being, we doubt investors will want to let go of overweight positions in the dollar, and we can see DXY edging towards the top of a 108-109 trading range through the early part of this week,” ING analysts wrote in a note.

**Economic Indicators to watch:** 

Traders look forward to a macroeconomic data-heavy week, with the January retail inflation report on Wednesday and the wholesale inflation data on Thursday.

On Wednesday, traders will get their first look at January inflation with the scheduled release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Federal Reserve chair Powell is scheduled to testify before Congress this week, where he will likely focus on interest rates and the current economic environment.
