Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:[OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) +0.8% pre-market Wednesday after Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) ([BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) made a small purchase of the energy company, [increasing its stake to 28.3%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-occidental-stock-price-3ffdcb94 "increasing its stake to 28.3%").

On February 7, Warren Buffett's firm bought an additional 763,017 Occidental (NYSE:[OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) shares valued at ~$35.7M, purchased in a single lot at a weighted average price of $46.8195/share, according to an [SEC filing](https://occidentalpetroleum.gcs-web.com/static-files/550cb444-5666-4dd9-ae73-271fe357794e "SEC filing") late Tuesday.

Following the latest stock purchase, Berkshire ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) ([BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) now owns more than 264.9M Occidental ([OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) common shares, worth ~$12.9B, as well as ~$8.5B worth of Occidental preferred stock and 83.86M convertible warrants that allow it to buy the common stock at slightly below $60/share.

Berkshire's ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) ([BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) last Occidental ([OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) purchase was [in December](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4389229-occidental-petroleum-rises-after-berkshire-hathaway-raises-stake "in December"), when it bought ~8.9M shares at a ~$46/share average.

Berkshire ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) ([BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) likely is losing money on its Occidental ([OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) stake, according to Andrew Bary at *Barronâ€™s*, estimating its cost in the low $50s.
