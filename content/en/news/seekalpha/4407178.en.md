Earnings Call Insights: Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. ([OTCQX:ADRNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADRNY "Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Frans Muller emphasized the company's commitment to its Growing Together strategy, highlighting robust performance and strategic growth initiatives despite a challenging environment. Key achievements included surpassing cost-saving targets with €1.35 billion saved in 2024 and launching digital innovations such as AI-driven customer solutions and modular e-commerce platforms in Europe.
* He noted strong progress in densifying markets, citing the opening of new GIANT Company stores in Philadelphia and increased remodeling efforts in the U.S. and Europe. Muller also shared that 95% of the GIANT Company's store fleet is now remodeled.
* CFO Jolanda Poots-Bijl stated, "Net sales grew 0.6% to €23.3 billion during the quarter," and the company achieved a full-year free cash flow of over €2.5 billion, exceeding guidance. She also announced a proposed 6.4% dividend increase to €1.17 per share.

### Outlook

* The company projects a 4% underlying operating margin, mid- to high single-digit underlying EPS growth, and free cash flow of at least €2.2 billion for 2025. Capital expenditure is expected to rise to €2.7 billion, reflecting investments in growth and technology.
* Management disclosed that the integration of Profi will add approximately €3 billion in net sales and involve opening around 100 new stores.
* Muller stated, "We are ready to step up our brand's organic store growth and remodeling program in the U.S."

### Financial Results

* Q4 net sales reached €23.3 billion, with online sales increasing by 5.8%. Adjusted for the divestment of FreshDirect, several brands, including Albert Heijn and Food Lion, achieved double-digit online sales growth.
* Underlying operating margin for Q4 was 4.1%, slightly down year-over-year due to lower nonrecurring items in the U.S. Diluted underlying EPS for the quarter was €0.69, contributing to €2.54 for the full year.
* The company achieved €1.3 billion in Q4 free cash flow, driven by strong holiday sales and cost management.

### Q&A

* Robert Jan Vos, ABN AMRO ODDO BHF: Asked about the expected European EBIT margin including Profi. CFO Poots-Bijl replied that Profi will trend towards the European region's 4% margin over time, with synergy benefits starting in 2026.
* William Woods, Bernstein: Queried the impact of price investments on U.S. margins. CEO Muller highlighted positive volume growth in the U.S., stating, "We see positive upticks for Stop & Shop in the start of the year with the price investments."
* Sreedhar Mahamkali, UBS: Asked about the phasing of price investments. Muller confirmed that investments are spread across 2025, with early positive effects observed in Q4 2024.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were cautious but focused heavily on U.S. margin sustainability and the impact of price investments. Questions indicated skepticism about the trajectory of Stop & Shop and broader U.S. margin recovery.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing achievements and strategic milestones. Muller expressed optimism with phrases like "We are very happy with the momentum" and "We have a clear plan for the year."
* Compared to Q3, management's sentiment showed increased confidence in growth strategies, particularly in Europe and digital innovations.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted from reiterating a 4% margin goal in Q3 to specifying a 2025 target of "around 4%."
* Management tone improved, reflecting strong holiday season results and early momentum from price investments in the U.S.
* Analysts' focus on U.S. margins remained consistent, though concerns about cost pressures and competitive pricing persisted.
* Key metric changes included an uptick in U.S. volumes and stronger online sales growth compared to Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted ongoing inflationary pressures and cost challenges. Muller stated that maintaining affordability for customers remains a priority.
* Analysts raised concerns about the sustainability of U.S. margins amidst price investments and competitive dynamics.
* Potential integration challenges with Profi and its initial dilutive impact on margins were noted.

### Final Takeaway
