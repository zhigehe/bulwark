AEP reported Q4 operating earnings of $1.24 per share, totaling $5.62 for the year. The company reaffirmed its 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share and maintained its long-term growth target of 6%-8%, underpinned by a robust $54 billion capital plan for 2025-2029.
* Fehrman highlighted significant restructuring efforts, including streamlining the leadership structure by reducing management layers and enhancing supplier procurement processes to deliver higher value. AEP also announced a $2.82 billion minority interest transaction in its transmission business, expected to close in the second half of 2025, with proceeds strengthening the balance sheet and supporting capital investments.
* CFO Trevor Mihalik presented the financial results, noting a $0.37 increase in operating earnings per share year-over-year due to rate changes and normalized retail sales growth. He emphasized the company’s commitment to disciplined capital allocation and maintaining strong credit metrics, with $4.6 billion in liquidity supported by $6 billion in credit facilities.

### Outlook

* AEP reaffirmed its 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share and detailed plans for an incremental $10 billion in potential investment beyond its $54 billion capital plan. These investments will focus on transmission, distribution, and generation infrastructure to meet growing energy demand.
* The company anticipates substantial growth driven by increased data center and industrial load demand, projecting 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030. AEP also highlighted ongoing regulatory engagements to ensure fair cost allocation associated with large loads and to secure favorable outcomes for key initiatives.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter operating earnings were $1.24 per share, aligning with analysts' estimates, while annual operating earnings reached $5.62 per share, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase. The vertically integrated utilities and transmission segments demonstrated strong growth, supported by rate changes, higher retail sales, and incremental investments.
* Commercial load growth reached 12.3% in Q4 and 10.6% for the year, driven by data center expansions in Ohio, Texas, and Indiana. Industrial sales also rose significantly, particularly in Texas, showcasing the diversity of AEP’s growth opportunities.
