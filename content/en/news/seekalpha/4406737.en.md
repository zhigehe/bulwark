Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:[BAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAM "Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.")) stock climbed 3.0% in Wednesday premarket trading as its Q4 earnings topped Wall Street consensus, with fundraising driving growth in fee-bearing capital year-over-year and lower expenses helping to offset lower revenue.

[Q4 distributable EPS of $0.40,](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999471-brookfield-asset-management-announces-record-2024-results-and-15-percent-dividend-increase "Q4 distributable EPS of $0.40,") beating the average analyst estimate of $0.39, increased from $0.38 in Q3 and $0.36 in Q4 2023.

Fee-related earnings of $649M rose from $644M in the previous quarter and $586M a year ago.

Q4 revenue of $1.06B, trailing the $1.26B consensus, fell from $1.12B in Q3 and $1.13B in the prior year's Q4. Other revenue slid to $84M from $140M in the prior quarter and $340M in the year-ago period.

Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:[BAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAM "Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.")) raised $29B of capital during the quarter, including $20B within credit, $4.2B within renewable energy, $2.5B within infrastructure, $1.8B within private equity, and over $700 within real estate. That compared with total fundraising of $21B in Q3 and $68B in Q2.

"Fundraising momentum, alongside annual capital deployments of $48B drove year-over-year growth of 18% for our fee-bearing capital, and 17% for our fourth quarter fee-related earnings,‚Äù said President Connor Teskey.

During the quarter, fee-bearing capital benefitted from fundraising within its transition and real estate flagship funds, deployments within its infrastructure debt fund, and net asset value increases across Oaktree perpetual credit funds, partially offset by a decrease in listed affiliate share prices, the company said.

It deployed $16B of capital during the quarter vs. $20B in Q3. The company also monetized or agreed to sell $9B of investments in the quarter, it said.

Total assets under management stayed at above $1T at the end of the quarter. Fee-bearing capital totaled $539B at the end of 2024, unchanged Q/Q and up18% Y/Y.

Brookfield ([BAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAM "Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.")) has $115B of uncalled commitments, also called dry power, that's ready to deploy, vs. $106B in the prior quarter.

Q4 expenses of $412M decreased from $438M in Q3 and $419M in Q4 2023.
