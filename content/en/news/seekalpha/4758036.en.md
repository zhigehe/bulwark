Ever since Asana (NYSE:[ASAN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN "Asana, Inc.")) reached its peak valuation in November 2021, the stock has been in gradual decline. ASAN has now dropped about 85% from its highs, and only returned about 4% since August 2023 when I last [covered the company](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4632304-asana-stock-positive-signals-but-no-reason-to-own-yet). And despite ASAN's recent price surge, I still don't see any particular signs of a turnaround, which again leads to a conclusion that there is no reason to own the stock yet.

The bad: slowing revenue growth, no profitability, declining retention, and advancing competitors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually, in the case of a Hold rating, I try to start with some positives about the company, but looking at the dynamics around Asana, there seems to be too many negative signs.

The first and most obvious one is the slowdown in [Asana's revenue growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN/earnings). In the last two years, the pace of growth has gone down from 41% year-over-year to just 10%. Even though some deceleration might have been expected due to the general economic slowdown, it seems to have happened too fast without any signs of recovery.

 [![ASAN's earnings history from FQ3 '23 to FQ3 '25](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393558150784402.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393558150784402_origin.png)

Moreover, this sales slowdown comes during the times when many companies experience a boost to their revenues thanks to their AI offerings and general digitalization trends. Asana's direct competitors like Atlassian ([TEAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEAM "Atlassian Corporation")) or monday.com ([MNDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNDY "monday.com Ltd.")) both enjoy strong revenue increases at the moment, with a 21% and 32% revenue growth in their latest quarters, respectively.

A comparison with monday.com makes Asana's problems even more evident here. Just two years ago, the two companies' quarterly revenue was about equal, but now MNDY has overtaken ASAN by a significant margin. Even though there might be market for several similar SaaS products out there, this increased competition still makes Asana's situation more difficult.

Regarding Asana's AI offerings, the [AI-powered productivity program](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4005280-why-did-asana-stock-go-up-today-ai-powered-productivity-program-launched) was launched about 1.5 years ago, which sent the stock up 7% when the news became public. I raised my doubts about Asana's AI effectiveness in my previous article, and now it seems like the offering has indeed not become a selling point so far, judging by the numbers. This also makes me skeptical about the new AI Studio program [introduced by the company](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4370301-asana-elevates-receives-upgrade-on-earnings-turnaround-analysts) recently. While AI Studio might become an interesting product in the future, there is no evidence to support its effectiveness yet. Therefore, the recent post-FQ3 surge in the stock price does not seem justified.

My concerns about Asana's future growth become even more relevant considering Asana's declining retention rates. The company's dollar-based net retention rate was more than 110% at the time of my last article in August 2023. This was one of the positive characteristics of Asana, as a retention rate higher than a 100% means users are satisfied with the service and the company is able to grow its revenue organically from its existing users, which reduces the need for high marketing spend.

In the latest quarter, however, Asana's [dollar-based retention dropped to just 96%](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19938709-asana-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false). Even for Asana's "core" customers, those who spend $5000 and more, the retention rate was below 100% at 98%. For comparison, [monday.com's dollar retention rate](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405497-monday_com-soars-after-q4-outlook-beats-estimates-plans-to-double-down-on-ai-efforts) was 112% in Q4 2024.

Asana is also one of the weakest SaaS companies when it comes to profitability. While ASAN's gross margin is relatively high at 89%, the company has the worst net income margin, the worst EBITDA margin, and the lowest FCF margin.

 [![Profitability comparison between ASAN and peers](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393582201891727.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393582201891727_origin.png)

Asana's low profitability is driven by substantial sales and marketing expenses â€” the company spent almost 64% of its gross income on that expense category in [the latest quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9326965). Moreover, I find it rather alarming that the company spent 26% more on sales and marketing than on research and development. Given Asana's focus on AI offerings, I would expect R&D to be the company's first priority at the moment, but R&D only increased 6% in the first 9 months of the current fiscal year vs. almost 11% increase in S&M. To compare with monday.com again, the latter [increased its R&D budget](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996316-monday-com-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false) by about 37% in 2024.

Then comes ASAN's valuation. Slowing growth would not be a big issue for a stable and profitable company, but Asana is far from being one. Even if there is some progress in achieving profitability, Asana will still remain one of the highest-valued companies among its peers, based on multiples. For instance, looking at a 3-year forward P/E, Asana is valued almost 3 times higher than Atlassian or monday.com, who are already profitable on a non-GAAP basis.

 [![Valuation comparison between ASAN and peers](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393583434457452.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/42686696-17393583434457452_origin.png)

Overall, Asana's slowing growth, uncertain future, and lack of catalysts don't make me enthusiastic about the stock.

### The good, upcoming earnings, and what could change the thesis

The negative points above do not mean Asana will have significant financial issues in the near future, since one of the positive points about the company is its relatively strong balance sheet. In the latest quarter, ASAN reported about $455 million in cash and marketable securities, with virtually no debt apart from a $39 million term loan. Moreover, Asana is very close to becoming cash flow positive, as most of its expenses actually come from stock-based compensation. Therefore, I don't expect Asana will need to fight for its survival any time soon.

Moreover, ASAN trades at a relatively modest forward P/S ratio of 6.4, which is more than 2 times lower than that of MNDY. If Asana finds a way to increase its profitability fast, the stock might start getting revalued upward.

Asana's next earnings report is scheduled for March 10, according to Seeking Alpha. The market expects $188.1 million in revenue, which would represent a 10% increase year-over-year, and $-0.01 in EPS. What I would watch for are the following points:

* ASAN's dollar-based retention rates: if this metric continues to drop further, a return to higher revenue growth will be much more difficult. A positive development would be a return to a retention rate >100%, at least for the "core" customers.
* Profitability and cash flow: Asana is very close to becoming profitable on a non-GAAP basis, which would certainly help the overall narrative. If the company beats on EPS or shows solid positive operating cash flow, it would be a strong sign.
* Further commentary regarding Asana AI Studio: this project is in its early stages, but many investors base their hopes about ASAN on its AI future. If there are positive developments there and AI Studio is rolled out to more customers, we can expect a positive reaction from the market.

Key takeaways
-------------

Despite the recent surge in Asana's stock price, the company's fundamentals do not show any signs of strength at the moment. Apart from ASAN's strong balance sheet and a potential return to growth with AI offerings, there are no reasons to own the stock at the moment. With a dollar-based retention rate dipping well below 100% and lagging behind competitors like monday.com, it will be difficult for Asana to accelerate its revenue in the near future. Therefore, the stock remains a Hold.
