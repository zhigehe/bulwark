“Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered and will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday.

In a [statement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_469 " statement ") released today, von der Leyen vowed to respond to 25% tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump said America will impose on steel and aluminum imports.

“I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Tariffs are taxes - bad for business, worse for consumers. […] The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests. We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,” von der Leyen said.

EU Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said the tariffs are “economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties”.

President Trump [signed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405874-trump-signs-order-imposing-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum " signed ") executive orders late Monday imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., canceling all exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries.

The proclamations signed at the White House were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers.

"This is the beginning of making America rich again," Trump said in the Oval Office, as he signed dual executive orders for steel and aluminum tariffs. "No exceptions, no nothing," Trump added.
