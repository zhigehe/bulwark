BlackJack3D





With the stock markets bouncing around nervously around all-time highs and a volatile earnings season underway, I think it’s prudent for investors to adopt a more risk-aware mindset. Actions I’m taking include reducing my exposure to equities (by around 20% and shifting to short-term T-bills) and selling more of my winners to rotate more of my portfolio to “growth at a reasonable price” stocks.

In particular, this earnings season has created appealing buy opportunities in a number of undervalued stocks, and Freshworks (NASDAQ:[FRSH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRSH "Freshworks Inc.")) is chief among them. The enterprise software company fell slightly after reporting strong Q4 results and a decent guide for FY25, bringing its losses over the past year to nearly 20% - a great entry point for investors new to this name.

[I last wrote a bullish note on Freshworks in December](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742829-freshworks-just-became-far-more-shareholder-friendly-and-it-is-time-to-jump-in), when it was trading at similar ~$17 levels. Since then, Freshworks has delivered strong growth while also benefiting from a recent decision to lay off 13% of its headcount, boosting its margin profile. With this in mind, I’m not hesitating to reiterate my **buy rating** on Freshworks.

The reason that now is a great time to buy Freshworks is that its valuation gap to similar-growth peers has widened, with investors as usual reacting sharply to an initial guidance outlook for FY25. At issue is the fact that Freshworks’ guidance for $809-$821 million calls for revenue growth to decelerate sharply to a 12-14% y/y range. This contrasts sharply with recent growth trends in the low 20s, where growth in Freshworks’ second half accelerated over the first.

Freshworks outlook (Freshworks Q4 earnings deck)





Of course, there’s the issue of a tough comp against Freshworks’ strong performance in FY24. Yet, I find two reasons not to be concerned.

The first is that Freshworks, like many software companies, tends to adopt a more conservative guidance stance, especially to start off the year. We note that at the end of FY23, the company had guided to 18-19% growth for FY24. In actuality, growth clocked in at 21% y/y, exceeding even the high end of the initial range by two points. Arguably as well, FY24 was a difficult year to beat estimates, as macro conditions were challenged and many software companies reported delayed deal closings and de-prioritization of projects that didn’t have immediate urgency (such as AI-related deployments). And yet, Freshworks delivered a healthy beat. To me, the company is setting itself up nicely for a sequence of consistent beat-and-raise quarters in the year ahead.

The second point to consider: Freshworks’ cheap valuation, in my view, already more than compensates for any slowdown in growth. At current post-earnings drop share prices near $17, Freshworks trades at a market cap of $5.19 billion. After netting off the $1.07 billion of cash on its latest balance sheet (yet another reason to be long on Freshworks: the company has quite a sizable cash pile encumbered of debt, especially relative to its market cap and revenue - giving it plenty of flexibility to pursue growth initiatives, organic or otherwise), the company’s resulting **enterprise value is $4.12 billion.**

Against the $815 million midpoint of Freshworks’ guidance (which as I noted is likely on the conservative side), Freshworks trades at **5.1x EV/FY25 revenue.** Meanwhile, the list of enterprise software companies that are expected to grow at a similar mid-teens pace in FY25, yet trade at much higher multiples, is quite long and includes industry bellwethers like Salesforce ([CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM "Salesforce, Inc.")), a direct competitor to Freshworks’ CRM division, as well as other names like HubSpot ([HUBS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS "HubSpot, Inc.")) and Workday ([WDAY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDAY "Workday, Inc.")):

**My updated price target on Freshworks is $21,** representing 6.5x EV/FY25 revenue and ~20% upside from current levels. If you don’t have a stake yet in this fantastic growth stock, the post-earnings dip is a great juncture to start.

Let’s now go through Freshworks’ latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:

 [![Freshworks Q4 results](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/33427965-17394746453837132.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/33427965-17394746453837132_origin.png) 



Freshworks Q4 results (Freshworks Q4 earnings deck)





Freshworks' revenue grew 22% y/y to $165.1 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $160.2 million (+20% y/y) by a two-point margin. Worth noting as well is the fact that Freshworks didn't decelerate at all from Q3's 22% y/y growth pace (which had accelerated from 20% growth in the first half of FY24 in turn), making the company's guidance calling for an immediate declaration to 15-17% y/y growth in Q1 a bit implausible.

We like as well the fact that Freshworks' pace of new customer acquisition picked up slightly in Q4, where the company added 2.6k net-new customers and ended the quarter with over 72k total customers, up 8% y/y and a faster pace of growth versus ~5% y/y in the preceding three quarters of the year.

Freshworks customer trends (Freshworks Q4 earnings deck)





Where Freshworks is coming into a bit of difficulty, however, is net revenue retention rates, which dropped to 103% in the fourth quarter. In other words, Freshworks is having no problem signing up new customers, but the pace at which these customers are adding seats and upgrading their subscriptions is slowing down relative to the past.

 [![Freshworks net retention rates](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/33427965-1739474682928766.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/33427965-1739474682928766_origin.png) 



Freshworks net retention rates (Freshworks Q4 earnings deck)





There are two points to consider here, however. The first is that a strong dollar is weighing on Freshworks. If we adjust for constant currency, the company's net revenue retention rates in Q4 would be on par with ~105% in Q3 and ~106% in the first half of FY24. The second is that Freshworks' issue with weaker retention this year is hardly company-specific: many software companies, including and especially those that price their products on a per-usage basis instead of per seat, have struggled with this metric as well as companies slash their IT budgets and optimize their corporate headcount. We're hoping for a normalization in the IT environment, but we shouldn't drastically penalize Freshworks for a problem that is not unique or entirely related to the company's own execution.

In the meantime, we like the fact that the company's new customer acquisition is laying a strong foundation for future expansion, while we wait for the IT climate to normalize. The company noted that it has experienced better free-to-paid conversion rates in its core CX product, per CEO Dennis Woodside's remarks on the recent Q4 earnings call:

> Finally, I’ll cover CX, our flagship business that’s been paving a better way forward for service software for over a decade. This is another area where we see strong momentum, especially in the SMB segment and was a significant contributor to our net new customer adds this quarter.
> 
> We ended the quarter for CX with over 58,200 customers generating over $360 million in ARR, growing at 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, similar to the constant currency growth rate in Q3.
> 
> With an initiative that we started mid-Q3, we’re seeing ongoing conversion of free-to-paid customers, largely in the SMB segment. This initiative benefited the CX business and significantly contributed to the customer net adds for CX, which was more than 2,000 for the quarter. We are largely through the vast majority of conversions, so expect to see a smaller benefit in Q1."

On the profitability front, Freshworks' pro forma operating income nearly quadrupled to $40.3 million, representing a 20.7% pro forma operating margin and more than 13 points if y/y expansion versus merely a 7.2% pro forma operating margin in the year-ago Q4.

We don't expect Freshworks to maintain this status with some level of growth deceleration expected next year, but we note that the stock currently qualifies as a "Rule of 40" software company (22% revenue growth plus 20% operating margins), and a ~5x revenue multiple for a Rule of 40 contender is nearly unheard of in today's expensive stock market.

Key takeaways
-------------

The core reasons why investors seem to be souring on Freshworks (slippage in net revenue retention rates and expected deceleration in FY25) is a common theme across small/mid-cap software companies this earnings season, yet Freshworks stands out with its ~5x forward revenue multiple in an industry where peers trade closer to the high single digits or low teens. In my view, there's quite a big disconnect between Freshworks' stock and its fundamental reality: investors would be wise to take advantage now while the price is ripe.
