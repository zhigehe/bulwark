Earnings Call Insights: Crown Crafts, Inc. (NASDAQ:[CRWS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWS "Crown Crafts, Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Olivia Elliott highlighted the company’s ability to maintain cash flow and profitability despite ongoing economic challenges. A key development was the integration of the Baby Boom acquisition, contributing $3.8 million in sales during the quarter and introducing diaper bags as a new category.
* Elliott emphasized proactive cost management and product development efforts, stating, "We continue to refresh some of our categories and develop new products so that we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth."
* CFO Craig Demarest noted a decline in net sales to $23.3 million, citing lower online toy sales and the loss of a program at a major retailer in November 2023. Gross profit margins decreased to 26.1%, impacted by changes in product mix and higher warehouse lease costs.
* Demarest also reported a significant increase in borrowings to $20.9 million, primarily due to funding the Baby Boom acquisition.

### Outlook

* Elliott affirmed the company's focus on expanding top-line growth while maintaining cost discipline. She highlighted plans to refresh product lines, including diaper bags, and develop new products to complement existing categories.
* The company is monitoring potential impacts of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, with Elliott noting that suppliers are likely to help absorb the cost increase. Price adjustments to retailers may be minimal.
* The search for a new warehouse location has narrowed to two options, with a decision expected by mid-2025. Elliott stated that the West Coast location is slightly favored due to overall cost and logistics considerations.

### Financial Results

* Net income for the quarter was $893,000, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
* Marketing and administrative expenses rose to $4.4 million, driven by Baby Boom acquisition costs of $186,000. Interest expenses increased by $183,000 due to higher borrowings.
* Year-to-date cash flow from operations reached $7 million, compared to $4.1 million in the prior year. Inventory levels were reduced to $32.4 million, down from $34.9 million in December 2023, despite inventory additions from Baby Boom.

### Q&A

* Doug Ruth, Lenox Financial Services, asked about the decision-making process for the warehouse location. Elliott responded that cost, lead times, and freight logistics are key factors, with the West Coast option currently leading.
* Ruth inquired about updates in the diaper bag business. Elliott noted progress in securing new licensors and potential retailer placements, emphasizing refreshed designs and silhouettes. However, new placements are not expected until 2026.
* Ruth also asked about the Manhattan Toy holiday sales and Walmart placement. Elliott acknowledged disappointing holiday sales, attributing the decline to consumer trade-downs. However, she confirmed Walmart placements will be retained for another year.
* John Deysher, Pinnacle, asked about lease expirations and the timeline for the warehouse decision. Elliott confirmed the Eden Valley lease expires in June 2026, while the decision on the new warehouse location will likely be finalized by mid-2025.
* Deysher also raised concerns about the 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Elliott explained that initial supplier negotiations indicate price rollbacks may offset most of the tariff impact.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the company's ability to navigate economic challenges and capitalize on Baby Boom's contributions. Concerns were raised about declines in toy sales and tariff impacts.
* Management maintained a confident and forward-looking tone during prepared remarks. However, responses in the Q&A session reflected a more measured approach, particularly regarding tariffs and warehouse decisions. Statements like "We continue to evaluate our footprint" and "we are still assessing all options" showcased a careful and strategic mindset.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management appeared slightly more cautious in addressing cost pressures and sales challenges.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Net sales decreased from $24.5 million in Q2 2025 to $23.3 million in Q3 2025, driven by weaker online toy sales and the loss of a retailer bid program.
* Gross profit margins fell from 28.4% in Q2 to 26.1% in Q3, reflecting higher lease costs and product mix changes.
* Analysts in the current quarter focused more on operational efficiencies, such as warehouse consolidation and tariff management, while in the previous quarter, there was more optimism about Baby Boom's integration and holiday sales prospects.
* Management's tone shifted slightly from confident optimism in Q2 to a more cautious focus on mitigating risks and controlling costs in Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Tariffs on Chinese imports pose a risk to cost structures. Management is negotiating with suppliers to mitigate the impact.
* Declining toy sales, particularly in the Manhattan Toy brand, highlight potential challenges in consumer discretionary spending.
* Warehouse consolidation delays could increase costs and impact logistics.
* Higher borrowings following the Baby Boom acquisition elevate financial risks, though management plans to repay debt through operational cash flow.

### Final Takeaway

Crown Crafts continues to navigate economic challenges with a focus on integrating acquisitions, expanding product categories, and controlling costs. The addition of Baby Boom has bolstered sales, but declining toy sales and potential tariff impacts remain key concerns. The company is optimistic about its long-term prospects, supported by proactive cost management and strategic initiatives like warehouse optimization and product line refreshes.
