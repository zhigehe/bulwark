### Management View

* CEO Kati ter Horst emphasized the challenging geopolitical and economic conditions affecting the investment climate and stainless steel markets. The company maintained its leading market positions in Europe with a 31% market share and North America with 24%. Ferrochrome contributed 60% of the yearly results.
* The company achieved €101M EBITDA run-rate improvements in 2024, accumulating to €287M by year-end, and is on track to meet its €350M target by the end of 2025. Measures include centralizing advanced materials production in Germany and closing a coil service center in Hockenheim, delivering €50M savings.
* Short-term cost-saving actions of €50M for 2025 were announced, targeting procurement efficiency, operational improvements, and reduced discretionary spending. CapEx for 2025 is limited to €160M.
* CFO Marc-Simon Schaar reported a reduction in net debt to €189M with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.1. Liquidity reserves improved to €1.1B. He highlighted that ferrochrome operations benefited from low-emission production and strategic European positioning.

### Outlook

* Stainless steel deliveries in Q1 2025 are expected to increase by 10% to 20% compared to Q4 2024, although pressure on realized prices will persist. Maintenance costs are forecasted to decrease by €10M.
* A one-week strike in Finland during January is expected to reduce Q1 adjusted EBITDA by approximately €50M. Further strike-related risks could add €50M in negative impacts per additional week.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2025 is anticipated to be higher than Q4 2024, signaling early signs of market recovery.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 totaled €177M, with the ferrochrome business significantly stabilizing results. Group stainless steel deliveries decreased by 6% year-over-year, driven by an 11% drop in Europe, though deliveries in the Americas rose by 8%.
* Q4 2024 stainless steel deliveries decreased compared to Q3, with a 9% drop in Europe and 7% in the Americas. Prices declined in Europe but remained stable in the Americas.
* Maintenance costs and negative raw material impacts weighed on Q4 profitability, while the ferrochrome business area delivered improved results through cost optimization.

### Q&A

* Ioannis Masvoulas, Morgan Stanley: Questioned the decision to pause U.S. cold rolling expansion. CEO ter Horst explained the assessment concluded insufficient demand for additional capacity. She noted ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts in the Americas to add 80,000 tons of capacity without major investments.
* Tristan Gresser, BNP P. Exane: Asked about the impact of potential Mexico-U.S. tariffs. CEO ter Horst stated that such a scenario is unlikely and emphasized the strategic importance of the Mexican facility while highlighting alternative supply options if needed.
* Bastian Synagowitz, Deutsche Bank: Probed into volume guidance and potential pricing improvements. CFO Schaar indicated that replenishment activity rather than end-user demand drives volume recovery. He confirmed order books are showing positive signs.
* Anssi Raussi, SEB: Inquired about working capital and CapEx for Q1 2025. CFO Schaar expects working capital to increase in line with sales activities, while Q4 2024 CapEx was forecasted at €80M.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism but focused heavily on the U.S. and European market dynamics, tariffs, and volume recovery challenges. Questions revealed skepticism about margin sustainability and capital allocation priorities.
* Management displayed confidence in navigating market headwinds, emphasizing cost-saving measures and operational efficiencies. The tone during prepared remarks was positive but became more measured in Q&A, particularly on pricing and tariff-related topics.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 guidance shifted to highlight a focus on profitability and cost savings, contrasting with Q3’s emphasis on resilience amid market challenges.
* Analysts maintained concerns about the U.S. market, but discussions evolved to address broader trade and tariff implications.
* The tone of management’s comments shifted slightly as they acknowledged ongoing price pressures and external risks but highlighted structural cost-saving initiatives.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about tariff negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico and their implications for supply chains and margins.
* Management is mitigating risks through cost-saving actions, operational improvements, and strategic investments in energy-efficient production methods.
