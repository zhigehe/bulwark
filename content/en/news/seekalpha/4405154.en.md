The S&P500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews)) closed in the red on Friday, after investors digested another wave of corporate earnings report from major firms including Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")), Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) and Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")).

For the week, Nasdaq ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) gained 2%, while Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) rose 0.7%.

Wall Street had a slew of upgrades and downgrades from analysts. Here are some of the major calls for the week:

**AMD downgraded by Citi after Q4 results**

Citi [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403397-amd-tumbles-after-concerns-over-ai-revenue-growth-gets-rating-cut-at-citi) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:[AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) to Neutral from Buy, following the chipmaker’s fourth quarter results, wherein Data Center revenue missed expectations.

Citi analyst Christopher Danely said AMD reported decent results and that the company did not provide Al revenue [guidance](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403178-amd-reports-record-q4-revenue-continues-to-gain-market-share#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews "guidance"), and it appears AMD’s Al revenue is flat to down for the first half of 2025 with margin dilution. The brokerage cut PT to $110 from $170.

However, KeyBanc and Evercore reiterated their bullish rating on AMD.

**Skyworks downgraded as Apple plans to cut content demand for new iPhone**

Stifel [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404389-skyworks-solutions-sinks-as-apple-plans-to-cut-content-demand-for-new-iphone) Skyworks Solutions (SKWS) to Hold from Buy, after the company reported that its largest customer, Apple, plans to reduce its dependence on the company for its iPhone 17 model.

"iPhones represent ~85% of Apple-related revenue for SWKS, so this dynamic is expected to significantly impact F4Q (we forecast <$900mn in revenue vs. ~$1.05bn consensus prior to the print) and FY26 (we forecast $3.6bn-$3.7bn range vs. ~$3.99bn prior consensus)," said Stifel analyst Ruben Roy. The brokerage reduced PT by about 40% to $62 from $105.

B. Riley Securities also downgraded Skyworks to Neutral from Buy, while Mizuho downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform.

**Palantir receives praises from analysts after quarterly results**

Morgan Stanley [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402568-palantir-surges-over-20-after-q4-beat-outlook-keep-analysts-largely-bullish) Palantir (NASDAQ:[PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")) to Equal-weight from Underweight and increased PT to $95 from $60, after fourth quarter results and outlook beat expectations.

Analysts led by Sanjit Singh said as fundamentals are improving and the likelihood that this proves durable given the stronger 2025 outlook, their original downside catalysts are unlikely to materialize.

BofA also reiterated its Buy rating, while Jefferies maintained its Underperform rating but upped the price target to $60 from $28.

**Nike downgraded by Citi, Deckers receives upgrade**

Citi [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405087-citi-downgrades-nike-upgrades-deckers-disrupter-hoka-gains-momentum) Nike (NYSE:[NKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKE "NIKE, Inc.")) to Neutral from Buy, saying the sportswear giant’s turnaround plan will take even longer than anticipated as management acknowledged the competitive threat in running and challenges in earning back lost shelf space.

“We no longer have the patience or conviction to wait another year, especially with the stock trading at 39x our FY26EPS and 28x our FY26 EBITDA,” noted Paul Lejuez, lowering his FY26 EPS estimate by 24% to $1.84 based on weaker sales and gross margin.

Meanwhile, Lejuez upgraded Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:[DECK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DECK "Deckers Outdoor Corporation")), the parent company of footwear disrupter HOKA, to Buy from Neutral. The brokerage said the 25% selloff in shares after Q3 results is unwarranted and was largely driven by fears of slowing growth in its HOKA label, which Citi viewed as “misunderstood/unwarranted.”

**Regeneron upgraded by Leerink to Outperform**

Leerink Partners [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403603-regeneron-upgraded-leerink-following-recent-share-weakness " upgraded ") Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[REGN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REGN "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) to Outperform from Market Perform citing growth opportunities despite recent share weakness.

Analyst David Risinger projects that Eylea HD performance will improve in the second half of the year and uptake of Dupixent in COPD will help drive growth in 2025. The investment firm raised its price target to $834 from $762.

**Cirrus Logic raised by Benchmark on solid quarter**

Benchmark [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403742-cirrus-logic-rises-after-benchmark-upgrades-on-solid-q3-performance) Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:[CRUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRUS "Cirrus Logic, Inc.")) to Buy from Hold following the company's fiscal third-quarter 2025 results.

Analyst David Williams said they were upgrading the shares and setting a $125 price target after the company "turned in a solid" third-quarter performance, beating [revenue](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403053-cirrus-logic-non-gaap-eps-of-2_51-beats-by-0_47-revenue-of-555_74m-beats-by-45_44m#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews "revenue") and earnings by a wide margin, with a healthy upside to the fourth-quarter outlook.

Morgan Stanley reiterated **Nvidia** (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) as its [Top Pick](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404472-nvidia-rises-after-morgan-stanley-maintains-top-pick-tag-following-deepseek-impact), noting that DeepSeek ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) selloff is a buying opportunity. Analyst Joseph Moore said that sentiment has worsened around potential longer-term risks, but near-term business continues to be firm.

BofA [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404494-stmicroelectronics-cut-to-neutral-as-bofa-prefers-infineon) **STMicroelectronics** (NYSE:[STM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STM "STMicroelectronics N.V.")) to Neutral from Buy, citing relative preference for Infineon Technologies ([OTCQX:IFNNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IFNNY "Infineon Technologies AG")). The analysts think STMicroelectronics' shares could benefit from a cyclical improvement in the second half of 2025 but believe that investors will prefer to leverage it via Infineon — due to its AI server power management and Automotive microcontroller units market share gains.

Jefferies [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403522-cardinal-health-raised-to-buy-by-jefferies) **Cardinal Health** (NYSE:[CAH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAH "Cardinal Health, Inc.")) to buy from hold, citing management's "impressive" EPS track record. Jefferies raised its price target for the stock to $150 from $140.
