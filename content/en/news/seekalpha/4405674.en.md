Earnings adjusted for one-time items were $1.83 a share, beating the $1.58 that Wall Street analysts on average had forecast.

Sales fell 8.4% from a year earlier to $1.88 billion, matching the consensus estimate. Rockwell (NYSE:[ROK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK "Rockwell Automation, Inc.")) said the decrease was due to unfavorable currency translation and a 7.6% decline in organic sales.

### Capex uncertainties

The company's Intelligent Devices unit reported a 13% decline in sales to $806 million, while the Software & Control division experienced a 12% drop to $529 million.

Partly offsetting the declines was a 5% gain in Rockwell’s ([ROK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK "Rockwell Automation, Inc.")) Lifecycle Services segment to $546 million.

Chief Executive Blake Moret said uncertainty in macroeconomic trends and government policy keeps weighing on the capital expenditure plans of businesses. Amid these doubts, Rockwell ([ROK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK "Rockwell Automation, Inc.")) won multimillion-dollar orders during the quarter, specifically in the U.S., he said.

"From a demand perspective, we are encouraged by better-than-expected order performance in the quarter with sequential growth across all regions and business segments," Moret said.

### Management guidance

For its fiscal 2025, Rockwell repeated its adjusted earnings outlook of $8.60 to $9.80 a share, while cutting midpoint of its sales forecast to $8.1 billion from $8.2 billion. Analysts forecast adjusted earnings of $9.26 a share on revenue of $8.12 billion.
