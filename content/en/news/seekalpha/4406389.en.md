First Solar (NASDAQ:[FSLR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR "First Solar, Inc.")) -0.7% in Tuesday's trading despite receiving an upgrade at Mizuho to Outperform from Neutral with a $259 price target, hiked from $218, citing a materially improved sales outlook after 2026 and a stronger competitive position in the U.S. market.

Mizuho analyst Maheep Mandloi touts First Solar's (NASDAQ:[FSLR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR "First Solar, Inc.")) TOPCon technology patents that give the company an edge over competitors who are relegated to using older and less efficient PERC cells.

First Solar ([FSLR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLR "First Solar, Inc.")) shares likely have underperformed YTD given negative sentiment around 45X manufacturing tax credits surviving the Trump administration but, even in a base case assuming 45X expires after 2026, Mandloi thinks any negative impact on the company could be mitigated by tariffs, leading to better negotiating power in 2027.

Also, while competitors could develop solar supply chains in regions currently not subject to tariffs, this would "take time and could come under Trump tariffs in the future," Mandloi writes.
