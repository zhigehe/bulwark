Earnings Call Insights: DaVita Inc. (NYSE:[DVA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DVA "DaVita Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Javier Rodriguez highlighted DaVita's 25th anniversary and emphasized its transformation into a comprehensive kidney care company. Significant progress was noted in expanding home dialysis access, with over 80% of home patients using connected cyclers for remote monitoring. The company also expanded its international presence and value-based care model through Integrated Kidney Care (IKC).
* DaVita achieved full-year 2024 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS growth of 21% and 26%, respectively, despite challenges such as healthcare outages and supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Helene. Rodriguez noted, "Our strategy remains focused on improving health outcomes, minimizing avoidable medical expenses, and pursuing the right growth opportunities."
* CFO Joel Ackerman reported Q4 adjusted operating income at $491 million and adjusted EPS at $2.24. Free cash flow for Q4 was $281 million, bringing the full-year figure to $1.16 billion.

### Outlook

* For 2025, DaVita provided adjusted operating income guidance of $2.01 billion to $2.16 billion, representing 5.2% midpoint year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS guidance was set at $10.20 to $11.30, with a midpoint growth of 11% compared to 2024.
* Revenue per treatment is expected to grow 4.5% to 5.5% in 2025, driven by rate increases, collection improvements, and reimbursement from oral phosphate binder inclusion in the Medicare bundle.
* Patient care costs per treatment are anticipated to rise 6% to 7%, largely influenced by phosphate binders and inflationary pressures on labor and other costs.
* Free cash flow guidance for 2025 is $1 billion to $1.25 billion.
* DaVita expects treatment volume growth to be flat year-over-year in 2025, influenced by prior disruptions in peritoneal dialysis ([PD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PD "PagerDuty, Inc.")) patient starts and fewer treatment days.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 U.S. treatment volume increased by 30 basis points year-over-year, but treatments per day declined by 80 basis points.
* Revenue per treatment climbed sequentially by $1, contributing to a full-year increase of 3.7% over 2023.
* Patient care costs per treatment rose $7 sequentially, driven by seasonal factors and higher center closure costs.
* Adjusted international operating income declined by $17 million, primarily due to a $19 million reserve against aged accounts receivable in Brazil, though underlying international operations remained solid.

### Q&A

* Joanna Gajuk, Bank of America: Questioned volume outlook and its impact on operating income. CFO Ackerman clarified, "The variability in admissions, mortality, and mistreatment rates creates a range for operating income, with the midpoint assuming flat treatment volume growth in 2025."
* AJ Rice, UBS: Asked about patient care cost growth outside of phosphate binders. Ackerman noted a 3.75% anticipated growth in historical costs, primarily from labor and other expenses.
* Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank: Inquired about the impact of PD supply normalization on new starts. Rodriguez stated, "We have resumed admitting patients at historical rates, but the impact of lost patients in Q4 will reduce volume growth in 2025 by 15 to 20 basis points."
* Justin Lake, Wolfe Research: Asked about share repurchase plans. Ackerman responded that DaVita will prioritize capital-efficient growth and maintain leverage within the 3 to 3.5 range, with the remaining capital allocated for repurchases.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts displayed skepticism regarding volume growth and the financial impact of elevated patient care costs. Questions highlighted concerns about mortality trends, phosphate binder reimbursement, and the impact of prior supply disruptions.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing resilience and operational efficiencies. Rodriguez expressed confidence in achieving double-digit EPS growth through disciplined capital allocation.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, with a focus on operational stability despite challenges, while analysts continued to probe uncertainties around volume trends and cost pressures.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance shifted from discussions about hurricane-related disruptions in Q3 to a more comprehensive outlook for 2025, including specific targets for adjusted operating income and EPS growth.
* Revenue per treatment continued its upward trajectory, though volume growth expectations were revised down to flat for 2025, compared to 50 basis points to 100 basis points projected in Q3.
* Analysts' focus on phosphate binders and cost dynamics persisted in both quarters, but Q4 discussions included more detailed projections for 2025.

### Risks and Concerns

* Elevated mortality and mistreatment rates remain ongoing challenges, with potential impacts on treatment volume growth in 2025.
* Supply chain disruptions, particularly in peritoneal dialysis solutions, continue to weigh on patient admissions and operational efficiency.
* Cost pressures driven by labor inflation and the inclusion of oral phosphate binders in the Medicare bundle are expected to increase patient care costs.
* Uncertainty around the reimbursement rates and patient adherence for phosphate binders may affect financial outcomes in 2025.

### Final Takeaway

DaVita concluded 2024 with strong financial performance despite operational hurdles, achieving double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and EPS. Looking forward, the company projects 5.2% midpoint growth in adjusted operating income for 2025, supported by improved revenue per treatment and disciplined cost management. However, challenges such as elevated mortality rates, supply chain disruptions, and cost pressures from phosphate binders remain key risks to monitor.
