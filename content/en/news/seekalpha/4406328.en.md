Peloton’s (NASDAQ:[PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc.")) new CEO, increased interest in fitness equipment, and cost-savings measures should contribute to a narrower loss in FY25, leading Argus analyst John Staszak to upgrade the stock to Buy from Hold with a $15 price target, translating into 75% upside from Monday’s closing price.

“Given his background in the health & fitness industry, we think that Peloton’s new CEO, Peter Stern, can reduce debt, revive subscriber growth, and increase customer retention,” Staszak said in Tuesday’s research note.

Staszak’s upgrade comes in the wake of last week’s [fiscal Q2 results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404453-peloton-shares-race-higher-improved-fy25-outlook#scroll_comments "fiscal Q2 results") which underscored Peloton’s (NASDAQ:[PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc.")) struggle to obtain additional connected fitness subscribers, leading revenue to erode by 9% year-over-year. Shares were launched higher, however, as the company raised its adjusted EBITDA outlook on further cost-cutting that will align its expenses with its competitors and hiked its free cash flow target to at least $200M.

The combination of cost-cutting and raised EBITDA led Staszak to narrow his FY25 loss estimate to $0.40 from $0.45 and FY26 loss estimate to $0.25 from $0.30 per share.

Over the past year, Peloton (NASDAQ:[PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc.")) shares have nearly doubled as investors bet that new leadership and new products will revive the brand to its COVID-era glory.

“The question now for investors is, does the recent rally already use up all of Peloton’s steam, or are there further gains ahead,” Seeking Alpha author [Gary Alexander](https://seekingalpha.com/author/gary-alexander " Gary Alexander ") asks.

“While I remain quite cautious on Peloton’s prospects going forward, I also no longer think there is that much downside risk left in the stock,” Alexander adds. Like Staszak, Alexander is also bullish on Peloton’s improving gross margins and free cash flow. But Alexander adds that its Peloton's ([PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc.")) iconic brand that will allow for the company to “maintain an upscale, aspirational brand that is synonymous with both health and affluence.”

Wall Street analysts and Seeking Alpha authors like Alexander all view Peloton ([PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc.")) as a Hold, while Seeking Alpha’s Quant rating gives PTON a Strong Buy with a 4.57 Quant rating out of 5.
