Way back in August of 2023, one company that I decided to [downgrade](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4628737-escalade-time-to-step-back) was **Escalade** (NASDAQ:[ESCA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESCA "Escalade, Incorporated")). From the time I had previously published about it in November of 2022 until the time I decided to downgrade it, the S&P 500 had risen by only 10%. But over that same window of time, Escalade had skyrocketed by 67.6%. Having said that, a combination of factors justified a downgrade from the ‘buy’ I had it at to a ‘hold.’ For starters, the firm's fundamental condition was showing signs of weakness. But in addition to that, the stock had become priced at a level that no longer justified optimism.

Unfortunately, things haven't gone exactly according to plan. You see, whenever I rate a company a ‘hold,’ it is my belief that the shares will likely perform more or less along the lines of the broader market for the foreseeable future. Since the downgrade, the S&P 500 has skyrocketed by 35.9%. By comparison, Escalade is actually down 2.3%. This is because of a worsening of its fundamental condition and because shares, while far from expensive, aren't the cheapest. After looking at the business once again, I don't think a further downgrade is appropriate. However, if we continue to see signs of weakness moving forward, that could be in the cards.

Recent results have been weak
-----------------------------

According to the management team at Escalade, the company plays in the sporting goods industry. It has been operating in that space for nearly 100 years. Based out of Indiana, the business produces, imports, and distributes, a wide array of products. Examples here include archery products, table tennis, basketball goals, pickleball products, fitness products, some safety products, hockey and soccer tables, billiard tables and accessories, darting products, outdoor games, and more. For anybody who likes to live an active lifestyle, this is certainly one of the companies worth being aware of.

As much as I hate to say this, the fundamental performance of Escalade has been weak for quite some time now. During the [2023 fiscal year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/33488/000143774924010066/0001437749-24-010066-index.htm), for instance, revenue for the business came in at $263.6 million. That represents a decline of 16% compared to the $313.8 million reported one year earlier. This drop in sales was driven by a plunge in consumer demand caused by broader economic conditions that include inflation, worries about a recession, rising interest rates, a high cost of living, and more. Even though there was a spike in demand for these types of products during the COVID-19 pandemic, management did say that the subsequent decline still has revenue coming in above pre-pandemic levels. But even so, this drop is concerning.

With the decline in revenue has come a drop in profits as well. Net income was cut by almost half, from $18 million to $9.8 million. Surprisingly, the company's gross profit margin remained almost flat year over year. However, selling, general, and administrative costs rose from 14.3% of sales to 15.7%. In cases where a low margin business experiences a material drop in revenue, it is common for these kinds of costs to remain sticky. Unfortunately, this also reflected negatively when it comes to most other profitability metrics. The one exception was operating cash flow, which shot up from $8.6 million to $48.3 million. But if we adjust for changes in working capital, we get a decline from $25.9 million to $17 million. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the business fell from $32.5 million to $23.5 million.

For the 2024 fiscal year, we only have data through the [third quarter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/33488/000143774924031986/0001437749-24-031986-index.htm). For the first nine months, management reported revenue of $187.6 million. This is a drop of 5.3% compared to the $198.1 million reported the previous window of time. Management attributed this drop to weak consumer demand for the same reasons I specified already, and to channel destocking from its customers. It is noteworthy that there were some areas of growth, specifically when it came to table tennis, basketball, and archery. But outside of that, it was weakness pretty much across the board.

For the bottom line, we have seen some more mixed results that should cause some degree of optimism. Net income, for instance, grew from $7 million to $10.3 million. Management attributed this improvement to better fixed cost absorption. It also seems as though the firm is benefiting from strategic cost reduction initiatives. One example would be the closure and sale of its operations in Mexico. Unfortunately, selling, general, and administrative costs, still rose year over year, climbing from 15.7% of sales to 17.3%. But again, this is something that will remain sticky for the foreseeable future. Other profitability metrics ended up being somewhat mixed. Operating cash flow fell from $27.7 million to $23.8 million. On an adjusted basis, we get a pullback from $13.3 million to $13.1 million. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the company grew from $17.1 million to $20.2 million.

We don't really know what to expect for the final quarter of the year. We also don't yet have a date for management as to when results for that time will be reported. But if we annualize the results we have seen so far for 2024, we would get adjusted operating cash flow of $16.7 million and EBITDA of $27.8 million. If we use these estimates, as well as the historical results for the 2023 fiscal year, we can see in the chart above how the stock is currently priced. On an EV to EBITDA basis, using the 2024 figures, shares actually do look fairly attractively priced. But when it comes to the other readings, this is what I would expect of a company in the fair value range. It would be one thing if financial performance was coming in strong. That might justify more optimism and flexibility in terms of rating the company. But with sales still dropping bottom line results mixed, a neutral stance is the best I can do.

| **Company** | **Price / Operating Cash Flow** | **EV / EBITDA** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Escalade** | **12.7** | **8.7** |
| **Topgolf Callaway Brands ([MODG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MODG "Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp."))** | **3.1** | **5.7** |
| **Sturm, Ruger & Co. ([RGR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGR "Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc."))** | **11.9** | **8.9** |
| **Johnson Outdoors ([JOUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JOUT "Johnson Outdoors Inc."))** | **7.9** | **31.8** |
| **Latham Group ([SWIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWIM "Latham Group, Inc."))** | **9.2** | **15.0** |
| **American Outdoor Brands ([AOUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AOUT "American Outdoor Brands, Inc."))** | **14.3** | **30.9** |

Speaking of mixed, we get the same thing when comparing the company to similar firms. In the table above, I stacked Escalade up against five similar companies. Admittedly, some of these trading multiples are wildly different from others. On a price to operating cash flow basis, I found that four of the five companies ended up being cheaper than our candidate is. However, on an EV to EBITDA basis, only one of the five companies was cheaper than it is.

Takeaway
--------

As you can see here, Escalade isn't a great candidate. I would say it's also not a horrible one. However, as a value oriented investor, my goal is to find the best of the best opportunities and to focus on those firms that still look cheap even after accounting for a sufficient margin of safety. I just don't see that here. Given recent financial performance and how the stock is valued, I believe that maintaining a ‘hold’ rating really is the best I can do. However, if we do continue to see weakness moving forward, a downgrade might eventually be in store.
