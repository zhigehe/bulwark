Earnings Call Insights: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:[RPD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPD "Rapid7, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Corey Thomas, CEO, highlighted Rapid7’s Q4 2024 ARR at $840 million, reflecting 4% growth year-over-year and in line with expectations. The detection and response (D&R) business, generating over $400 million in ARR, grew in the mid-teens and remains a critical growth driver.
* The company emphasized the performance of its Exposure Command platform within the risk and exposure management segment, which contributed to over 20% year-over-year growth in pipeline generation during Q4. This product aims to integrate various security functions and provide consolidated attack surface visibility.
* Rapid7 made investments in establishing a new SOC and innovation center in India to scale threat detection capabilities and support its managed detection and response (MDR) offerings.
* Tim Adams, CFO, noted, "Rapid7 ended the year with solid double-digit growth momentum in our detection and response business and with promising early traction and efforts to stabilize and accelerate growth in risk and exposure management."

### Outlook

* Rapid7 projects ARR growth of 4%-6% for 2025, with D&R expected to drive the majority of the growth. The company is also targeting $860 million to $870 million in total revenue for 2025, representing 2%-3% growth.
* Q1 2025 revenue is forecasted at $207 million to $209 million, with non-GAAP net income per share ranging between $0.33 and $0.36.
* The company shared plans to reinvest up to $30 million in strategic initiatives, including MDR service expansion, advancing the Exposure Command platform, and operational improvements through the India innovation center.

### Financial Results

* Total Q4 revenue reached $216 million, up 5% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of guidance. Recurring product revenue grew 6% to $206 million, while professional services declined by 5%.
* Free cash flow for 2024 was $154 million, representing an 18% margin, an improvement of over 800 basis points year-over-year.
* Adjusted net income per share for Q4 2024 was $0.48, and Rapid7 ended the year with $559 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

### Q&A

* Saket Kalia, Barclays, asked about the remaining ARR mix outside of D&R and its growth projections. Corey Thomas explained the remainder includes cloud security and legacy products and highlighted the early traction in exposure management but noted these contributions are considered upside to the current plan.
* Patrick Coleville, Scotiabank, inquired about factors contributing to expected net new ARR growth in the second half of 2025. Corey Thomas attributed this to strong pipeline momentum in D&R and Exposure Command, supported by a more robust product suite.
* Hamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley, questioned churn in the VM segment. Corey Thomas clarified that retention rates are stabilizing, with upgrades to Exposure Command expected to improve customer stickiness.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about elongated deal cycles, particularly for larger deals, and sought clarity on the stability of retention rates in the VM business. Questions reflected a cautious tone regarding the company's ability to reaccelerate growth amid competitive pressures.
* Management showed confidence in the D&R business and pipeline growth driven by the Exposure Command platform. Corey Thomas used phrases like "we feel really good about the stability" and emphasized early traction in key growth areas.
* Compared to the prior quarter, management maintained a consistent tone of measured optimism while signaling a cautious approach to incorporating new contributions into guidance.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Rapid7's ARR growth decelerated from 6% in Q3 2024 to 4% in Q4 2024. However, the D&R business continued to demonstrate robust performance with mid-teens growth.
* The prior quarter emphasized foundational improvements and partner ecosystem expansion, while the current quarter focused on operational investments and product traction within risk and exposure management.
* Analysts' questions this quarter showed heightened focus on competitive dynamics and deal cycle elongation, a shift from Q3’s emphasis on pipeline recovery.

### Risks and Concerns

* Elongated deal cycles, particularly for larger deals, pose risks to ARR growth. Management attributed these delays to budget scrutiny and broader macroeconomic uncertainty.
* The vulnerability management segment faces secular pressures, with competitive dynamics and customer transitions to cloud environments impacting growth.
* Analysts highlighted potential risks tied to federal funding uncertainties affecting state, local, and healthcare customers.

### Final Takeaway

Rapid7 closed 2024 with stable ARR growth, driven by the strong performance of its D&R business and promising early traction in exposure management through the Exposure Command platform. Looking ahead, the company aims for 4%-6% ARR growth in 2025, supported by targeted investments in MDR expansion and operational efficiencies. While elongated deal cycles and competitive pressures remain challenges, Rapid7's strategic focus on integrated security solutions and partner ecosystem growth positions it for long-term market opportunities.
