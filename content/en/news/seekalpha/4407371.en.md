Earnings Call Insights: Aytu BioPharma (NASDAQ:[AYTU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AYTU "Aytu BioPharma, Inc.")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* CEO Josh Disbrow reported that both the ADHD and pediatric portfolios achieved sequential prescription growth for the first time since late 2022. ADHD net revenue reached $13.8 million, while the pediatric portfolio delivered an 86% sequential increase in net revenue, achieving a $10 million annualized run rate.
* Disbrow highlighted ongoing corporate optimization initiatives expected to generate $2 million in annual cost savings. This follows significant prior reductions, including a $31 million annualized decrease in SG&A expenses over the past two years.
* The Aytu RxConnect platform was emphasized as a key differentiator, ensuring predictable pricing for patients and broadening payer access. Disbrow stated, "For us, success is winning for prescribers, for patients and for pharmacies alike."
* CFO Ryan Selhorn noted, "These strategic changes allowed us to generate positive adjusted EBITDA and keep our cash levels steady," and highlighted a 37% reduction in G&A expenses and a 47% reduction in sales and marketing costs since fiscal 2023.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated a focus on achieving positive cash flow and continued organic growth in ADHD and pediatric portfolios. Disbrow also pointed to opportunities in inorganic growth, targeting "smallish tuck-in assets" that align with the company’s infrastructure and RxConnect platform.
* Expanded payer coverage, including new Medicaid plans across multiple states, will support sustained momentum in the pediatric portfolio. Disbrow noted that the antihistamine franchise reached its highest prescription levels since Q2 2024.
* Disbrow expressed optimism in achieving $16-$17 million in quarterly ADHD revenue, supported by market growth and share gains.

### Financial Results

* Q2 2025 net revenue was $16.2 million, including $13.8 million from the ADHD portfolio and $2.4 million from the pediatric portfolio. Gross margin for the quarter was 66%, impacted by higher-cost inventory from the transition to contract manufacturing.
* Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 million, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Net income was $0.8 million, boosted by a $3 million derivative warrant liability gain.
* Cash and cash equivalents stood at $20.4 million as of December 31, 2024, slightly up from $20.1 million at the end of September.

### Q&A

* **Naz Rahman, Maxim Group:** Asked about the pathway for ADHD revenue to reach $16-$17 million quarterly. Disbrow responded, "We absolutely anticipate growth... confident about that and equally confident about the pediatric products continuing to grow."
* **Rahman:** Inquired about one-time effects in pediatric portfolio growth. Disbrow confirmed there were none, attributing growth to initiatives such as expanded coverage and increased prescriber diversity, particularly in the antihistamine franchise.
* **Rahman:** Asked about dynamics of Medicaid coverage expansion. Disbrow explained that the company has achieved broad-based coverage across multiple states, with healthy margins and reduced reliance on any single payer.
* **Rahman:** Sought clarification on the $2 million cost savings. Selhorn explained these savings stem from G&A headcount reductions and streamlined contracted services, expected to begin materializing in Q3 2025.
* **Rahman:** Asked about business development. Disbrow highlighted active discussions for in-licensing and acquisitions, targeting commercial-stage assets in CNS/psychiatry and pediatrics, with a preference for minimal upfront costs.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts focused on ADHD revenue stabilization, pediatric growth drivers, and cost optimization, reflecting a slightly positive tone. Rahman expressed interest in long-term revenue targets and Medicaid coverage dynamics.

* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts showed increased optimism about the company’s ability to sustain growth, while management displayed greater confidence in execution and business development initiatives.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language remained consistent, with an emphasis on cash flow positivity and portfolio growth. New Medicaid coverage expansions were highlighted in Q2.
* ADHD portfolio net revenue showed sequential improvement on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the prior quarter's one-time payer resolution. Pediatric revenue accelerated significantly, contrasting with Q1’s modest rebound.
* Analyst sentiment shifted slightly positively, reflecting confidence in growth initiatives, while management’s tone became more optimistic about pediatric recovery and potential acquisitions.
* Strategic focus evolved to include leveraging RxConnect for both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged gross margin noise due to higher-cost inventory from the Grand Prairie facility, expected to normalize by Q1 2026.
* Analysts raised questions about sustaining pediatric growth and ADHD revenue stabilization amidst market normalization.
* Disbrow addressed these risks by emphasizing diversified payer coverage, improved sales force alignment, and targeted marketing strategies to drive momentum.
