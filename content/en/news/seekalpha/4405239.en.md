* Safe Superintelligence, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, is in talks to raise funding that would value it at $20B, Reuters reported.
* The company, which has not yet generated any revenue, has talked to both existing and new investors on the funding, the news outlet [added](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-ssi-talks-be-valued-20-bln-sources-say-2025-02-07/ "added"), citing sources familiar with the matter. The talks are believed to be in the early stages and terms, along with the exact amount of funding, may change.
* Investors in the previous round included venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global and SV Angel.
* Safe Superintelligence raised $1B in funding in September 2024 that valued the company at $5B. Based in Palo Alto, Calif. and Tel Aviv, its goal is to create artificial intelligence systems that top human capabilities, also known as general AI.
* Sutskever left OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")), in June. He was a part of the company's board of directors that [fired](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4038344-openais-sam-altman-ousted-as-board-lacks-confidence-says-he-lacked-candor "fired") Chief Executive Sam Altman in November 2023. Altman eventually returned to the company, and Sutskever stepped down from OpenAI's board of directors.
