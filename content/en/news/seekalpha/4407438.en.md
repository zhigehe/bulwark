* Nestlé S.A. [press release](https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/full-year-results-2024) ([OTCPK:NSRGY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY "Nestlé S.A.")): FY Non-GAAP EPS of CHF 4.77.
* Revenue of CHF 91.35B (-1.8% Y/Y).
* Organic growth was 2.2%, with a return to positive real internal growth of 0.8%, and both strengthened in the second half.
* Free cash flow improved to CHF 10.7 billion, and the Board proposes an increase in the dividend per share to CHF 3.05.
* "From 2025, we expect our actions to drive an improvement in organic sales growth, with a lower underlying trading operating profit margin in the short term as we invest for growth. While there is macroeconomic uncertainty, we have lots of opportunities ahead of us, and we have the strategy, the resources and the people and team to deliver."
* **2025 outlook unchanged**
  + Guidance in line with previous outlook, as accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsets recent increases in key commodity prices.
  + Organic sales growth expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year as we continue to deliver on our growth plans.
  + UTOP margin expected to be at or above 16.0% as we invest for growth.
  + Guidance assumes no significant change in key macroeconomic variables.
