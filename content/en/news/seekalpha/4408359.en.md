### Management View

* Palomar delivered a strong fourth quarter with 23% gross written premium growth, 48% adjusted net income growth, and an adjusted return on equity of 23%. CEO Mac Armstrong highlighted the company’s achievement of its Palomar 2X target of doubling 2021 adjusted underwriting income in just three years.
* The acquisition of First Indemnity of America (FIA) was completed at the start of 2025, integrating surety into Palomar's portfolio as a long-term growth driver. Significant new hires, including a Chief Claims Officer and leadership for crop and casualty businesses, were emphasized as key contributors to scaling operations.
* CFO Chris Uchida reported adjusted net income of $41.3 million for the quarter, and net earned premiums rose to $144.9 million, reflecting improved reinsurance terms and growth in lower-ceding products like earthquake insurance.

### Outlook

* Palomar provided full-year 2025 adjusted net income guidance ranging from $180 million to $192 million, with an implied adjusted ROE of 23% at the midpoint. This forecast assumes a reinsurance treaty renewal at flat to a 5% reduction in pricing.
* The crop business is projected to exceed $200 million in premiums for 2025, with the company retaining 30% of the subject matter premium compared to 5% previously. Management highlighted plans to position the crop segment among the top 10 U.S. crop premium writers by the end of the year.
