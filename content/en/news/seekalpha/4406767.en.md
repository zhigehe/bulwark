Shares of AnaptysBio (NASDAQ:[ANAB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANAB "AnaptysBio, Inc.")) climbed ~12% in the premarket on Wednesday after the biotech said its lead asset, rosnilimab, reached the main goals in a mid-stage trial targeted at the autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis.

Citing 12-week data from its global Phase 2b RENOIR trial for moderate-to-severe RA, the San Diego, California-based biotech said rosnilimab achieved primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance.

As for the primary goal, all three doses of the antibody therapy succeeded against placebo in terms of a 12-week change of a clinical measure called the disease activity scoreâ€”28 joints (DAS-28) C-Reactive Protein.

The 424-patient trial also indicated a well-tolerated safety profile for the experimental therapy, the company said, adding that the incidences of adverse events were similar across the on-drug [and off-drug arms.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999624-anaptys-announces-rosnilimab-achieved-positive-results-in-ra-phase-2b-trial-and-highest-ever)

AnaptysBio (NASDAQ:[ANAB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANAB "AnaptysBio, Inc.")) expects to share 28-week data from the study in Q2 2025 and post a topline readout from a mid-stage trial for rosnilimab in ulcerative colitis in Q4 2025, a faster timeline than its previous projection [for a Q1 2026 readout.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19904771-anaptys-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-update#hasComeFromMpArticle=false)
