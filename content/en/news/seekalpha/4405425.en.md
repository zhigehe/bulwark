President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports on Monday, according to media reports.

Trump made the remarks to reporters traveling on Air Force One, the reports said.

The tariffs would apply to all countries, he reportedly said, but didn't specify when those levies would take effect. 

Trump added that he would announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, which would take effect almost immediately.
