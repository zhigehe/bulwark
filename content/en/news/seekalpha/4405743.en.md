Oneok (NYSE:[OKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE "ONEOK, Inc.")) +3.9% in Monday's trading as Wolfe Research upgrades shares to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $110 price target, saying the stock has fallen out of favor on near-term Bakken headwinds and its valuation has quickly shifted to a big discount to large-cap peers, creating an attractive entry point. 

While EnLink slightly reduced the quality mix of Oneok's (NYSE:[OKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE "ONEOK, Inc.")) portfolio, Wolfe's Keith Stanley says the stock's discount is undeserved, as the acquisitions comprise only ~20% of Oneok's total EBITDA and should not drive such a meaningful change in valuation.

Also, near-term concerns around wildfires and cold weather in the Bakken should have been priced in to the stock, while the company typically guides conservatively such that initial 2025 EBITDA guidance likely will be below consensus, the analyst says.

Stanley says Oneok ([OKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE "ONEOK, Inc.")) should be poised for a "buy the news" event with management able to focus on EnLink synergies in its first earnings call since closing the full transaction, and opportunities tied to the exciting [new joint venture export project with MPLX](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402646-oneok-mplx-form-joint-ventures-to-build-gulf-coast-lpg-export-terminal "new joint venture export project with MPLX").

The analyst believes Oneok's ([OKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE "ONEOK, Inc.")) can grow competitively with peers from high returning projects and tailwinds from merger synergies, while differentiating itself with sector-leading excess free cash flow of ~$2B/year through 2027, which can be applied to rapidly rising return of capital through buybacks and debt paydown, as well as providing plenty of excess capacity to fund incremental growth or M&A.
