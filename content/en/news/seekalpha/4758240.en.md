Delta Air Lines (NYSE:[DAL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DAL "Delta Air Lines, Inc.")) investors had a good 2024 as the Atlanta-based megacarrier continued to lead the global airline industry in total revenues and market cap. Among U.S. airlines, it continues to generate the most profits. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future success. The airline industry is mature and requires both high labor and capex inputs in order to be sustainable.

There has been much written about the dividing line that has formed in the U.S. airline industry between a trio of legacy airlines – DAL, United ([UAL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UAL "United Airlines Holdings, Inc.")) and Alaska ([ALK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALK "Alaska Air Group, Inc.")) - and much of the rest of the industry including the low cost and ultra low cost airlines which are struggling to deliver services which customers are willing to buy at costs which the airlines can afford.

DAL FY2024 earnings summary (ir.delta.com)





Building on 15 years of rethinking its business
-----------------------------------------------

Delta’s current position of leadership of industry leadership is a result of its transformation that started 20 years ago with its chapter 11 filing in the wake of 9/11. Emerging faster and less expensively than United, Delta was the first to kick off the megamerger cycle by choosing Northwest Airlines as its merger partner over 15 years ago. The merger provided Delta with an opportunity to redefine major components of its business including its network, fleet, finances, and most importantly its service levels. Despite being mature, at least from a growth perspective, the airline industry continues to be highly competitive and the positioning of carriers within the industry – both domestically and internationally – continues to change. No airline can be certain of its success.

With 2025 now well underway, it is timely to look at the factors that have driven Delta’s growth and profitability over the past decade and identify changes that will impact future results.

Delta leads the industry in network balance
-------------------------------------------

Airlines are inherently tied to the markets which they serve. Aircraft are mobile factories and can be used anywhere the airline is legally permitted to fly. U.S. airline networks have evolved considerably since 2010 and the megamerger cycle. For Delta, it moved fairly quickly to close Cincinnati as a hub. Delta designated CVG as its Midwest hub in the late 1980s to compliment DAL’s historically strong presence along the southern tier of states. At about the same time, DAL also closed its hub at Memphis – MEM, inherited from Northwest. DAL’s CVG and MEM hubs were heavily dependent on regional jets. Northwest was the largest airline at both Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul and DAL rebuilt its Midwest network around those two hubs. While Memphis allowed DAL to better serve markets in the central U.S., Delta was able to consolidate its presence in the southern U.S. to Atlanta where it continues to operate the world’s largest hub.

Even before its chapter 11 filing and its merger with Northwest, Delta closed its hub at Dallas/Ft. Worth where it remained a distant number two to American Airlines. Delta used its closure of DFW, CVG and MEM to build NYC, first at JFK airport where it has grown to become the largest carrier, and then later at LaGuardia, where it orchestrated a slot swap involving Washington National with US Airways to become the largest airline at LGA. Despite all of these moves, DAL remains the 2nd largest airline at DFW and Washington National on top of its leading position in NYC where DAL operates 15% more flights at all three NYC airports than second place United, although the two carry about the same number of passengers due to the perimeter restrictions at LaGuardia which limit the ability to fly to the western U.S.

As Delta’s position in NYC and its four interior U.S. hubs were solidified, Delta has shifted its focus to building coastal hubs over the past decade. Delta built a hub at Seattle as a replacement for its transpacific hub at Tokyo Narita and then opened Boston as a hub where it has become the largest carrier, overtaking JetBlue ([JBLU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JBLU "JetBlue Airways Corporation")) which seized Delta and US Airways’ pulldowns of their Boston operations post 9/11. During the pandemic, Delta overtook American as the largest carrier at Los Angeles. Over the past 15 years, Delta has become the largest airline in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles and the second largest airline at Seattle behind hometown Alaska Airlines ([ALK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALK "Alaska Air Group, Inc.")).

[![DAL global network](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/7197781-17394723906708918.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/7197781-17394723906708918_origin.png)



DAL global network (ir.delta.com)





From a network perspective, it is valid to ask where Delta goes – and grows – from its 8 hub city/9 hub airport network. Delta has said that its coastal network growth, which was heavily accelerated during covid and the post covid recovery, will slow, in part because of slot or facility constraints. DAL has said that its growth in 2025 will be focused on restoring capacity to its four interior U.S. hubs, predominantly by reinstating regional jet flights that have not operated for a number of years. Delta contracts with three regional carriers, including its wholly owned subsidiary Endeavor, to operate approximately 300 two class regional jets (those which have first class cabins in addition to coach). In the aftermath of the pandemic, thousands of pilots were needed to restart airline operations due to pilot retirements. Regional jet operators raised salaries to try to retain pilots, but were still unable to staff their operations. Delta estimated during the worst of the post-covid staffing crisis that over one-third of its regional carrier capacity was not being fully used. Delta expects to be able to fully staff its regional carrier operations by the end of 2025. Although Delta uses regional jets to fly some non-hub routes, much of the capacity that is re-added will be to increase connectivity across its network. While Delta currently flies the most capacity on its mainline (large jet) aircraft among U.S. airlines and serves the most domestic cities with mainline aircraft, restoring of dozens of regional aircraft’s worth of capacity should allow Delta to compete even more effectively in many small and medium-sized cities across the country that are dependent on whole or in part on regional jets for their air service.

Southwest’s further reduction of service at Atlanta strengthens Delta’s dominance of one of the U.S.’ largest local markets. Although Spirit acquired some of the gates that LUV gave up, Spirit’s own current chapter 11 restructuring makes it most likely that it will look for revenue opportunities where other carriers are not as strong. Spirit has a major presence at Detroit.

Since Delta has committed to growing its network at the rate of GDP, it isn’t clear where Delta will grow beyond 2025. DAL is expected to restore its hubs to pre-covid levels of capacity or slightly higher. Given that it is the largest airline at all four of its interior U.S. hubs, there is little incentive to add more capacity than the local markets and whatever connecting capacity DAL wants to carry via its hubs. Growth at its coastal hubs is much more constrained by infrastructure. DAL said pre-covid that it would develop a focus city at Austin, Texas – AUS - and has slowly grown there. However, LUV is the largest carrier at AUS and has been for years. AAL moved a number of regional jets from its northern hubs to AUS but not only violated its pilot agreement for the percentage of regional jet capacity at the airport but also cannibalized traffic from its massive DFW hub just a few hundred miles away. DAL is now operating more flights at AUS than AAL and may be guessing that LUV’s limited growth capacity and focus on improving its margins will allow DAL to continue to grow at AUS where the city plans to build an all-new concourse which will double the amount of gates at the crowded airport which has been at the epicenter of Texas growth. Delta is expected to sign a contract that will more than triple the number of gates it uses at Austin and gain incremental additional gates until the new concourse opens in five years.

In addition to AUS, Delta has the potential to add more non-hub domestic routes as well as to grow its presence in Asia where it has been slow to restore capacity that it lost with the closure of its Narita hub as well as to India, which Delta previously served. Delta’s international partners, including with Korean Airlines and startup carrier Riyadh Air in Saudi Arabia, will provide DAL with more than enough cities to which it can add service.

US airline passenger demand (Airlines for America)





Matching the best aircraft to each flight
-----------------------------------------

As a result of its restructuring of its network in the early years of its merger, Delta led the industry in replacing regional jets including by the addition of Boeing ([BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA "The Boeing Company")) 717s and later Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")) A220s, both of which are small mainline aircraft. Delta is the only one of the airlines that use regional jets to add small mainline aircraft. The combination of small mainline aircraft, including the A220 which is powered by fuel-efficient new generation engines, plus the only fleet of exclusively two-cabin regional jets among the big three will allow Delta to expand its presence in small and medium-sized markets.

Delta’s ability to grow its presence in medium and small cities is particularly important given that American has built its domestic network strategy around connecting small and medium-sized cities even as it has reduced its presence in major coastal markets like NYC and Los Angeles. While American has large hubs at Charlotte and Dallas/Ft. Worth that facilitate frequent service to scores of cities, Delta’s operation of more hubs means that some of its connecting potential was eroded as flights to some of those hubs did not operate. Now, Delta should be well-positioned to compete not just in large cities where it does well but also in small and medium sized cities where it has lost some market share over the past three years. American and Delta generate comparable levels of domestic revenue but it is likely that Delta’s domestic revenue gain in 2025 will be greater than American’s.

In contrast, United is the largest U.S. international airline and Delta expects its growth over the next few years to be more heavily skewed to international markets. Delta’s ability to support its international growth will come from a larger and deeper domestic network. While each of the big three have robust networks, Delta is likely to maintain the best balance between domestic and international networks. While international networks have historically had much higher volatility in revenue and profits compared to the domestic system, international travel is strong and expected to remain so, allowing Delta to use its dominance in the domestic market to grow its presence in international markets. Schedule data shows that Delta is growing its capacity more than AAL, LUV or UAL in the first quarter.

Delta’s complex fleet is being renewed faster than competitors
--------------------------------------------------------------

If airlines are defined by their networks, then the ability to serve those networks comes down to the fleets they employ to serve those networks. While Delta just 20 years ago was one of Boeing’s largest customers, Delta has bought the majority of its new aircraft – including all of its widebody aircraft – from Airbus over the past 15 years. Airbus has delivered aircraft much closer to on-time than Boeing, which has faced lengthy and ongoing delays with all of its aircraft programs. Delta is also one of the few airlines in the world that is buying aircraft from all of Airbus’ model lines, and has just become the largest operator of Airbus widebodies in the world. Delta has the Boeing 737 MAX 10 on order and expects to receive the first of its 100 aircraft order in 2026, a year later than originally planned.

Delta’s fleet fuel efficiency is more than 5% better than AAL and UAL’s, reducing DAL’s fuel bill by $1 billion per year compared to AAL and UAL’s. DAL was an early adopter of increasing the average aircraft size of its domestic fleet, which leads to both labor and fuel efficiencies.

Although Delta is taking delivery of about 50 aircraft per year, about 5% of the total size of its nearly 1000 aircraft mainline fleet, it used more than half of its new deliveries to retire older aircraft in 2024 and is expected to do the same in 2025. Thus, Delta will not only restrain its capacity growth but will gain valuable operating cost efficiencies.

[![DAL fleet 31Dec2024](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/7197781-17394726632589228.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/7197781-17394726632589228_origin.png)



DAL fleet 31Dec2024 (ir.delta.com)





Delta intends to reduce its fleet complexity but uses its diverse fleet by tailoring its fleet to the mission with newer generation, fuel efficient fleet being more widely used on longer routes where fuel efficiency matters the most. Older generation aircraft like the 717 and 757 are used on shorter routes, esp. from Atlanta, where both aircraft carry large numbers of passengers on the short flights within the eastern U.S. Delta also uses its fleet complexity to sell maintenance services to other airlines. It has obtained N. American airline exclusive contracts with General Electric ([GE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE "General Electric Company")), Pratt and Whitney ([RTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX "RTX Corporation")) and Rolls-Royce ([OTCPK:RYCEY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYCEY "Rolls-Royce Holdings plc")) to overhaul most of the new generation engines that power modern airlines. Post-covid production shortages of many aircraft components has slowed the growth of Delta’s maintenance revenues, but the company expects to generate $5 billion in revenues within the next decade at margins that exceed transportation revenues.

One of Delta’s unique strategies was to buy a refinery outside Philadelphia and tune it for maximum jet fuel production; the Trainer refinery supplies much of Delta’s fuel needs in the Northeast and it trades non-jet fuel products for jet fuel in other parts of the country, allowing the refinery to directly or indirectly provide more than half of Delta’s fuel needs. The refinery has saved DAL more than a couple billion dollars on its fuel bill with significant savings coming in the post-covid era when global refinery production and fuel demand was mismatched, creating high crack fuel spreads, or the premium that refiners receive for creating a barrel of refined product. Pre-covid, Delta attempted to sell parts of the refinery’s operations but did not want to lose the cost reduction component that the refinery provides, even if only at limited times. Compared to its U.S. carrier peers, Delta paid eight cents/gallon less than United in 2024, three cents/gallon less than American, and nine cents/gallon less than Southwest ([LUV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUV "Southwest Airlines Co.")). While Southwest hedges fuel for cost planning purposes, AAL and UAL do not hedge fuel. Given that the big 3 burn more than 4 billion gallons of jet fuel per year, roughly twice what LUV burns, every penny saved matters.

Growing Cargo and Ancillary Revenues
------------------------------------

Part of Delta’s focus on fleet renewal, esp. in international markets, is to increase its cargo revenues where it trails United by hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Delta’s fleet of Airbus A350s is expected to reach 40 aircraft in 2024 and Delta will deploy the model, the largest new generation aircraft type in the U.S. airline fleet to all six continents in order to grow cargo revenues. In 2026, Delta will take delivery of the first of its order of 20 A350-1000s, the larger model in the aircraft family, giving DAL the longest range and most fuel-efficient aircraft among U.S. airlines which should not only allow DAL to substantially grow cargo revenues but also expand its network to further cities including to Asia where strong cargo demand continues for passenger airlines.

Industry-leading service and loyalty monetization
-------------------------------------------------

Delta has long had a reputation for offering some of the best service among U.S. airlines. The U.S. Dept. of Transportation collects large amounts of data from airlines and publishes it, although often with significant reporting delays. Private sector data can be used to replicate some of the metrics the DOT measures. The Wall Street Journal announced its 2024 industry rankings just three weeks into 2025, giving the first-place ranking to DAL, just above LUV. DAL is investing in its passenger experience with the largest fleet of free, high-speed WiFi – currently on over 650 domestic aircraft, but that number of aircraft is expected to double in 2025 with its international and regional jet fleets. Delta opened its first Delta One lounge at JFK airport to strong reviews and plans for its premium business class lounge network to reach five clubs in the next year, with all eight international hubs expected to have Delta One lounges in the next few years.

Delta’s relationship with American Express ([AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP "American Express Company")) is one of the biggest drivers of DAL’s profitability. The DAL-AXP relationship delivers $7 billion in revenue to the airline, the largest airline cobrand arrangement in the world. DAL expects the relationship to grow to $10 billion in the latter half of this decade.

Strengthening Balance Sheet
---------------------------

Delta’s financial positioning is a marriage of its operating income performance and its balance sheet strength. DAL remains one of only a couple of U.S. airlines that has an investment grade credit rating. DAL’s capex is moderate given that the potential spending the airline could do. Delta has managed to target capex at about half of its cash generation levels, so has been able to continue to reduce its debt. It is nearing the end of a cycle of extensive terminal renovations, so its debt service costs will continue to decline as it pays down debt that was used to sustain the operation during covid.

US industry balance sheet quality (Airlines for America)





Labor cost leadership
---------------------

The covid era resulted in the departure of hundreds of thousands of airline employees. Some airlines, including Delta, offered generous buyout packages so that they could replace higher cost workers with younger, lower cost employees when demand returned. As previously noted, airlines that were heavily dependent on regional carrier operations as well as lower cost carriers were most impact as salaries grew during the covid recovery period. Delta led the industry in raising salaries not just for its unionized pilots but also for the remainder of its workforce which is largely non-union in an industry that is heavily unionized. The amount of labor cost increases has pressured finances of many airlines but esp. those that are not generating the kinds of revenue that DAL does. Southwest, which has long had above average employee relations, has raised pay of all of its employee groups while American signed a contract with its flight attendants in 2024 but has yet to settle a post-covid contract with many of its airport-based ground employees. United has yet to settle with its flight attendants and also has tens of thousands of airport ground employees that will see their pay hiked when contracts are settled. Thus, DAL’s labor costs relative to its peers are expected to be stable while some competitors, including UAL will pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in retroactive pay on top of hundreds of millions of dollars in increased ongoing labor costs.

Macroeconomic factors
---------------------

Even though DAL is running one of the best businesses in the airline industry, many investors continue to view airlines negatively. Nonetheless, several airlines, including DAL, outperformed market indices in 2024. While that level of share price improvement might not be repeated in 2025, industry competitive dynamics favor DAL as one of the best performing airline stocks.

Airlines are becoming less sensitive to economic shocks, including by catering to higher income individuals that are less sensitive to fast-acting economic challenges. Airlines including DAL called out overcapacity in the post-covid era that was harming yields, and the industry acted faster to pull back capacity in late 2024 than has been seen in airline cycles. Much of the excess capacity was added by lower cost carriers that are trying to improve their unit cost performance but yet they have not been able to generate sufficient revenues. Industry capacity dynamics led to stronger financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 and that trend is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2025. International travel demand is now being spread across much more of the year and DAL is adding more capacity than competitors and maintaining its position in top summer travel markets in Southern Europe including Italy. DAL was the first U.S. carrier to announce restoration of service to Israel. Greater fuel efficiency helps to minimize the swings as oil prices fluctuate but there remains a strong correlation between airline stock performance and oil prices.
