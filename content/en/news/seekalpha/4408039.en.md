### Management View

* CEO Rob Fauber emphasized Moody’s record 2024 performance, achieving a 20% revenue increase to over $7 billion and a 26% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. He highlighted robust growth across both Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) and Moody’s Analytics ([MA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA "Mastercard Incorporated")), driven by strategic investments and favorable market conditions.
* MIS delivered 18% revenue growth in Q4 2024, supported by a 29% rise in transactional revenues. Moody’s rated $6.2 trillion in issuance for 2024, up 42% from the prior year, with margins reaching 60%.
* MA achieved 10% recurring revenue growth in Q4, led by Decision Solutions with $1.4 billion in ARR, growing at 12%. CEO Fauber noted investments in GenAI, platform modernization, and expanded product offerings, including acquisitions such as Numerated, Praedicat, and CAPE Analytics.
* CFO Noémie Heuland commented, "Q4 adjusted diluted EPS was $2.62, up 20% year-over-year," while revenues grew 13% to nearly $1.7 billion.

### Outlook

* Moody’s provided 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $14 to $14.50, supported by high single-digit revenue growth and a 200 basis-point margin expansion to 50%.
* MIS is expected to achieve mid to high single-digit revenue growth, driven by low single-digit issuance growth and favorable issuance mix. Margins for MIS are projected to expand to 62%-63%.
* MA revenue is anticipated to grow in the high single digits, with ARR growth expected in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Margins are forecasted to expand to 32%-33%.
* The company announced an efficiency program targeting $250 million-$300 million in annual savings over two years, with $200 million-$250 million in restructuring charges, primarily focused on personnel-related costs.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenues reached $1.7 billion, reflecting 13% growth. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.62, up 20% year-over-year.
* MIS generated $809 million in Q4 revenue, driven by 134% leverage loan issuance growth and strong performance in U.S. CLOs and CMBS. MIS transactional revenue grew 27%.
* MA reported $863 million in Q4 revenue, with 95% of its total derived from recurring revenue, which grew 10%. Insurance ARR rose 12% due to strong demand for catastrophe modeling tools, while KYC ARR increased 17%, supported by new customer sales.

### Q&A

* Manav Patnaik, Barclays: Asked whether medium-term guidance for MA was organic. CFO Heuland confirmed 9%-10% ARR growth is largely organic, with a reduced contribution from M&A due to higher interest rates.
* Ashish Sabadra, RBC Capital Markets: Queried MIS margin potential. CFO Heuland highlighted continued investments in rating workflows and automation while noting tailwinds from rebased incentive compensation.
* Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley: Inquired about MA margins and efficiency plans. CFO Heuland and Steve Tulenko discussed cost-saving opportunities from GenAI and organizational simplifications, particularly in engineering and customer success.
* Alex Kramm, UBS: Asked about 2025 MIS revenue drivers. CEO Fauber cited assumptions for modest issuance growth, a 50% increase in M&A activity, and strong investor demand.
* Owen Lau, Oppenheimer: Focused on private credit opportunities. CEO Fauber emphasized Moody’s leadership in BDC ratings and fund finance, noting the critical role of independent credit assessments in the growing private credit ecosystem.
