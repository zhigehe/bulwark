Wall Street's focus on Wednesday was on the January U.S. consumer inflation report, in which both the headline number and the core figure came in higher than expectations.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, both the headline consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI [accelerated](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi "accelerated") in January, the former to +0.5% M/M and the latter to +0.4% M/M. Those were the highest M/M readings since March 2024. 

On a Y/Y basis, headline CPI increased 3.0% in January versus a consensus of +2.9%. Core CPI climbed 3.3%, compared to the estimate of +3.1%.

See below for various reactions to the CPI report:

**[Damir Tokic](https://seekingalpha.com/author/damir-tokic), Seeking Alpha analyst since 2013**:

"Hot CPI inflation report. Energy costs are not providing disinflationary effect anymore, rather adding to the inflationary pressures, shelter inflation is not falling as expected keeping the core CPI sticky, as well as the transportation costs. Most importantly these numbers still don't reflect the new policies (tariffs, immigration). Thus, the Fed will have to start thinking about hiking, and obviously this is a major negative for the stock market."

**Michael Kramer, founder of** [**Mott Capital Management**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management) **and investing group leader of Reading The Markets**:

"CPI and core CPI were surprisingly high, with both coming in hotter than expected. It serves as further evidence that the Fed is done cutting rates and, based on Treasury forwards, the chances for the Fed having to hike again are back on the table."

**[John Bowman](https://seekingalpha.com/author/john-bowman "John Bowman"), Seeking Alpha analyst since 2023**:

"CPI came in above expectations, which is especially concerning given we have been on an upward trend since October. The particular culprits seem to be food and shelter, both of which were excessively high on the report."

**Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US LLP**:

"U.S. January CPI: This data is sure to create a migraine for policymakers, the public, Powell and the Fed. It's not just the 15.2% increase in eggs. It's turn of the year price increases-prescription drug prices jumped 4.1% & childcare and nursery school costs jumped 7%.

These are the bête noire of the public and policymakers and are the seeds in which short-term disturbances turn into long-term inflation expectations. And that is how we get sustained increases in the price level across the economy and inflation."

**Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at The Budget Lab at Yale**:

"Bad news and good news in the CPI report.

First the bad news. Groceries up 0.5% MM and 1.9% YY. Not surprisingly, a big driver was eggs, which grew 15% MM alone. Daily commodity data suggest egg prices haven't peaked since January, either.

Now the good news. We've had a recent bout of hot January CPIs so there's a good chance that some of these drivers are just strange seasonal issues that will go away later in the year. The really good news continues to be housing. CPI housing (rent & OER) came in at 0.32% MM, just a hair away from its 0.28% 2019 average."

**Alberto Gallo, chief investment officer at Andromeda Capital Management**:

"The inflation genie is out of the box. Last year's Fed emergency cut was a policy mistake. A return of goods inflation with tariffs and fiscal spending should be the number one risk on the monetary policy agenda right now. Financial conditions are loose, not restrictive."

**Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management**:

"Markets seeing the beginning of trumpflation. Tariffs add to inflation as well as soaring egg costs. No reason to think rates are going lower anytime soon. Already hearing retailers talking about adjusting prices for new tariff costs."
