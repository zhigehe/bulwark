The latest [jobs report](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405109-nonfarm-payrolls-climbs-less-than-expected-in-january-unemployment-unexpectedly-dips "jobs report"), released earlier on Friday, was "consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating," said Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler.

On the other side of the Fed's dual mandate, while inflation has significantly come off its mid-2022 peak, "recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated," Kugler said in remarks prepared for delivery at an Economic Club of Miami event.

Like many of her colleagues, Kugler stressed the Fed's wait-and-see approach to interest rates, noting the monetary authority will "continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."

Also stoking her cautious stance on monetary policy, she [said](https://app.piqsuite.com/reuters/feds-kugler-says-labor-market-healthy-inflation-elevated-2025-02-07-17-02-53 "said"), there is "considerable uncertainty" about how President Donald Trump's proposed policies would impact the U.S. economy.

Looking ahead, though, economic growth is expected to stay on a solid footing in Q1 2025, the Fed governor said.
