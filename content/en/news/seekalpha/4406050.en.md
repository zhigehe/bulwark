BYD Company Limited ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) ([OTCPK:BYDDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDY "BYD Company Limited")) shook up the electric vehicle sector on Tuesday by announcing new advanced driver-assistance features across most of its lineup for no extra cost.

The electric vehicle giant announced at an event on Monday evening in Shenzhen that it will make its God’s Eye driver-assistance system standard in vehicles priced from 100,000 yuan ($13,700) and include it in several lower-cost models such as the popular Seagull hatchback.

The God's Eye system comes in three variants. The God's Eye A (DiPilot 600) is considered the most advanced version, featuring three LiDAR sensors. It will be used in BYD's luxury Yangwang brand vehicles. God's Eye B (DiPilot 300) is a mid-tier system with one LiDAR unit, intended for the semi-premium Denza brand and flagship BYD vehicles. God's Eye C (DiPilot 100) is the entry-level version, utilizing 12 cameras and 12 ultrasonic radar sensors. Th system will be fitted to more affordable models, including the Seagull.

In a broad view, BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said the industry is entering an era where autonomous driving is for everyone.

The BYD development could pose a significant challenge to the market position in China of EV companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")), NIO (NYSE:[NIO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIO "NIO Inc.")), Li Auto ([LI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LI "Li Auto Inc.")), and XPeng ([XPEV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XPEV "XPeng Inc.")).

BYD Company ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) ([OTCPK:BYDDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDY "BYD Company Limited")) hit a record high in Hong Kong, but traded lower on Tuesday in the U.S. amid the latest tariff and trade war developments.
