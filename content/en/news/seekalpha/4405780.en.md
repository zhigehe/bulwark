The marketing chief of Sonos (NASDAQ:[SONO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SONO "Sonos, Inc.")), Jordan Saxemard, is leaving the company effective immediately, according to a report from *The Verge* Monday.

The departure was announced during an internal call, the report said. Lindsay Whitworth, who has been at the company for over 20 years, will assume the role of chief marketing officer on an interim basis.

“Sonos head of marketing Jordan Saxemard has departed Sonos effective immediately. We thank him for his contributions to the company. Lindsay Whitworth, Vice President of Global Consumer Direct, will lead the marketing team in the interim. A search for a new marketing leader is underway,” a Sonos spokesperson said in a statement to *The Verge*.

Last month, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin left the company, immediately a day after the wireless sound system solutions company announced the departure of CEO Patrick Spence.

The senior-level exits come after failure to improve the customer experience for the company's products and delays for new ones. Back in August, while still CEO, Spence admitted that his hastiness to redesign the company's app fell short of the mark.
