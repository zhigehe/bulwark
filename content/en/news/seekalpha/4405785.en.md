Meta (NASDAQ:[META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) shares continued gains for 15 straight sessions, as the stock closed 0.36% higher at $717.12 on Monday.

The company gained about 16.60% in the preceding 15 sessions. The stock jumped more than 52% in the last one year, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which rose over 20% during the same period.

META is up 16.30% over the past one month. The stock closed 0.36% higher on Friday at $714.52.

The company plans to invest about [$65 billion](https://www.cdomagazine.tech/aiml/meta-plans-to-invest-up-to-65-bn-in-ai-infra-in-2025#:~:text=our%20Privacy%20Policy.-,Meta%20Plans%20to%20Invest%20Up%20to%20%2465%20Bn%20in%20AI,Representative%20image%20by%20freepik.&text=Meta%20Platforms%20has%20announced%20plans,Google%20in%20the%20AI%20race.) in artificial intelligence this year, which is way above its $38-$40 billion spent last year and even above analysts' estimated $50.25 billion.

“This heavy investment signifies the management's commitment to adopting the recent technology to enhance its user experience and improve its efficiency,” [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756603-meta-platforms-ticks-all-the-right-boxes-strong-buy "said") Seeking Alpha analyst HedgeMix.

Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth has told staff that the company [plans](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401933-metas-tech-chief-bosworth-says-planning-half-a-dozen-more-ai-wearables-report) to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearable devices this year, *Business Insider reported last week*, citing an internal memo from November.

However, Seeking Alpha analysts are also bullish and see the stock as a [Buy.](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/ratings/author-ratings "Buy.")
