Earnings Call Insights: IREN Limited (NASDAQ:[IREN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IREN "IREN Limited")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* Co-CEO Daniel Roberts highlighted the company’s record net profit after tax of $18.9 million for Q2, driven by low-cost Bitcoin production and rapid operational growth. He emphasized the ramp-up to 50 exahash by mid-2025, supported by the recently achieved 31 exahash capacity at the end of the quarter.
* Roberts announced the Horizon 1 project, a 75-megawatt liquid-cooled AI data center in Childress, targeting completion in the second half of 2025. This initiative aims to address a shortage of such facilities and support high-density computing needs, including NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs.
* A new 600-megawatt Sweetwater 2 development was introduced, expanding the West Texas data center hub to 2 gigawatts by 2028, pending grid connection agreements.
* CFO Belinda Nucifora reported Bitcoin mining revenue of $113.5 million and operating cash flows of $53.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $62.6 million, supported by an average realized Bitcoin price of $84,300 and improved electricity costs due to a spot pricing strategy.
* Nucifora noted that net electricity costs per Bitcoin mined decreased to $21,400, reflecting operational efficiencies.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its target to reach 50 exahash by mid-2025, with a revised final goal of 52 exahash following allocation adjustments to support Horizon 1.
* Roberts stated the company’s focus on developing the Sweetwater 2 project, aiming to finalize grid connection agreements and energize by 2028, while emphasizing the strategic importance of the West Texas data center hub.
