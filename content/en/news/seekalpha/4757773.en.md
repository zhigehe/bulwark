**Cabot Corporation** (NYSE:[CBT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBT "Cabot Corporation")) recently [posted](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9523418) its Q1 2025 report, and it outperforms its sector’s performance. CBT unlocks a positive recovery outlook and additionally provides investors both growth and income opportunity, making it a good buy candidate.

Company Overview
----------------

Cabot Corporation is one of the leading manufacturers of specialty chemicals globally. They are well known for their reinforcing carbons, specialty carbons and compounds, battery materials and inkjet colorants. Additionally, their products are widely used in automotive, construction and industrial and consumer products. The company remains innovative and in fact, they recently received an award for their [sustainable reinforcing carbon products](https://investor.cabot-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cabot-corporation-receives-clepa-innovation-award-2024). They are also continuously expanding their production capacity in both of their operating segments, supporting the continued recovery of the company’s total revenue growth.

CBT operates under two operating segments; its Reinforcement Materials and its Performance Chemicals. The Reinforcement Materials segment posted a slower trailing revenue of $2,580 million, down from $2,610 million recorded in FY 2024 but remains high as compared to its FY 2023 of $2,563 million. According to the management, they experienced less favorable pricing and product mix reflecting a decline of revenue to $611 million in Q4 2024, down from $641 million recorded from the same period last year. However, EBIT remains growing as they see volume improvement in their Asia Pacific and EMEA region. Their trailing segment’s EBIT amounted to $538 million, up from $537 million recorded in FY 2024 and both FY 2023 and FY 2022 amounting to $482 million and 408 million, respectively. This shows impressive growth in its segment’s trailing EBIT margin of 20.85%, up from 20.57% recorded in FY 2024 and its FY 2022 of 15.26%.

The management expects further improvement of this trend as they are expecting the completion of their capacity expansion in their Cilegon Plant, located in Indonesia, bringing additional volume contributing to successfully materialize their $1 billion adjusted EBITDA target in FY 2027.

Cabot is looking to improve its battery materials product portfolio globally. In fact, it is continuing to allocate more budget in the US region, as shown in the image below. This reflects a strong commitment to improve its supply chain, positioning the company well for the growing demand for [battery materials](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/battery-2030-resilient-sustainable-and-circular).

This expansion catalyst will help its Performance Chemicals segment to continue growing in the future. CBT's segment’s trailing revenue amounting to $1,276 million remains up from FY 2024 of $1,250 million and its $1,225 million recorded in FY 2023 but remains below its $1,388 million in FY 2022. This segment also shows an improving EBIT margin, as shown in its trailing EBIT margin of 13.71%, up from 13.12% recorded in FY 2024, and up from 10.20% recorded in FY 2023, but below its 16.86% recorded in FY 2022. As quoted below, management sees volume recovery in its key end markets, driving an improvement in its margin.

> If you sort of boil it all up for Performance Chemicals, we're expecting good solid growth rates in the sort of mid-single digits, maybe a little higher across the whole basket of applications for the fiscal year, but with some differences depending on applications.

Overall, CBT’s growth remains stronger than its sector as shown in its revenue YoY growth of 1.71%, up from its sector’s median of [-0.47%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBT/growth) and EBIT YoY growth of 17.21%, up from its sector’s median of 1.48%.

Improving EPS and Cash Flow
---------------------------

One of the value-adding catalysts of CBT is its growing EPS despite today's challenging demand environment. Unlike its disrupted revenue growth, CBT’s EPS remains growing as shown in the image below.

This is thanks to its improving trailing operating margin of 16.21%, up from its 5-year average of 12.11%. On top of this, management is consistently buying back their own shares then retiring those stocks. This brings down the stock's total shares outstanding to 54.2 million from 56.8 million in FY 2021 and from 62.6 million in FY 2025. This trend will continue as they have a new share repurchase program authorizing them to buy [up to 10 million shares](https://investor.cabot-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cabot-corp-board-increases-share-repurchase-authorization-10) in the future.

Additionally, CBT has a growing cash flow from operations amounting to $711 million, up from $692 million recorded in FY 2024 and up from $257 million recorded in FY 2021. On top of its growing EBITDA target in FY 2027, another value-adding catalyst for CBT is that management provided a growing discretionary free cash flow of more than [$500 million](https://investor.cabot-corp.com/static-files/db940306-a5d4-44a4-9a92-6f19c7417ccd) in FY 2027. This implies that the company will remain liquid, despite its CAPEX plan, and that it has enough cash to push through its aggressive share buyback plan while having enough to pay dividends to its investors.

Attractively Valued
-------------------

CBT is undervalued relative to its peers, as can be seen in the image above. Analysts are expecting a forward P/E of 9.42x, which appears to be relatively discounted as compared to its sector’s median of 15.63x and its peer, [AVNT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVNT "Avient Corporation")’s, of 15.62x. Its estimated forward EV/EBITDA of 7x also showed attractive discounts as compared to its peers’ median of 9.01x.

My conservative price target for CBT is $110. This is derived from a 3-year DCF model. My assumption includes: revenue growing to [$4.44 billion](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBT/earnings/estimates) in FY 2027, aligned with analyst estimates, and it remains conservative considering the estimated growth of the [Global Reinforcement Materials market](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/reinforcement-materials-market) and strong tailwind from the [EV battery market](https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/lithium-ion-battery-separator-market). I assumed a continued improvement on its EBIT margin to 17.42% or an EBIT amounting to $777 million in FY 2027. Additionally, this growth shows only a 7.35% 3-year CAGR. I used a Depreciation and Amortization expense ratio of 4.3%. This brings estimated EBITDA of $967.9 million in FY 2027, aligned with management’s long-term target. I also used a CAPEX ratio of 7.0% to reflect its growing CAPEX plan. Additionally, I used a net working capital ratio of 18.2%, effective tax rate of 27%, discount rate of 10% and conservative EBITDA exit multiple of 8.5x.

From these inputs, we can arrive at an estimated enterprise value of $7,122 million. I then applied net debt of $1,015 million, long-term investment of $13 million and other liabilities amounting to $149 million to arrive at a fair value of common equity of $5,971 million. Finally, I used CBT's current shares outstanding of 54.2 million to arrive at a conservative $110 price target. This reflects a ~22% margin of safety, as of this writing.

Risk Note
---------

Although CBT shows some resilience with its growing EPS, the new tariff policy of Trump’s administration could adversely affect its demand environment. While the company can transfer the burden of enhanced tariff cost to its customers, they expect that these new policies could potentially impact their overall demand levels. This is especially true since the majority (81%) of their revenue is derived outside the US. In fact, 24% of its total revenue sources from China. The question is: how material will the effect of such policy be on their overall operation? The management sees minimal effect as they have immaterial volume imported to the US from their China production facilities. The management also sees minimal impact on their Mexico and Canada operations, as quoted below.

> For Mexico, where we operate one Reinforcement Materials plant, we expect a minimal direct impact on our production in Mexico, as it is primarily sold into the Mexican market. For Canada, we operate two plants that manufacture products for our reinforcing carbons, specialty carbons, and specialty compounds product lines. A large portion of the production at these plants is sold in Canada, but also there is production sold to customers in the US. Carbon black products that we produce in Canada and sell into the US, represents approximately 10% of the carbon black we sell in North America.

If the management reveals that they are incorrect about their initial assessment regarding the minimal impact of the new tariff policy, these could negatively impact their operating margin and post additional challenges to fully materialize their long-term target of their adjusted EPS growing between 7% and 10% 3-year CAGR.

Trading At a Logical Support Zone
---------------------------------

[![CBT: Trading near Its support](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/saupload_b08f85e037791c3de316279621fe38a2_thumb1.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/saupload_b08f85e037791c3de316279621fe38a2.png)

CBT is currently trading near its $83 support level. Sentiment from its moving averages remains bearish. However, this bearish sentiment is being challenged by its MACD bullish crossover, as demonstrated in the chart above. Looking at its short-term price action, a break above $92 will signal that the bulls are back in play. For now, CBT offers good upside potential and a break below $83 will further improve the current risk reward ratio.

Conclusive Thoughts
-------------------

CBT has been in the market for over 140 years, and they recently showed resilience in growing their margin. This correction unlocks a better opportunity to grab the stock at a better price. CBT remains liquid and offers a [growing dividend](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBT/dividends/scorecard) today, with a forward yield of 2%. The reward from its strong share buyback program, growing cash flow and strong operating capacity expansion outweigh the risk of potential EPS growth disruption. Hence, CBT is a good stock to buy.
