TotalEnergies (NYSE:[TTE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTE "TotalEnergies SE")) CEO Patrick Pouyanné said a [long-term deal](https://www.ft.com/content/50eb389a-fc0a-4178-a543-d2971b3757fc "long-term deal") with the U.S. is necessary to guarantee Europe's energy security, as an agreement that secured a more favorable licensing regime for European companies would satisfy Trump's desire for the bloc to buy more U.S. oil  
and gas, while protecting Europe from future price increases, *Financial Times* reported Sunday.

Pouyanné, whose company is Europe's biggest exporter of energy from the U.S., said such a long-term deal would guarantee security of supply from the U.S. and help wean Europe off Russian gas.

The CEO also said Europe should seek “a form of guarantee” to ensure U.S. liquefied natural gas supply could not be disrupted, and he was concerned that without such guarantees, higher gas prices could lead to the U.S. limiting exports of its LNG.

"Trump wants to sell more energy to Europe, LNG in particular, [and] Total is one of the main players," Pouyanné said. "I'm ready to bring more energy to Europe."

The CEO also criticized Europe's environment, social and governance rules, describing the European Union's corporate sustainability reporting directive, which threatens companies with fines for not ensuring their supply chains do not harm workers or the environment, as a "monster" formed from "good intentions."

But TotalEnergies (NYSE:[TTE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTE "TotalEnergies SE")) is involved in several U.S. LNG projects including a 15M metric tons/year project in Louisiana and an initial 17.5M tons/year project in south Texas, and Pouyanné said the company would not rush into more U.S. projects despite Trump's election.
