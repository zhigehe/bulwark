American Express (NYSE:[AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP "American Express Company")) stock slid 2.7% in Monday morning trading after the credit card company's chief financial officer said he expects the company's Q1 revenue growth will slow from Q4 2024's 9% pace.

Still, CFO Christophe Le Caillec said at an investor conference he's confident with AmEx's (NYSE:[AXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP "American Express Company")) full-year revenue guidance. Last month, the company [introduced 2025 revenue growth](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398308-american-express-q4-earnings-slightly-beat-2025-guidance-slightly-soft-as-expenses-rise " introduced 2025 revenue growth ") guidance of 8%-10% and EPS guidance of $15.00-$15.50.

"I think Q1's expectations are too high," he noted. For one thing, Q1 has one less day than Q4, and the dollar is "a bit stronger now" than it was in late December. Both should contribute to weaker percentage growth from the prior quarter, Le Caillec noted.

"We're very confident and very comfortable with the full-year guidance," he [added](https://ir.americanexpress.com/investor-relations/default.aspx "added").

Other credit card stocks also weakened after he made the comments. Synchrony Financial ([SYF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYF "Synchrony Financial")) stock slid 3.5%, Bread Financial ([BFH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BFH "Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.")) dipped 1.3%, Capital One Financial ([COF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF "Capital One Financial Corporation")) -2,2%, Discover Financial ([DFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DFS "Discover Financial Services")) -2.3%.

Overall, financial sector stocks fell during late morning trading, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLF "Financial Select Sector SPDRÂ® Fund ETF")) slipping 1.1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index ([BKX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKX "KBW Nasdaq Bank Index")) dropped 1.7%.
