Investment environment
----------------------

Global financial markets performance was mixed in the fourth quarter. In November, Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election sparked a strong U.S. equity market rally, with investors hoping his economic policies would underpin continued U.S. economic growth. However, Trump’s threats to ignite a global trade war pressured non-U.S. equities. Equity markets were broadly weak in December following hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank. Fixed income investments declined in both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets as bond yields rose across most sovereign curves.

Portfolio review
----------------

We extract forward-looking tail risk information embedded in the prices of options. Over the quarter, the downside risk of equities was typically about half a standard deviation lower than the long-term historical average for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, while the downside risk of fixed income was typically about half a standard deviation higher than long- term historical averages. The attractiveness, on the other hand, measured as the ratio of upside risk to downside risk, was below historical averages for U.S. equities and right around historical averages for non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, and non-U.S. fixed income. In both equities and fixed income, U.S. exposure typically offered more attractiveness per downside risk than non-U.S. exposure.

For the portfolio, positioning within the fixed income market lifted relative performance. A significant underweight in unhedged international sovereigns was especially beneficial, as international bonds generally declined during the quarter. A modest underweight allocation to U.S. fixed income also contributed.

The portfolio benefited from its notable overweight in U.S. equities, which outperformed international stocks. A moderate overweight allocation to international equities hindered relative performance as international markets broadly declined during the period.

The portfolio’s equity and fixed income exposures during the period averaged 79.61% and 18.21%, respectively.

Manager outlook
---------------

As we enter 2025, we see a conflux of economic and geopolitical risks. The key risk to the capital markets going forward is a second wave of inflation. A second wave would lead to significant market stress, hurting both equities and fixed income. Alternatively, escaping a second wave would likely carry markets higher, especially given the pro-growth economic policies President Trump is expected to pursue. However, such policies may also fuel a second wave of inflation. As a result, we believe the interaction between policy and inflation creates a complex risk dynamic.

Historically, wage growth has been the prime culprit behind second inflation waves. Such wage growth arises when workers demand compensation for lost real wages suffered during the first inflation shock, and this lag catalyzes a second inflation wave. We believe demand for higher wages today would be less impactful than in the past, as less of the U.S. labor force is unionized. Our forward-looking signals derived from option prices indicate a near-average level of attractiveness and downside risk to U.S. Treasuries, suggesting history is unlikely to repeat with a second inflation wave.

But there are clearly signs that inflation is proving more resilient than expected. The good news is that the U.S. Fed remains responsive to such risks, prompting its recent pivot to a more restrictive stance. Absent a recession, the Fed will likely keep overnight rates higher for longer to help curtail excess spending. Containment may be easier said than done, however, as inflation risk is potentially exacerbated by the pro-growth lower taxes and higher tariff policies of President Trump. The budget deficit may widen under these policies, leading to greater term premium and curve steepening, which we have seen recently. This steepening may be at its end, and long-maturity bonds may be relatively cheap as our signals see greater attractiveness for longer- maturity bonds.

President Trump’s administration brings new sources of geopolitical uncertainty, as well. The interaction of all these risks creates a complicated feedback mechanism and magnifies the complex nature of how these risks will impact the capital markets. On one side, our proprietary signals see slightly lower-than-average attractiveness for equities going forward, but on the other end, we see lower-than-average equity left-tail risk. The latter indicates recession risk is remote, but the former indicates risk-adjusted returns are not expected to be great over the short run.

The convolution of today’s risks makes it especially challenging to connect the dots and see the path markets will follow going forward. History, however, offers us a way to connect the dots and may provide insights that are difficult to glean otherwise. We continue to pay attention to our signals, based on forward option pricing of upside and downside volatility to equities and fixed income, as well as to historical statistical analysis. Based on this analysis, we expect risks and returns to be near average levels, with non-U.S. equities favored over U.S. equities and longer-maturity bonds more attractive than shorter-maturity bonds. Nevertheless, markets face an elevated number of uncertainties. Data will help resolve today’s heightened uncertainty. The key is to be able to process this data in a systematic and timely manner to better see where market risks are headed. We expect our systematic investment process, which processes both time series and cross-sectional price-based data, to provide proactive insights on where and how much active risk to take as we seek to deliver the greatest value.

It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. Expected tail gains ([ETG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETG "Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund")) and expected tail losses (ETL) are forward-looking signals based on options market prices aimed at measuring the likelihood of an underlying asset’s returns falling along the ends of their statistical distribution.  Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an unmanaged index representing the rate of inflation of the U.S. consumer prices as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics.
