Earnings Call Insights: Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:[CGC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGC "Canopy Growth Corporation")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* Luc Mongeau, the newly appointed CEO, emphasized his commitment to advancing Canopy Growth toward sustained profitability and positive cash generation. He highlighted strengths in the medical cannabis segment, particularly in Canada, Germany, Poland, and Australia, and noted the recent success of the Claybourne brand in Canada’s adult-use market.
* Mongeau cited the launch of the Claybourne brand as a key driver, achieving the number three position in infused pre-rolls in British Columbia and Ontario within six weeks. He also pointed to the integration progress of Canopy USA's acquisitions, including Wana, Jetty, and Acreage, which are beginning to realize cost synergies and operational advantages.
* CFO Judy Hong reported consolidated net revenue of CAD75 million, a 5% decrease year-over-year, but an 8% increase excluding divested businesses. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed significantly to CAD3 million, a 61% improvement year-over-year, driven by medical cannabis growth and cost efficiencies.
* Hong highlighted that Canada’s medical cannabis revenue grew 16% year-over-year, while adult-use revenue increased 15% sequentially due to the Claybourne launch and the return of Wana Gummies. International cannabis revenue rose 14%, led by growth in Poland and Germany.

### Outlook

* Management projects positive adjusted EBITDA in the coming quarters, supported by continued performance improvements in medical cannabis and adult-use businesses.
* The company anticipates further growth in international cannabis markets, particularly in Europe, driven by regulatory changes and expanded product distribution in Germany and Poland.
* For fiscal 2026, Canopy Growth aims to focus on long-term sustainable growth while enhancing profitability and cash flow.
* Mongeau indicated a detailed strategic update will be provided during the Q4 earnings call in May.

### Financial Results

* Consolidated net revenue of CAD75 million exceeded the analysts’ estimate of approximately CAD69.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss of CAD3 million also marked a substantial improvement from the previous year.
* Free cash flow outflow improved 17% year-over-year to CAD28 million, reflecting tighter working capital management. Cash and short-term investments totaled CAD178 million, while the term loan principal was reduced to CAD250 million following a CAD100 million prepayment.
* Storz & Bickel reported robust revenue of CAD22 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, supported by holiday season demand and strong online direct-to-consumer sales.

### Q&A

* Aaron Grey, Alliance Global Partners: Questioned the international strategy and asset-light model's ability to maintain market share and margins. Judy Hong responded by emphasizing Canopy’s strong positioning in Europe, particularly Poland and Germany, with scalable supply agreements and GMP-certified Canadian facilities.
* Bill Kirk, ROTH Capital Partners: Asked about differences in strategy under new leadership. CEO Mongeau stated it is too early to outline specifics but expressed confidence in the company’s talent and operational quality.
* Matt Bottomley, Canaccord Genuity: Inquired about cash flow progress and utilization of the ATM program. CFO Hong projected significant improvements in outflows for the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by reduced interest payments and better working capital management.
* Pablo Zuanic, Zuanic & Associates: Asked about leveraging Constellation Brands’ distribution for Wana products and market expansion in Europe. Management clarified that Constellation’s involvement is now limited as a passive shareholder, while Canopy continues to utilize partnerships for distribution.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed optimism about international market growth and medical cannabis performance but showed concern about challenges in Australia and adult-use competition in Canada. Questions reflected a cautious tone, particularly regarding cash flow and profitability timelines.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly when discussing medical cannabis growth and cost efficiency improvements. CEO Mongeau was measured but optimistic about future strategies, while Judy Hong emphasized operational improvements and financial discipline.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts were slightly more pressing on cash flow sustainability and competitive positioning, while management showed consistent confidence in achieving profitability.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted slightly, with management now projecting positive adjusted EBITDA in the "coming quarters" rather than explicitly in the second half of fiscal 2025. This indicates a potential adjustment in profitability timelines.
* Revenue from Claybourne and Wana products contributed to sequential improvements in Canada’s adult-use segment, a notable divergence from Q2, which saw supply disruptions.
* Gross margin declined slightly from 35% in Q2 to 32% in Q3, impacted by higher initial production costs for Claybourne products.
* Management’s tone remained optimistic but reflected a more cautious approach to timing profitability goals compared to prior calls.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about increasing competition in Australia and persistent pricing pressure in Canada’s adult-use market.
* Management noted regulatory uncertainties and supply constraints as ongoing challenges in international markets.
* CFO Hong pointed out interest payments and legacy facility costs as key contributors to cash outflows but highlighted cost reduction efforts and tight working capital management as mitigating factors.

### Final Takeaway

Canopy Growth Corporation demonstrated notable progress in narrowing losses and improving cash flow, driven by strong performances in medical cannabis and international markets. The launch of Claybourne pre-rolls and improved Wana supply contributed to sequential gains in Canada’s adult-use segment. While management maintained confidence in achieving positive adjusted EBITDA, guidance language suggested a more cautious timeline. Investors should monitor continued cost efficiencies, international market growth, and progress toward profitability in upcoming quarters.
