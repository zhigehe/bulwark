Thesis
------

China has been a conundrum for many years now. With a zig-zagging stock market, collapsing property sector and ever decreasing bond yields, it has been tough to gauge where the jurisdiction is headed. Significant capital has been destroyed trying to time a recovery, only to see market rallies turn into new downturns. We have [covered](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4642691-klip-a-conservative-way-to-obtain-china-exposure) in the past the KraneShares KWEB Covered Call Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:[KLIP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLIP "KraneShares KWEB Covered Call Strategy ETF")), a fund which employs a buy-write strategy:

Prior Rating (Seeking Alpha)





The name is up 16% since our rating, all while providing for a low volatility total return. In today's article, we are going to take the macro pulse for China, highlight how regular funds have performed in the jurisdiction, and outline why we reiterate a 'Buy' rating for this covered call name.

China macro picture - high uncertainty
--------------------------------------

While the equity market picture is hazy, the bond market in China has a clear message for investors:

 [![economy](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/48943276-17393597729334881.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/48943276-17393597729334881_origin.png) 



30-year Yields (Macroeconomics)





30-year bond yields just hit a new low in China, with the bond market signaling loud and clear a recessionary picture. Kindly remember that yields move lower when there is a problem in the economy and investors flee other asset classes for the safety of government bonds. The drop in yields in the past year has been nothing short of astounding, with 30-year rates collapsing from 3% at the end of 2023, to 1.8% today. Given the duration of long bonds, the capital gains for holders have been significant.

Traditional capital magnets for China capital have been crippled in the past five years, with the real estate sector still crumbling:

China Headlines (Bloomberg)





As per a recent piece from Bloomberg, Chinese authorities are trying to prevent another bout of panic in the sector via state interventions:

> *After four years of standing by as property developers like China Evergrande Group spiraled into default, Communist Party officials decided in late January that China Vanke Co. — one of the country’s last surviving real-estate giants — was, for now at least, too big to fail. Faced with a collapse in Vanke’s bond prices and the company’s warning of a record $6.2 billion loss, officials from the developer’s hometown in Shenzhen stepped in to take operational control. Authorities are working on a [proposal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/china-mulls-6-8-billion-funding-plan-to-help-vanke-repay-debt) to help Vanke plug a funding gap of about $6.8 billion this year.*

China's fast industrialization and the movement of the population from rural areas to the cities helped fuel a boom in real estate and ancillary services. Significant capital gains were present in the sector, but like any bubble the market is now deflating, pushing down prices, sentiment and consumption.

Range markets favor covered call funds
--------------------------------------

KLIP is a covered call fund based on the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF ([KWEB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KWEB "KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF")):

> *KLIP buys shares of the* *KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF* *(ticker: KWEB) and "writes" or "sells" corresponding call options on KWEB. Both KLIP and KWEB are benchmarked to the CSI Overseas China Internet Index, which tracks the performance of the investable universe of publicly traded China-based companies in the Internet sector.*

The fund does not pursue a systematic strategy (say selling monthly calls), but takes an active laddered approach:

Covered Calls (Fund Fact Sheet)





The above table presents the picture as of the end of January 2025, and we can see the layered approach in writing covered calls for February and March 2025. A covered call strategy dampens volatility and creates options income when markets are range bound.

KLIP has done very well since inception when benchmarked against KWEB or other China ETFs:

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)



Please note the slope of the teal line which represents KLIP. The line has de-minimis volatility, and has constantly accreted all while the likes of KWEB and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF ([FXI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXI "iShares China Large-Cap ETF")) have experienced -20% drawdowns. KLIP is an instrument which has delivered positive total returns since inception, and has removed a large portion of the volatility associated with Chinese shares. For example, let us look at vol metrics:

* KWEB: Standard Deviation 37%, Volatility 38%
* FXI: Standard Deviation 21%, Volatility 32%
* KLIP: Standard Deviation 11%, Volatility 15%

KLIP has delivered constant positive results with less than half the volatility of long only funds. The name has demonstrated that in turbulent markets active covered call strategies not only work, but thrive.

Structural features to be aware of - high dividend yield
--------------------------------------------------------

The one aspect we are not fond of for this name is the dividend policy. The name distributes all the option income, thus creating a high distribution yield:

 ![yield metrics](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/48943276-1739368134769155.png) 



Yield Metrics (Fund Fact Sheet)





While this is a true yield, it does not marry nicely with the fund's total return. The manager here has chosen an ever decreasing NAV for a high option premium. If we look at the price action in the fund in the past year we see a massive capital loss:

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_1260498fc0a7ba49e06bee388f7dd2f2.png)

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)



The fund could have distributed less and kept a steady NAV, but instead has a high distribution offset by a lower NAV. In reality, the true return rate here at constant NAV is somewhere close to 7.5% per year. We would prefer to see a stable NAV and a lower distribution, but it is not our decision to make. Why would we like that more? Tax implications. An investor in this fund, in effect, has a high income every year and starts sitting on an ever-increasing capital loss. Retail investors therefore need to assess carefully the implications for their accounts via KLIP with this structural feature in mind.

Conclusion
----------

KLIP is a covered call equities fund. The name focuses on Chinese equities via its holdings in KWEB, and takes an active approach to writing calls. The fund has been very successful since inception, posting a high total return of 21%, all while recording a -7% drawdown versus over -20% for KWEB. The instrument is ideal for range bound markets, and has been able to greatly reduce volatility for investors when compared to KWEB or FXI. The only drawback for this fund is its propensity to distribute all its option income, which results in a high dividend yield but ever decreasing NAV. An investor comfortable with this structural feature should 'Buy' here, KLIP representing a robust conservative take on China equities.
