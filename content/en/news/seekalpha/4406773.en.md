"Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!" President Donald Trump said on Wednesday via his social media platform.

The statement comes after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he and the president were focusing on 10-year Treasury yields, not the Federal Reserve's policy rate, which now stands at 4.25%-4.50%. The Fed has cut rates by 100 basis points at three straight meetings, then held steady at the January meeting.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell often affirms that political considerations don't affect the central bank's monetary policy decisions. On Tuesday, in his semi-annual testimony to Congress, he refused to speculate about the effect of potential tariffs on the economy.

Trump finished up hi[s post](https://bit.ly/4gyw9ZH "s post ") with: "Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!"

The 10-year Treasury yield rose 1.5 basis points on Wednesday morning to 4.547%.

Markets aren't expecting the Fed to cut rates at its next meeting. The probability of a 25-bp cut rose to 95.5% on Wednesday from 95.0% a day earlier, according to the CME FedWatch [tool.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html " tool.") Even for the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, the likelihood that the Fed will keep rates at 4.25%-4.50% is 78,.6%, according to rate swaps trading.
