**IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima** (NYSE:[IRS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRS "IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima")) (“Irsa”) released [results for Q2 2025](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756063-irsa-inversiones-y-representaciones-sociedad-anonima-2025-q2-results-earnings-call) (Q4 2024 calendar) that show a mixed picture.

On the one hand, there is a tremendous deceleration in economic activity in Argentina (sales in premium malls down up to 25%, and hotel occupation down close to 5pp). The company's operating segments will suffer. On the other hand, the company's real estate developments are advancing with the initiation of the company's largest project in Buenos Aires.

As always, reading Irsa's accounting is extremely complex.

I maintain that Irsa can create between $65 and $130 million in NOPAT (malls, hotels, offices). In addition to this, it has about $600 million in land banks that can be considered net assets. Considering net debt ($275 million) and the land bank ($600 million minus taxes, or $400 million), the company's EV is about $1 billion, implying an EV/NOPAT multiple of between 10x (during economic booms) and 15x (during economic busts). This does not seem high but is not particularly opportunistic either, considering the difficulty of understanding Irsa's operations, the difficulty of materializing the land bank, and the risk of Argentinian stocks. I maintain a Hold.

Q2 2025 results
---------------

**Argentinian crisis affecting operations**: Most, if not all, of Irsa's operations are in negative territory when comparing the six-month periods ended December 2024 with December 2023. The reason is that Argentina's internal market is in a deep crisis, where disposable consumption is very damaged.

The company's malls saw sales fall 8.5% in real terms YOY. In the malls in Buenos Aires (the largest ones), sales fell up to 20% and even 25% YOY. This obviously hit the variable component of mall rent (which fell by 40%). The company's malls actually generated more revenue (4% YOY in real pesos), but only because the company jacked up expenses like commissions, advertising, fund, and, most importantly, the base rent (up 35%).

This will eventually hit occupancies for an obvious reason. The tenant is selling between 8% and 20% less, but base rents are up 35% in real terms. How can businesses survive in that context? If the crisis is prolonged, Irsa's occupation in malls will fall.

Malls are the most important operational sector of the company, with offices and hotels generating breakeven EBITDA ($5 and $6 million each in adjusted terms in the 1H25 period). Still, offices have good occupancy, but the company commented that a real estate consultant has already called for lower occupancies in premium buildings (as companies close and fire workers). Hotels are in much worse shape, with occupancy falling 4pp in 2Q25 and 10pp in 1Q25. The reason is that Argentina is now very expensive in USD and therefore not a convenient destination for other Latin Americans (mainly Brazilians).

**Property development advancing**: The company's main development, Ramblas del Plata, is advancing. This project will have 700 thousand sqmt of sellable area in arguably the most premium area in Buenos Aires.

The company cannot develop the project alone, so it sells the land to other developers, sometimes for cash, debt, or apartment swaps. In 1H25, Irsa made the first sell, two lots of about 40 thousand sqmt of sellable area after development. The sale price was $23 million, with $16 million being financed by Irsa (payment terms undisclosed).

If we apply the rule of three to the above, we could get something like $400 million as total land value for the project, or 2/3 of Irsa's land bank value as of 2Q25 (about $600 million).

The company also started the Edificio del Plata (in Buenos Aires' most iconic avenue, called 9 of July), plus a few other smaller developments (a mall in La Plata, a residential complex in Caballito).

**Large fair value variations should be ignored**: Irsa's financial statements are always difficult to read, because of the company's accounting elections (like carrying its property values in one dollar rate, but translating them in another dollar rate). This generates large variations in the income statement because of fair value changes to the properties based purely on FX versus inflation changes. In this case, these are negative, but in other quarters they have been positive.

Valuation is fair, but not attractive
-------------------------------------

Irsa currently trades at a market cap of about $1.12 billion. The company has net debt (debt minus cash, investments, and credits from sold properties) of about $275 million. The company's land bank is valued at $1.8 billion, but only $600 million are net assets because the remaining $1.2 billion are malls, offices and hotels, and cannot be sold without affecting the company's earnings capacity. If the company sold these assets, it would probably pay income taxes of 35%, so the net value is closer to $400 million. This all leads to an EV of about $1 billion.

In comparison, Irsa generated operating income (adjusted to remove fair value changes) of about $85 million in 1H25, including the busy sales season (calendar 4Q24). In past years, the company has generated between $100 and $200 million in operating income (with the above adjustments) from its malls, offices, and hotels.

After taxes of 35% that would represent a range NOPAT of between $65 and $130 million. That is, the company trades at an EV/NOPAT of between 10x (during economic booms) and 15x (during economic busts).

I believe the above is fair but not particularly attractive because it is based on the company realizing the value of its land bank (it will take years and is difficult to do, as explained in previous articles) and in volatile Argentinian economic conditions. The multiple is relatively good only during booms, and Argentina is very used to busts. In addition, we have to add that Irsa's complex accounting is a negative factor.

For that reason, I do not believe the company is attractive at current prices, and maintain my Hold.
