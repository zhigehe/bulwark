Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:[STLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLD "Steel Dynamics, Inc.")) +1.6% in Tuesday's trading as KeyBanc upgrades shares to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $155 price target, citing improving operational performance at its Sinton facility and stronger steel pricing, as well as reasonable valuation compared to peers.

The Sinton plant, which lost nearly $200M in 2024, is showing signs of a turnaround due to improved upstream yields, lower maintenance costs and increased production, KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs says.

The analyst pointed to Steel Dynamics' (NASDAQ:[STLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLD "Steel Dynamics, Inc.")) strong positioning to benefit from declining steel imports, particularly in galvanized sheet, as potential tariffs could support domestic pricing.

Gibbs raises his FY 2025 EBITDA estimate to $2.57B from $2.13B previously, factoring in Sintonâ€™s recovery, higher hot-rolled coil prices, and stronger market share gains, and the analyst sees FY 2026 EBITDA to reach ~$3B, driven by improved steel profitability and ramping aluminum operations.

KeyBanc also maintains Overweight ratings for Reliance Steel ([RS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RS "Reliance, Inc.")), Worthington Steel ([WS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WS "Worthington Steel, Inc.")) and Olympic Steel ([ZEUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZEUS "Olympic Steel, Inc.")).
