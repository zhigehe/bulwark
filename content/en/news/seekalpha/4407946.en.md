Earnings Call Insights: Organon & Co. (NYSE:[OGN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OGN "Organon & Co.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Kevin Ali highlighted full-year 2024 revenue of $6.4 billion, representing a 3% growth rate at constant currency. All three franchises posted three consecutive years of constant currency revenue growth. He announced guidance for 2025, projecting revenue between $6.125 billion and $6.325 billion, inclusive of a $200 million foreign currency headwind.
* Nexplanon saw its best annual performance ever, growing 17% ex-FX in 2024 and on track to achieve $1 billion in revenue for 2025. International growth was particularly strong in the LAMERA region, with tender expansions and robust performance in Brazil.
* Women's health product Jada reached $61 million in revenue in 2024, with over 90% of the largest U.S. birthing hospitals now stocking the product. Fertility franchise revenue declined 2% ex-exchange due to inventory adjustments but demonstrated strength in China and new market launches.
* CFO Matt Walsh stated, "Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 was 31.8% ex-IPR&D, reflecting approximately half a point of margin expansion over last year." He also noted $967 million of free cash flow before one-time costs for 2024, meeting expectations.
* R&D Head Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira emphasized the potential of Vtama, which received FDA approval for atopic dermatitis in December 2024. He described it as the only non-steroidal topical approved for mild, moderate, and severe atopic dermatitis, differentiating it in the market.

### Outlook

* Full-year 2025 revenue guidance is set between $6.125 billion to $6.325 billion. Kevin Ali stated, "On a constant currency basis, the midpoint of this range would reflect flat revenue performance," accounting for an approximate $200 million Atozet LOE impact in Europe.
* Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 2025 is 31% to 32%, consistent with management's commentary to maintain a 31% floor ex-IPR&D.
* Vtama is projected to contribute $150 million in 2025 revenue, supported by its new label approval for atopic dermatitis. Nexplanon is expected to reach at least $1 billion in revenue for 2025.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue reached $1.6 billion, with a full-year total of $6.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was $1.96 billion, reflecting a margin of 30.6%.
* Women's health grew 5% ex-FX, while biosimilars increased by 12% ex-FX for the year. Established brands grew 2% ex-FX, driven by contributions from Emgality and Vtama.
* Pricing headwinds impacted revenue by $115 million in 2024, while volume growth added $415 million, led by Hadlima, Emgality, and Nexplanon.
* Free cash flow before one-time costs was $967 million for 2024. One-time costs related to restructuring and manufacturing separation from Merck are expected to continue into 2025, totaling $325 million to $375 million.

### Q&A

* Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley: Asked about free cash flow expectations for 2025 and the Denosumab biosimilar opportunity. Matt Walsh responded, "We expect free cash flow before one-time items to be around $900 million for 2025," while Kevin Ali expressed confidence in commercializing Denosumab biosimilars.
* Michael Nedelcovych, TD Cowen: Inquired about Nexplanon LOE risk and long-term growth acceleration. Kevin Ali stated that no paragraph four filing had been received and reiterated confidence in Nexplanon's exclusivity through 2030.
* Ethan Brown, JPMorgan: Asked about Vtama's competitive position. Kevin Ali emphasized its systemic-like efficacy and lack of black box warnings, describing it as a "phenomenal product" with significant growth potential.
* Jason Gerberry, Bank of America: Sought clarity on the $200 million OpEx savings for 2025. Matt Walsh explained that approximately 75% of the savings will impact SG&A and R&D, with the remainder improving COGS.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about biosimilar pricing pressures and the impact of Atozet LOE in Europe but were optimistic about Nexplanon and Vtama's growth potential. Questions reflected a mix of skepticism and curiosity on near-term profitability.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing cost-saving initiatives and the strength of growth drivers like Nexplanon and Vtama. Kevin Ali frequently reiterated long-term growth potential, while Matt Walsh confidently addressed financial metrics.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue guidance for 2025 reflects a shift to flat growth at constant currency compared to Q3's optimistic tone. However, management remains confident in Nexplanon and Vtama's contributions.
* Analysts' focus on near-term LOE headwinds and biosimilar pricing pressures remained consistent. Management's tone showed heightened emphasis on cost efficiency compared to the previous quarter.
* Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded slightly in Q4, but guidance for 2025 indicates stable margins amid restructuring and launch investments.

### Risks and Concerns

* Atozet LOE in Europe represents a $200 million revenue headwind for 2025. Management seeks to offset this with growth in Nexplanon, Vtama, and biosimilars.
* Biosimilar pricing pressures, particularly for Renflexis and Ontruzant, pose challenges. Management plans to counteract this with new launches like Denosumab.
* Analysts expressed concerns about Vtama's commercial ramp-up and the sustainability of Nexplanon's growth trajectory.

### Final Takeaway

Organon delivered its third consecutive year of constant currency revenue growth, supported by strong performance in Nexplanon and biosimilars. Management's focus now shifts to mitigating Atozet LOE headwinds and driving growth through Nexplanon, Vtama, and cost-saving initiatives. With a robust product pipeline and strategic launches, the company aims to sustain profitability and accelerate growth in the second half of the decade.
