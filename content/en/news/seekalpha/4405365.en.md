Earnings Call Insights: Eisai Co., Ltd. ([OTCPK:ESALF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESALF "Eisai Co., Ltd.")) Q3 2024

### Management View

* CEO Haruo Naito highlighted a 9% year-on-year revenue increase to 601.2 billion yen, with a focus on the pharmaceutical business driving growth. Key contributors included LEQEMBI with a 28.1 billion yen increase, Lenvima with 24.9 billion yen growth, and Dayvigo up by 9.3 billion yen.
* Naito emphasized significant milestones for LEQEMBI, including its approval for IV maintenance dosing in the US, which reduces treatment frequency and is expected to enhance patient and institutional throughput. He stated, "We believe that we are moving towards a growth expansion phase of LEQEMBI."
* CFO Terushige Iike reported a 48% year-on-year increase in operating profit to 55.4 billion yen, citing robust performance from the three leading products and efficient R&D expenditure allocation.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its FY2024 revenue target of 42.5 billion yen for LEQEMBI, with regional forecasts including 26.5 billion yen in the US, 12 billion yen in Japan, and 4 billion yen in China and other markets.
* The company expects further expansion of infusion capacity and patient access in the US, supported by increased Amyloid beta PET testing and removal of reimbursement caps.
* The PDUFA date for LEQEMBI’s SC-AI subcutaneous formulation is set for August 31, 2025. This development is expected to ease the treatment burden and potentially boost adoption.

### Financial Results

* Revenue reached 601.2 billion yen, with the pharmaceutical business contributing 569.1 billion yen, an 8% increase year-on-year.
* Gross profit increased 9% to 473 billion yen, while the cost-to-sales ratio improved to 21.3%, driven by favorable shifts in product mix.
* R&D expenses accounted for 20.8% of revenue, reflecting enhanced efficiency. Operating profit rose 48% year-on-year to 55.4 billion yen.
* LEQEMBI’s global revenue surged to 29.6 billion yen in Q3, with US sales growing 131% and Japan sales climbing 149% compared to the prior quarter.

### Q&A

* Hidemaru Yamaguchi, Citigroup, asked about LEQEMBI’s IV maintenance dosing impact. Katsuya Haruna, head of LEQEMBI business, stated that while only about 100 patients have transitioned to the new dosing, around 10,000 are expected to shift by the next fiscal year, emphasizing its potential to enhance clinical value.
* Seiji Wakao, JPMorgan, inquired about Lenvima’s growth amid Medicare Part D redesign. Terushige Iike acknowledged a potential million-dollar impact but noted that strong performance in renal cell and endometrial carcinoma treatments would offset this.
* Miki Sogi, Bernstein, questioned LEQEMBI’s timeline to reach $1 billion in US revenue. Haruna refrained from specifying but expressed high confidence in surpassing this milestone, citing the transformative potential of SC-AI and BBM.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, frequently probing LEQEMBI’s growth trajectory, competitive positioning, and cost management. Concerns were raised about competitive threats and regulatory hurdles.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding LEQEMBI’s expansion, emphasizing its transformative potential and robust regional uptake. Haruo Naito’s repeated assurances of achieving fiscal targets bolstered sentiment.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Comparison to the previous quarter is unavailable due to a lack of prior transcript data.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged the impact of Medicare Part D redesign but highlighted mitigating factors such as strong oncology drug performance and cost-control measures.
* Regulatory delays for LEQEMBI’s SC-AI formulation were addressed, with the standard review timeline extending to August 2025.
* Increased competition in the Alzheimer’s treatment market, particularly from upcoming bispecific antibodies, was noted but deemed non-threatening due to LEQEMBI’s established efficacy and safety profile.

### Final Takeaway

Eisai reported strong Q3 2024 performance driven by its leading products, particularly LEQEMBI, which saw robust sales growth across key regions. Management expressed confidence in achieving its fiscal year targets, supported by pathway expansions, regulatory progress, and new product formulations. While cost pressures and competition remain concerns, the company’s proactive strategies and market positioning underscore its growth potential.
