UBS has upgraded AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:[AZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN "AstraZeneca PLC")) to buy from neutral, stating it believes the company's in-market growth potential has been underestimated.

The investment bank said its forecasts for the oncology drug Imfinzi are $1B ahead of consensus on new small cell lung and bladder cancer indications, while Breztri estimates are $500M ahead on a potential label broadening. 

UBS noted, however, that its model shows faster Lynparza generic erosion than the consensus.

The bank views 2025 as a "key catalyst year with data on seven high-value new drugs plus material line extensions."

"We like the diversified catalyst path for AZN, no longer dominated by Dato-DXd," UBS added.
