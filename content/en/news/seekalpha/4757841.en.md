Over the past months, I’ve been bullish on Confluent, Inc. (NASDAQ:[CFLT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFLT "Confluent, Inc.")) thanks to its consumption-based [revenue model](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718150-confluent-a-streaming-star-in-the-making "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4718150-confluent-a-streaming-star-in-the-making#hasComeFromMpArticle=false") and its potential to report [record](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735843-confluent-strong-q3-sets-the-stage-for-a-festive-quarter "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735843-confluent-strong-q3-sets-the-stage-for-a-festive-quarter") Q4 2024 revenues. My bullish thesis has been proven by the company’s latest Q4 and FY 2024 earnings release which has caused the stock to shoot up 25% in intraday trading.

In addition, Confluent is showing signs of efficient growth as it reported a significant improvement in non-GAAP profitability, as well as reporting record free cash flow. With that in mind, Confluent has a significant market opportunity that could aid its rapid growth over the coming years in light of its diversified offering portfolio and an expanded partnership with Databricks. It is for these reasons that I’m reiterating my buy rating for Confluent and maintaining my price target of $237 per share by 2032.

Q4 Overview
-----------

In Q4 2024, Confluent [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19998986-confluent-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19998986-confluent-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results") 23% YoY revenue growth from $213.2 million to $261.2 million. The company’s topline growth was driven by subscription revenues growing 24% YoY from $202.8 million to $250.6 million. The company’s subscription revenue growth was mainly due to cloud revenues increasing 38% YoY to [$138 million](https://investors.confluent.io/static-files/1d76dde4-7b12-4847-b9f0-bfba014a5171 "https://investors.confluent.io/static-files/1d76dde4-7b12-4847-b9f0-bfba014a5171") compared to $100 million in the prior year. Thus, cloud revenue represented 55% of subscription revenue in Q4 2024 compared to 49% in the prior year.

Based on this, Confluent’s subscription gross margin slightly expanded from 77.9% to 78%, with more room to expand as cloud revenues represent a higher percentage of subscription revenues. On that note, management expects cloud subscription revenue mix to increase by 1% each quarter in FY 2025 to exit the year at 59% to 60%, as mentioned in the [Q4 earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757217-confluent-inc-cflt-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757217-confluent-inc-cflt-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript"). Overall, Confluent reported a gross margin of 74.1% in Q4 2024 compared to 73.2% in Q4 2023 due to services gross margin improving from -17.8% to -16.6%.

On a full-year basis, Confluent reported revenues of $963.6 million, including $922 million in subscription revenue, representing a 24% YoY increase from nearly $777 million. The company’s gross margin also expanded YoY during FY 2024 to 73.3% compared to 70.4%, as a result of subscription gross margin expanding from 75.9% to 77.4%.

From a cost perspective, Confluent’s operating loss increased significantly YoY in Q4, despite the rapid topline growth, from $84.7 million to $105.8 million due to increased investments in R&D and sales and marketing activities. These costs were also higher as a percentage of revenue in Q4 2024 compared to the prior year, as shown in the following table.

    | Item | Q4 24 | Q4 23 |
| Total Revenue | $261,220,000 | $213,184,000 |

| Operating Margin | -40.5% | -39.7% |

However, on a full-year basis, Confluent’s cost structure appears to be more efficient as operating loss improved from $478.8 million in FY 2023 to $419.1 million in FY 2024, leading to a significant improvement in operating margin to -43.5% compared to -61.6%, as represented in the following table.

    | Item | FY 24 | FY 23 |
| Total Revenue | $963,642,000 | $776,952,000 |

| Operating Margin | -43.5% | -61.6% |

Although Confluent’s GAAP earnings show massive losses, looking at its non-GAAP figures paints a different picture as the majority of its operating costs are SBC. Despite the dilutive impact of the high SBC, the company intends to tackle this by reducing SBC to represent 25% of revenues in the medium-term and to be somewhere in the mid-teens in the long-term.

On a non-GAAP basis, Confluent reported an operating income of $13.6 million in Q4 compared to $11.4 million in the prior year. However, its operating margin slightly dropped YoY from 5.3% to 5.2% as a result of the increased R&D and sales and marketing activities.

    | Item | Q4 24 | Q4 23 |
| Revenue | $261,220,000 | $213,184,000 |
| R&D | $58,902,000 | $46,135,000 |
| % of Revenue | 22.5% | 21.6% |

Meanwhile, on a full-year basis, Confluent reported a positive non-GAAP operating margin for the first time at 2.9% compared to -7.4% in FY 2023. In this way, the company’s non-GAAP income [increased](https://investors.confluent.io/static-files/9a761aaf-399a-4201-85ce-2802f42d4651 "https://investors.confluent.io/static-files/9a761aaf-399a-4201-85ce-2802f42d4651") substantially YoY from $13 million to $102.2 million.

    | Item | FY 24 | FY 23 |
| Revenue | $963,642,000 | $776,952,000 |
| R&D | $225,000,000 | $185,703,000 |
| % of Revenue | 23.3% | 23.9% |

| Op Income | $27,491,000 | -$57,344,000 |
| Op Margin | 2.9% | -7.4% |

In terms of liquidity, Confluent has a strong balance sheet with $1.9 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities, while carrying $1.1 billion in debt, leaving it with a net cash position of around $809 million. The company is also starting to generate free cash flow at a healthy pace, as it generated free cash flow of $29.1 million in Q4 2024 at a FCF margin of 11.1% compared to $6.8 million in the prior year at a FCF margin of 3.2%.

On a full-year basis, Confluent generated $9.5 million in free cash flow at a FCF margin of 1% compared to $124.3 million in free cash outflow in FY 2023. The company’s ability to generate cash flow will further improve its already strong liquidity position, which the company can leverage to pursue additional growth opportunities, similar to its acquisition of WarpStream last September. The company’s strong liquidity position could also help it initiate share buyback programs in order to limit the dilutive impact of its elevated SBC.

      | Item | Q4 24 | Q4 23 | FY 24 | FY 23 |
| OCF | $35,211,000 | $12,235,000 | $33,460,000 | -$103,657,000 |
| CapEx | $6,089,000 | $5,415,000 | $23,971,000 | $20,679,000 |
| FCF | $29,122,000 | $6,820,000 | $9,489,000 | -$124,336,000 |
| FCF Margin | 11.1% | 3.2% | 1.0% | -16.0% |

Looking forward, Confluent is guiding Q1 2025 subscription revenues in a range between $253 and $254 million and a non-GAAP EPS between $0.06 and $0.07. For FY 2025, the company expects subscription revenues between $1.117 and $1.121 billion, implying 21% YoY growth at the midpoint, and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.35. The company also expects to generate free cash flow at a margin of 6%, which amounts to $67.1 million, at the midpoint of its full-year subscription revenue guidance.

Significant Market Opportunity Ahead
------------------------------------

The rapid topline growth Confluent is seeing is mainly due to the momentum its business continues to witness. During Q4, the company’s customer count increased 17% YoY from 4960 to 5800, including a 12.4% YoY increase in the $100 thousand plus ARR cohort from 1229 to 1381. In my opinion, the growth of this cohort is a testament to the value brought by Confluent’s offerings, which is especially promising for future growth considering that this cohort is responsible for 90% of subscription revenues. Meanwhile, the $1 million plus ARR cohort continues growing rapidly, with 23% YoY growth from 158 to 194.

     |  | Q4 24 | Q4 23 | Change |
| Total Customers | 5800 | 4960 | 16.9% |
| Customers >$100K ARR | 1381 | 1229 | 12.4% |
| Customers >$1M ARR | 194 | 158 | 22.8% |

Confluent also reported an NRR of 117% during Q4, unchanged from Q3, with the potential to expand significantly in the long-term thanks to the quality of customers the company continues to add. During Q4, new Confluent customers included a top 5 video gaming company, one of the world’s largest sports media outlets, a Fortune 100 pharmaceuticals company, a global cruise line operator, and a leading European airline company, among others.

Another factor that could have a major impact on future NRR expansion is growing sales of Confluent’s data streaming platform (DSP) that continues to gain momentum. In Q4, DSP represented 13% of Confluent’s cloud business, per management in the Q4 earnings call, a promising sign for revenue growth and NRR expansion in 2025 and beyond.

WarpStream is also showing promising signs regarding its future contribution to revenues as every deal Confluent closed since acquiring WarpStream has been from its digital native cohort, including deals with Elastic ([ESTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESTC "Elastic N.V.")) and AI code editor, Cursor. Both deals could have a material impact on Confluent’s future revenues thanks to Confluent’s consumption-based revenue model in light of the data amounts that both Elastic and Cursor deal with.

Meanwhile, Confluent still has a significant market opportunity in Apache Kafka as its customer base of 5800 represents less than 4% of the more than 150 thousand enterprises utilizing Kafka. As is, management stated in the Q4 earnings call that its first land of a new customer is usually a conversion from open source Kafka. This is mainly due to these customers looking to scale their operations, which becomes more efficient utilizing Confluent’s platform in terms of costs and efficiency.

In addition to its diversified portfolio of offerings, Confluent’s latest [partnership](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19998988-confluent-and-databricks-partner-to-usher-in-new-age-of-real-time-ai "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19998988-confluent-and-databricks-partner-to-usher-in-new-age-of-real-time-ai") with Databricks could be another boon for future growth. This partnership brings Confluent’s DSP together with Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform to provide enterprises with real-time data for AI-driven decision making. The significance of this deal is that it provides Confluent with access to Databricks’ extensive customer base of more than 10 thousand enterprises globally, including more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies.

Accordingly, this partnership could help Confluent expand its reach and acquire new customers at a relatively low cost by leveraging its integration with Databricks. Moreover, the integration with Databricks improves the value proposition of Confluent’s DSP, potentially making its platform a more attractive choice for enterprises building AI-powered applications. This could give Confluent a competitive advantage in the data streaming market by offering a solution that addresses the challenges of real-time data integration for AI.

Technical Analysis

TrendSpider



Looking at the TrendSpider chart above, Confluent’s latest run on the Q4 earnings report has seen the stock break out of a key multi-year resistance level on the daily, which it briefly broke through last July before falling back below that level. That said, Confluent appears to be also breaking out of a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. By applying the distance between the neckline and the lowest point in the head, my short-term target for Confluent, in the case of a successful breakout, would be near $49, which would represent a potential 30% gain.

Risks
-----

The main risk to my bullish thesis on Confluent is its elevated SBC levels. In Q4, SBC represented 41.2% of total revenues, while representing 43.3% of full-year total revenue. While the company intends to lower this percentage to 25% in the medium-term and in the mid-teens in the long-term, any delays in reaching these targets could negatively impact the stock price given the size of this dilution.

     | Quarter | SBC | Revenue | % of Revenue |
| Q1 24 | $102,985,000 | $217,237,000 | 47.41% |
| Q2 24 | $104,700,000 | $234,986,000 | 44.56% |
| Q3 24 | $101,837,000 | $250,199,000 | 40.70% |
| Q4 24 | $107,579,000 | $261,220,000 | 41.18% |
| Total | $417,101,000 | $963,642,000 | 43.28% |

Another risk to consider is growth slowing down than current levels. At a forward EV/sales multiple of 11.07 at the midpoint of management’s FY 2025 subscription revenue guidance, expectations of continued robust growth are priced in the stock. Therefore, failing to meet estimates in the coming quarters could send shares of Confluent spiraling.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, I remain bullish on Confluent as its Q4 earnings further reinforce my bullish thesis on the stock. The company continues to maintain robust topline growth, while also improving its bottom line as witnessed by its record non-GAAP net income, a sign of efficient growth. Moreover, Confluent is starting to generate meaningful free cash flow, which when combined with its strong net cash balance, could help it pursue additional growth opportunities or buy back shares to limit the impact of its elevated SBC.

Meanwhile, Confluent has a significant market opportunity ahead as its customer base represents less than 4% of all organizations utilizing Apache Kafka. The company’s diversified offerings portfolio that caters to different enterprises’ needs could help it continue attracting customers utilizing open source Kafka to its platform. In addition, Confluent’s latest partnership with Databricks offers an opportunity to attract new customers by leveraging Databricks’ extensive customer base of over 10 thousand enterprises, including more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies. In light of this, I’m reiterating my buy rating for Confluent and maintaining my price target of $237 per share by 2032.
