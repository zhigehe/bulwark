Goldman Sachs (NYSE:[GS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.")) is reversing its policy that barred companies with all-white, male boards from going public, dropping the diversity requirement it set in 2020, according to a media report dated Tuesday.

“As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” said Tony Fratto, a company spokesperson, Bloomberg reported. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”

The move comes as the new Trump administration has beefed up efforts to eliminate DEI initiatives from companies, with an initial focus on federal contractors.

Even after rescinding its IPO diversity pledge, investment banking giant Goldman (NYSE:[GS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.")) will persist in helping companies find diverse board members, Fratto [noted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/goldman-kills-ipo-diversity-pledge-with-us-dei-goals-under-fire "noted").
