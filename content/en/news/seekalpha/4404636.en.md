McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) will release its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report on Monday before the market opens. Investors and analysts are anticipating a challenging quarter for the fast-food giant, but will be looking for signs of an inflection late in the quarter and a positive read on the outlook for 2025.

Revenue is projected to increase slightly in Q4 to $6.48 billion, up 1.1% from a year ago. Notably, comparable sales are seen falling both globally and in the U.S. based on consensus estimates. EPS is forecast to come in at $2.86 vs. $2.95 a year ago.

The company's sluggish performance during the quarter may have been impacted by increased competition from grocery stores and pricing pressures. Weather-related challenges affecting customer traffic and the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak from late October may have also been drags.

However, Seeking Alpha [analyst Luca Socci](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752577-mcdonalds-committed-to-winning-the-value-battle-q4-earnings-preview "analyst Luca Socci") thinks McDonald's (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) could beat the U.S. comparable sale estimate of -0.9% Y/Y.

"Recent trends show that QSR saw positive Q4 traffic development in the U.S., with a 0.8% increase YoY. Many believe that McDonald's was one of the main players leading the charge of this traffic rebound thanks to its $5 menu. If this proves true, we will then see McDonald's report U.S. comp sales up by at least 1%. This means that sales should also be up by a couple of percentage points."

On the earnings conference call, analysts will be looking for color on the performance of McDonald's (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) value initiatives, including the McValue menu and $5 Meal Deal, which were implemented to boost customer traffic. Additionally, any updates on digital adoption, menu innovations, and unit expansion will be of interest.

Options trading on MCD implies a share price swing of 3.5% after the report drops.
