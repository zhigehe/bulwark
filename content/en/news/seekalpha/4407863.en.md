Sable Offshore (NYSE:[SOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOC "Sable Offshore Corp.")) +23.2% after saying it received a letter from the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Department in California that certain pipeline repair work on the Las Flores pipeline system is "[authorized by existing permits](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9546601 "authorized by existing permits")."

The Form 8-K disclosure also said the California Coastal Commission had been informed by the county that no further applications or actions were required for the repair work to proceed.

The 124-mile-long Las Flores system has been shut down since a 2015 oil spill, where a corroded pipeline ruptured and released 450K gallons of oil near Refugio State Beach, disrupting one of the most biologically diverse areas on the California coast.

[In December](https://www.courthousenews.com/controversial-pipeline-re-opening-set-to-move-forward-with-california-waiver/ "In December"), Sable Offshore (NYSE:[SOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOC "Sable Offshore Corp.")) received a waiver from the California fire marshal, exempting it from certain corrosion safety requirements for the system.
