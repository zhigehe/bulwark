Earnings Call Insights: Mitek Systems (NASDAQ:[MITK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MITK "Mitek Systems, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Ed West highlighted Mitek's focus on enhancing solutions, operational excellence, and setting the foundation for durable, profitable growth in fiscal 2026. He emphasized the importance of scaling the identity platform, expanding fraud solutions, and achieving operational efficiencies.
* Mitek reported progress on its four strategic pillars, including fostering cross-functional collaboration across go-to-market teams, realigning R&D for better growth support, and consolidating identity verification engines into a single unified platform. These efforts are expected to drive measurable benefits in fiscal 2026.
* CFO Dave Lyle noted that total revenue for fiscal Q1 2025 reached $37.3 million, reflecting a slight year-over-year increase. He stated, "Adjusted EBITDA reached $7.8 million, representing a 32% year-over-year increase and a 21% margin." Cost efficiencies and disciplined management of expenses contributed to these results.

### Outlook

* Mitek reiterated its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance range of $170 million to $180 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin guidance was raised to a range of 25% to 28%, reflecting cost benefits realized in Q1.
* The company expects SaaS revenue to approach half of its total revenue by fiscal 2026, up from the current level of 39%. Revenue phasing for fiscal 2025 is expected to follow a similar pattern to fiscal 2024.

### Financial Results

* Total Q1 revenue was $37.3 million, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in identity products revenue, offset by a 9% decline in deposit products revenue due to timing-related factors in mobile deposit renewals.
* SaaS revenue grew 29% year-over-year, with notable contributions from Check Fraud Defender and MiVIP. Deposit SaaS revenue rose by 64% year-over-year, while identity SaaS revenue increased by 26%.
* Annualized contract value ([ACV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACV "Virtus AllianzGI Diversified Income & Convertible Fund")) for Check Fraud Defender approached $12 million at the end of Q1, with management targeting to double this value by fiscal year-end 2025.

### Q&A

* Jake Roberge, William Blair: Questioned near-term opportunities for MiVIP and double-digit growth potential. CEO West expressed confidence in returning to double-digit CAGR post-transition, citing strong customer feedback and momentum in fraud and identity solutions.
* Mike Grondahl, Northland Securities: Asked about the sales cycle for Check Fraud Defender's top 10 bank client. West confirmed that the sales cycle was over a year for the specific client but noted shorter cycles for others. Grondahl also inquired about mobile check reorder timing, which CFO Lyle stated was in line with expectations.
* Allen Klee, Maxim Group: Raised concerns about flat deposit growth and limited identity growth within fiscal 2025 guidance. CFO Lyle acknowledged headwinds but emphasized significant opportunities for growth in MiVIP and Check Fraud Defender.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed optimism about growth opportunities for MiVIP and Check Fraud Defender but highlighted concerns over mobile deposit renewal timing and identity product headwinds. The tone was slightly positive overall, with analysts seeking clarity on execution timelines and strategic priorities.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing progress on strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies. However, during Q&A, CEO West acknowledged challenges in achieving the identity segment's profitability fulcrum point.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was more focused on delivering operational stability and long-term growth, aligning with their fiscal 2026 goals.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Fiscal Q1 2025's revenue grew slightly year-over-year, compared to stronger growth in fiscal Q4 2024. Identity segment revenue showed continued growth, while mobile deposit timing challenges persisted.
* Management's fiscal 2025 revenue guidance remained consistent with prior expectations, though the adjusted EBITDA margin range was raised.
* Analysts remained focused on long-term growth drivers, particularly SaaS and Check Fraud Defender, while pressing management on identity product execution.

### Risks and Concerns

* Mobile deposit revenue remains subject to timing-related variability, impacting short-term performance.
* Continued pricing pressure on standalone identity products could weigh on revenue growth. Management is addressing this by driving adoption of higher-margin MiVIP transactions.
* The identity segment's path to profitability depends on achieving $80 million to $85 million in revenue, with management targeting fiscal 2026 for this milestone.

### Final Takeaway

Mitek Systems reported solid progress on its strategic initiatives, particularly in scaling its identity platform and expanding Check Fraud Defender. While fiscal 2025 guidance reflects modest growth, management is positioning the company for stronger SaaS-driven performance and profitability in fiscal 2026. The commitment to operational discipline and product innovation remains central to Mitek's strategy.
