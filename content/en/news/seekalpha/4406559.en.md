Earnings Call Insights: Tigo Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:[TYGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TYGO "Tigo Energy, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Zvi Alon highlighted Tigo Energy's achievement of four consecutive quarters of revenue growth in 2024, with strong contributions from the EMEA and Americas regions. Efforts in markets like Malaysia and Hawaii were emphasized, alongside utility-scale wins and the expansion of the Predict+ AI platform. The Predict+ platform now manages 140,000 meters, up significantly from 15,000 at the start of the year, covering 600 gigawatt hours of energy.
* Alon also noted the growth of annual recurring revenue ([ARR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARR "ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.")), which has surpassed $1 million, and the expansion of the Green Glove program, which has reached 1,000 site arrangements globally.
* CFO Bill Roeschlein explained that inventory reserve charges impacted results, particularly in the GO ESS storage and solutions business. He stated, "In 2024, our GO ESS storage and solutions business represented 6% of total sales, compared with 9% of total sales in the prior year."

### Outlook

* Management provided guidance for the first quarter of 2025, projecting revenues between $17 million and $19 million and adjusted EBITDA loss between $2.5 million and $4.5 million.
* For the full year of 2025, revenue is expected to range from $85 million to $100 million. CEO Alon expressed confidence in the company's ability to increase revenue steadily throughout 2025, supported by its robust product portfolio.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for Q4 2024 was reported at $17.3 million, an 86.8% year-over-year increase and a 21.3% sequential rise. Regional contributions included EMEA at $11.2 million (65% of total revenue), Americas at $4.6 million (27%), and APAC at $1.5 million (9%).
* Gross loss for the quarter was (-$12.6 million), primarily due to a $19.5 million inventory charge. Excluding this charge, gross margins were reported at 40.2%.
* Operating expenses declined by 29.8% year-over-year to $11.6 million, driven by cost-cutting measures.
* The GAAP net loss for the quarter was (-$26.8 million), while adjusted EBITDA loss stood at (-$22.1 million).
* Inventory levels were reduced significantly, with net inventories decreasing by 53% sequentially to $22 million.

### Q&A

* Eric Stine, Craig-Hallum Capital Group: Asked about adjusted EBITDA guidance and inventory reserve charges. CFO Roeschlein clarified that while inventory charges exceeded expectations, the reserve taken is considered sufficient.
* Phil Shen, ROTH Capital Partners: Inquired about geographic revenue mix and market outlook for EMEA. CEO Alon confirmed that Germany, the UK, and Italy remain key markets, with steady performance expected in 2025. He also highlighted strong growth in the UK and optimism for Germany despite external forecasts of potential declines.
* Gus Richard, Northland: Asked about gross margin performance. Roeschlein attributed the strong margins to product cost improvements and the high-margin TS4-X product line.
* Sameer Joshi, H.C. Wainwright: Queried about 2025 revenue growth drivers. Roeschlein noted contributions from new geographies like Australia and ongoing recovery in major markets like Germany and Italy.

### Sentiment Analysis
