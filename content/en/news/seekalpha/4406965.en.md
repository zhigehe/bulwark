Earnings Call Insights: American International Group (NYSE:[AIG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIG "American International Group, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Peter Zaffino, Chairman and CEO, highlighted strong underwriting results in Q4 2024, with net premiums written at $6.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, and adjusted after-tax income per share increasing to $1.30. He emphasized the restructuring of the General Insurance business into three segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial, and Global Personal, aimed at enhancing operational focus.
* Zaffino detailed the company's achievements for 2024, including the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial and the execution of $8.1 billion in capital returned to shareholders. He noted the success of AIG Next, which achieved $450 million in run-rate savings by year-end.
* Keith Walsh, CFO, explained the impact of the organizational changes, which included improvements in financial disclosures and the integration of General Insurance expense reporting. He noted that General Insurance underwriting income was $454 million for the quarter, despite higher catastrophe losses.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its target of achieving a core ROE of more than 10% for the full year 2025, including the impact of $500 million in anticipated wildfire losses. Zaffino outlined key drivers for this target, including disciplined underwriting, investment income growth, and expense management.
* AIG expects continued benefits from its reinsurance strategy, which maintained low attachment points and expanded high-net-worth portfolio coverage for 2025.
* The company provided early projections for meaningful organic growth in 2025, driven by the Global Commercial business and the restructured reinsurance program.

### Financial Results

* General Insurance reported net premiums written of $6.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with Global Commercial lines growing by 8% and new business increasing by 16%. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%, and the accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.6%.
* For the full year 2024, the General Insurance combined ratio was 91.8%, marking the third consecutive year of a sub-92% ratio. Full-year adjusted after-tax income was $3.3 billion, or $4.95 per diluted share, reflecting a 28% year-over-year increase.
* Catastrophe losses for Q4 included $325 million, mainly due to Hurricane Milton and adjustments from prior events. Favorable prior-year reserve development contributed $102 million.

### Q&A

* Alex Scott, Barclays, asked about AIG's ability to maintain its 10% ROE guidance amidst wildfire impacts. Zaffino confirmed the guidance, citing structured reinsurance strategies and improvements in personal lines as key contributors.
* Meyer Shields, KBW, inquired about the timeline for high-net-worth personal lines to achieve underwriting profitability. Zaffino explained that while improvements were already evident in Q4, further progress is expected in 2025, supported by non-admitted rate increases and optimized reinsurance agreements.
* Jon Newsome, Piper Sandler, questioned potential M&A and divestitures. Zaffino indicated that while the company is largely done with divestitures, it remains disciplined in exploring compelling inorganic opportunities.
