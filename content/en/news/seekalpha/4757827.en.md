United Parcel Service (NYSE:[UPS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPS "United Parcel Service, Inc.")) made waves in the market with its announcement that it had reached an agreement to reduce the volume it handles for Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) by more than 50% by mid-2026. The immediate reaction? Anxiety. Investors saw the headline—one of UPS’s largest customers scaling back—and assumed trouble ahead. Shares dipped, and analysts questioned whether UPS was setting itself up for long-term revenue decline.

A more careful review of the company's Q4 2024 earnings call, however, reveals exactly the opposite. This transaction is not a loss, but a strategic action to propel profitability, reposition the company for sustainable growth, and regain control of its business mix. Indeed, though revenue will take a hit in the short term, UPS’s margins are poised to expand significantly, setting the stage for a stronger, leaner company in the years ahead. The move will allow the company to focus on fewer but more lucrative deliveries while it also cuts about $1 billion in costs for buildings, trucks, planes, and labor.

Amazon: A Big Name, But a Low-Margin Deal
-----------------------------------------

Amazon has been a major customer of UPS for nearly three decades, but as CFO Brian Dykes and CEO Carol Tomé made clear on the call, it was not a particularly profitable one. Although Amazon represented 11.8% of overall UPS revenue in 2024 (approximately $10.7 billion), its margins were significantly lower than those of other customers. Tomé [put it bluntly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753465-united-parcel-service-inc-ups-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript):

> Amazon is our largest customer, but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. Domestic business.

With Amazon's contract up for renegotiation, UPS leadership assessed the long-term impact of the partnership and determined that its current structure was placing pressure on profit margins. Tomé [explained](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753465-united-parcel-service-inc-ups-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript):

> Our contract with Amazon came up this year. And so we said, it’s time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship. Because if we take no action, it will likely result in diminishing returns.

Instead of maintaining a high-volume but unprofitable partnership, UPS decided to significantly accelerate the reduction of Amazon's shipping volume. Between 2021 and 2024, UPS had been gradually decreasing Amazon’s daily volume by approximately 250,000 packages per year. Now, that pace will increase fivefold to 1.25 million packages per year, aiming for a 50% reduction by mid-2026.

Why the Market Got It Wrong
---------------------------

The initial reaction was expected—investors viewed the revenue decline as a challenge for UPS. However, UPS leadership presented a clear strategy outlining why this shift is a positive step forward.

### 1. Margins Will Improve

UPS is deliberately shifting its focus toward more profitable customers and services. Tomé [made it clear](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753465-united-parcel-service-inc-ups-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) that the Amazon deal was holding back margin expansion:

> “Had we not accelerated the Amazon volume down, we would be capping our margin in a slow-growth market. Now we have an opportunity to grow and grow margin, too.”

 [![UPS margins](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/35000895-17394193989402242.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/35000895-17394193989402242_origin.png) 



UPS





By moving away from low-margin Amazon business, UPS can prioritize segments that provide stronger returns, such as SMBs, healthcare, and B2B shipments. Dykes [reinforced this point](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753465-united-parcel-service-inc-ups-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript):

> Even while we’re undergoing the largest network reconfiguration in our history, we expect to expand U.S. Domestic operating margin in every quarter of 2025, with full-year operating margin approaching 9%. As the impact of our cost-out efforts increases over the next 18 months, we expect the pace of operating margin improvement to accelerate into 2026, where we expect by the fourth quarter to generate a 12% U.S. operating margin.

He further said, “[business from the China-linked e-commerce sellers is more profitable than the Amazon business](https://www.reuters.com/business/ups-forecasts-2025-revenue-below-estimates-2025-01-30/).” These China-linked e-commerce sellers have the challenge of tariffs to deal with, but that is a story for another day.

### 2. Strategic Cost Reductions

UPS is not just letting Amazon’s volume disappear—it’s actively resizing its network to match its new business mix. Five facilities were already partially or fully closed in January, and up to 10% of the U.S. network is expected to be shut down as part of the transition. Nando Cesarone, EVP & President of U.S. Operations, emphasized that this isn’t theoretical—it’s already happening:

> Just to give you comfort here, you'll know that five facilities already in January have been partially or completely closed. And this year, we'll have 140 active Network of the Future projects, 61 of them will go live this year, driving up the number of shipments that run through our automated facilities.

### 3. Stronger Pricing Power

One of the biggest constraints Amazon placed on UPS was in pricing. With Amazon volume shrinking, UPS can focus on customers who value its premium services. Brian Dykes explained:

> We are deliberately shifting our business and increasing our focus on growing higher-yielding volume and value share… We have shown pricing discipline in the second half of 2024. We saw great revenue per piece growth in the fourth quarter, and that’s going to extend into 2025.

UPS expects revenue per piece (RPP) to increase by approximately 6% in 2025 - even as average daily US volume drops by 8.5%, driven by improved pricing and a better customer mix.

### 4. Focus on Growth Markets

While Amazon’s volume is shrinking, UPS is aggressively expanding in high-margin areas. SMBs, which made up nearly 29% of UPS’s total U.S. volume in 2024, are expected to reach 32% in 2025. Tomé outlined the company’s growth ambitions:

> The small package market, excluding Amazon, is projected to grow in the low single digits in 2025, and we project to take share. One area we will gain share is SMBs… We’re going to take that up to 32% in 2025 on our way to 35% in 2026 and beyond.

The company is strengthening its focus on healthcare logistics, aiming to grow its $10.5 billion healthcare business to $20 billion by 2026.

Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain
-------------------------------

UPS will see a revenue dip in 2025, with projections calling for a 2.3% decline in U.S. as the company expects revenue of $89 billion, which is less than 2024 revenue of $91.1 billion. But what’s crucial is that profitability will rise. UPS expects U.S. Domestic revenue per piece to grow 6% in 2025, U.S. Domestic operating margin to approach 9% in 2025 and Operating margin to hit 12% by Q4 2026. Tomé made it clear that UPS is not shrinking, it’s repositioning for sustainable, profitable growth:

> This is not a company that’s shrinking. This is a company that’s gliding down its largest customer, but it’s not a company that’s shrinking. It’s a company that’s growing… We anticipate, based on the numbers we've just laid out for you today, that our return on invested capital will grow about 300 basis points year-on-year.

The market’s initial reaction to the Amazon deal focused on the short-term revenue impact. However, UPS’s decision to reduce low-margin volume is a strategic move aimed at strengthening long-term profitability. Most importantly, while UPS is reducing Amazon-related business, Carol doesn’t expect the relationship to disappear entirely as Amazon still relies heavily on The UPS Store locations for customer returns, a critical part of its logistics ecosystem. The bottom line is that Carol Tomé and the team made the tough call, but it was the right one for UPS’s future. My strong belief is that this move will be vindicated.
