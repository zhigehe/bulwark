Earnings Call Insights: MSA Safety (NYSE:[MSA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSA "MSA Safety Incorporated")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Steven Blanco highlighted MSA Safety's strong operational execution despite a dynamic operating environment. He noted margin expansion through SG&A management, earnings growth, and solid free cash flow generation, although sales growth was lower than expected due to industrial market weakness and softer US fire service demand. He also emphasized the company's confidence in its long-term strategy, stating, "The progress we have made this year on advancing this strategy provides us with a strong foundation to build on in 2025 and beyond."
* Blanco announced significant achievements, including the award of a 10-year $33 million contract with the US Coast Guard and the largest-ever order for MSA+ connected portables from a major North American energy customer. He added that connected portables were the fastest-growing category in 2024, with further growth anticipated in 2025.
* CFO Lee McChesney reported Q4 sales of $500 million, a 1% increase on a reported basis and 2% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin reached 24.0%, supported by effective SG&A management, price realization, and productivity programs. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.25, up 9% year-over-year.

### Outlook

* Management projects low single-digit organic sales growth for 2025, acknowledging challenging comparisons from the US Air Force order and backlog conversion in 2024. McChesney described the 2025 macroeconomic and geopolitical climate as "dynamic" but reiterated confidence in the business's resilience.
* McChesney provided additional modeling inputs, including a tax rate of 24%-25%, interest expense of $24 million to $27 million, and anticipated foreign exchange headwinds to reported sales. He stated, "We remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, which balances the opportunities and risks we see ahead of us."

### Financial Results

* Free cash flow for Q4 was $93 million, reflecting a conversion rate of 105%. Full-year free cash flow totaled $242 million. The year-end net debt was $343 million, with a net leverage ratio of 0.7 times.
* The Americas segment achieved a 1% increase in sales, with adjusted operating margin improving by 90 basis points to 30.7%. The International segment reported flat growth, with adjusted operating margin declining by 60 basis points to 17.6% due to inflationary pressures.

### Q&A

* Ross Sparenblek, William Blair: Asked about the order cadence moving into 2025 and the potential impact of the NFPA standard change on fire service orders. Steven Blanco responded that order pace year-to-date had been solid and aligned with expectations, despite a slower-than-anticipated December. Regarding the NFPA standard, Blanco noted that while some customers might defer orders, others would proceed based on their immediate needs.
* Saree Boroditsky, Jefferies: Inquired about margin potential in the Americas segment heading into 2025. McChesney emphasized a focus on achieving 30-50 basis points of improvement annually, particularly through gross margin enhancements.
* Jeff Van Sinderen, B. Riley FBR: Asked about product innovation in 2025 and its potential impact on detection demand. Blanco highlighted advancements in connected portables, fixed gas detection, and the next-generation G1 SCBA, which is scheduled for NFPA approval.
