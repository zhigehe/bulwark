Earnings Call Insights: Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:[CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc.")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* CEO Chuck Robbins highlighted strong fiscal Q2 performance with revenue, margins, and EPS above the high end of guidance ranges. He emphasized the company's AI infrastructure momentum, with year-to-date orders surpassing $700 million and a full-year target exceeding $1 billion. AI infrastructure orders with webscalers were a key driver, with triple-digit order growth from three of the top six webscalers.
* Robbins announced a $15 billion increase in share repurchase authorization and a $0.01 per share increase to the quarterly dividend, reflecting Cisco's commitment to returning value to shareholders.
* CFO Scott Herren reported Q2 revenue of $14 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.94. He noted double-digit growth in total product orders, driven by strong demand in Service Provider & Cloud and Enterprise segments, as well as a 117% growth in Security revenue, primarily supported by Splunk.

### Outlook

* Fiscal Q3 2025 revenue is guided to $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin expected between 67% and 68%, and non-GAAP EPS ranging from $0.90 to $0.92.
* Full-year fiscal 2025 revenue is projected in the range of $56 billion to $56.5 billion, with non-GAAP EPS guidance between $3.68 and $3.74.
* Management addressed potential impacts from proposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, building associated costs into the guidance while outlining mitigation strategies leveraging Cisco's global supply chain.

### Financial Results

* Total product revenue was $10.2 billion, growing 11% year-over-year, while service revenue reached $3.8 billion, up 6%.
* Security revenue surged 117%, supported by Splunk and newly refreshed firewall offerings. Excluding Splunk, Security grew 4%.
* Subscription revenue increased by 23% to $7.9 billion, representing 56% of total revenue. Total ARR reached $30.1 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase.
* Operating cash flow increased 177% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, driven by higher tax payments in the prior year.

### Q&A

* Simon Leopold, Raymond James, asked about federal exposure amid potential U.S. government layoffs. Robbins clarified that federal business represents less than 10% of Cisco's total operations, with 75% of that tied to the Department of Defense. While some deals faced initial delays, they are back on track.
* Ben Reitzes, Melius Research, inquired about the new programmable 9,300 Nexus switch. Robbins emphasized its innovation in integrating security into networks at ASIC speed and highlighted Hypershield as the first use case for this platform.
* Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan, questioned AI deployment momentum. Robbins noted enterprise customers are still in early stages but are increasingly investing in infrastructure to prepare for AI workloads.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on AI momentum, federal challenges, and product innovation. Questions were detailed and forward-looking, reflecting optimism tempered by macroeconomic concerns.
* Management's tone was confident during prepared remarks, emphasizing strong execution and innovation. During Q&A, responses were measured, with defensive undertones when addressing tariff impacts and U.S. federal business.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management exhibited increased confidence in AI-related opportunities and growth potential.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Management raised full-year revenue and EPS guidance compared to Q1. AI infrastructure orders accelerated, reaching $700 million year-to-date versus $300 million in Q1.
* Product order growth in Service Provider & Cloud jumped from 28% in Q1 to 75% in Q2, driven by webscale demand. Enterprise order growth normalized from 33% in Q1 to 27% in Q2.
* Analysts' questions shifted from backlog normalization concerns in Q1 to AI-driven demand and federal spending uncertainties in Q2.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted potential challenges from proposed tariffs, with mitigation strategies in place. Federal business delays remain a concern due to ongoing budgetary constraints.
* Analysts raised concerns about competitive pressures in the AI networking space, particularly from Nvidia.

### Final Takeaway

Cisco's Q2 2025 results showcased robust growth across key segments, driven by accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and strong subscription revenue. With a $1 billion AI order target for the fiscal year and expanded share repurchase programs, Cisco aims to sustain its momentum.
