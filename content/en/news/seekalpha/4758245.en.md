**Corsair Gaming, Inc.** (NASDAQ:[CRSR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRSR "Corsair Gaming, Inc.")), the gaming peripheral and component company, reported its Q4 results on the 12th of February after market close. The quarter’s results came in well above Wall Street expectations, again showing strong peripheral sales but component sales weakness ahead of Nvidia’s ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) 50-series GPU launch. With Nvidia’s GPU launch now supporting a recovery among other factors, Corsair finally guides very well-improving revenues for 2025, still leaving some concern over the performance in terms of guided margins.

In my previous [November 2024 article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4737211-corsair-gaming-stock-fanatec-refuels-growth-after-weak-q3-earnings) on the stock, “*Corsair Gaming: Fanatec To Refuel Growth After Weak Q3”*, I cautiously stayed at a Hold rating despite estimated upside in valuation due to remaining component sales uncertainty. With the market starting to price in a recovery beforehand, Corsair’s stock has returned 69% compared to S&P 500’s return of 1% after the article was published, including a 17% rally to the Q4 report at the time of writing as markets continue to weigh the performance.

My Rating History on CRSR (Seeking Alpha)





Corsair’s Q4 Was Good
---------------------

Corsair’s [Q4 results](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20000529-corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results) came in above expectations. Revenues came in at $413.6 million, still declining -0.9% year-on-year but showing significant stabilization compared to [previous quarters](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRSR/income-statement) that included double-digit percentage declines, and beating Wall Street’s [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407187-corsair-gaming-non-gaap-eps-of-0_23-beats-by-0_07-revenue-of-413_62m-beats-by-25_7m) by a notable $25.7 million margin. Again driving growth, the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment’s revenues grew 23.9% to $169.6 million, while Gaming Components and Systems revenues still declined -13.0% to $244.1 million in anticipation of Nvidia’s 50-series gaming GPUs.

CRSR Q4 Investor Presentation





With stable total sales, Corsair’s margin performance was also relatively stable. Gamer and Creator Peripheral segment gross margin rose 0.5 percentage points to 37.7% while the Gaming Components and Systems gross margin offset the expansion with a 0.4 percentage point decline, setting Corsair’s Q4 adjusted EBITDA at $33.1 million, declining just $0.6 million year-on-year against much weaker Wall Street expectations; the adjusted EPS of $0.23 beat Wall Street’s consensus by $0.07.

Against weak expectations, highlighted by Corsair’s adjusted EBITDA guidance cut with the [Q3 report](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19905979-corsair-gaming-reports-q3-2024-financial-results) and overall caution as the industry was still waiting for Nvidia’s 50-series GPUs, I believe that the performance was good. Notably, peripherals continued to show solid growth for example above Logitech’s ([LOGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOGI "Logitech International S.A.")) recent performance that I recently [wrote on](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753760-logitech-strong-q3-but-notable-currency-headwinds-ahead-rating-downgrade).

The 2025 Guidance Points to Stronger Sales, But Still Thin Margins
------------------------------------------------------------------

Corsair’s given 2025 guidance suggests a good recovery in the year. The company expects revenues of $1.4-1.6 billion against Wall Street’s consensus of $1.47 billion, showing a very slight beat and suggesting mid-point growth of 13.9% after the 2024 revenue decline. Adjusted EBITDA is expected at $80-100 million with the mid-point precisely at Wall Street’s $90 million consensus, and up significantly from $54.7 million in 2024.

The 2025 performance has many positive drivers ahead. Most notably, the 50-series Nvidia GPUs [started](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/96e0bff8-6030-4239-aed3-de05c7dcae76) shipping in late January with the high-end 5090 and 5080 cards, already likely contributing to a much greater Q1 performance in the previously weak Gaming Components and Systems segment. As other positive factors, the prior Fanatec acquisition will contribute to 2025 results for the full year, and notably, Corsair’s K65 keyboard and M75 gaming mouse were selected by Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) to be sold in the company’s stores as preferred gaming hardware.

On the other hand, still likely weighing on the 2025 sales performance, the US [consumer confidence](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence) has remained low, even declining in early 2025.

My opinion on the guidance is mixed. The guidance is mainly in line or even slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, but does still have quite a large range of potential outcomes in especially the earnings level. The guidance’s mid-point suggests an adjusted EBIT margin of just 5.1% with GAAP earnings likely to come even below the level, highlighting that Corsair still needs margin expansion beyond 2025 for more sustainable earnings. Growth in following years should still bring further operating leverage, but margins remain a concern for me.

Updated Valuation
-----------------

I updated my discounted cash flow (DCF) model for Corsair. I now estimate adjusted EBIT instead of GAAP figures, underlining the operative performance better.

The 2025 guidance is mainly in line with my previous expectations, and I estimate quite similar revenues – after estimating 2025 revenues of $1500 million at the guidance mid-point, I estimate a 2025-2034 CAGR of 4.8% afterwards and 2.5% perpetual growth after 2034.

With Corsair’s margins remaining thin, I estimate the adjusted EBIT margin to slowly reach a 7% level from 3.5% in 2024. Corsair’s long-term margin potential remains largely uncertain, and the estimate could still have either upside or downside in the future.

I expect Corsair to have quite moderate capital expenditures and minimal additional working capital requirements, but some adjusted expenses that slightly worsen the cash flow conversion from adjusted EBIT.

DCF Model (Author's Calculation)





The estimates put Corsair’s fair value estimate at $9.07, 22% below the stock price at the time of writing; as the stock has risen considerably after my previous article, I believe that the valuation is now quite unattractive. While the reported Q4 results and 2025 outlook raise the confidence in the DCF model’s expectations to be reached, the margin uncertainty makes the investment volatile. I still believe that the overvaluation falls within a margin of safety, though, as Corsair could prove better margin expansion in the long term than I currently anticipate, which could improve the fair value estimate considerably.

The fair value estimate compares to $8.92 previously.

CAPM
----

The DCF model uses a cost of capital [WACC] of 10.36%, derived from a capital asset pricing model:

 ![cost of capital corsair](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/52204265-1739463000542529.png) 



CAPM (Author's Calculation)





I estimate a 7.07% interest rate, annualized from the most recent quarter’s interest expenses and debt. I slightly lowered my debt-to-equity ratio estimate to 15% due to Corsair’s now higher equity valuation.

For cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond [yield of 4.54%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y?s=us10y) as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.33% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s most recent January [estimate](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html) for the US. Seeking Alpha now estimates Corsair’s beta at 1.45. With a liquidity premium of 0.3%, the cost of equity stands at 11.12% and the WACC at 10.36%.

Takeaway
--------

Corsair’s Q4 financials were better than expected, with peripherals continuing to grow well and component sales starting to stabilize. Looking forward, the Nvidia 50-series launch, Apple collaboration, and Fanatec acquisition look to bolster a recovery with Corsair guiding good 2025 revenue growth. While the company also guides some margin expansion, the expected margin level is still thin, and the overall margin level remains a concern for me. With a valuation that reflects already good earnings growth expectations, I remain at a neutral Hold rating for Corsair, but note the stock's quite unattractive valuation.
