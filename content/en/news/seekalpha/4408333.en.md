Earnings Call Insights: Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:[DLR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLR "Digital Realty Trust, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Andy Power highlighted 2024 as a "breakout year" with the company achieving over $1 billion in bookings, including nearly $250 million in the 0 to 1 megawatt interconnection category. He noted record lease renewal activity approaching $1 billion, with cash rents rolling up 9% on average. The global portfolio was expanded by over 200 megawatts, with a development pipeline scaling by over 75% to $7 billion in projects, 70% of which are pre-leased.
* New products and services launched include high-density Colo 2.0, supporting up to 150 kilowatts per rack, the expansion of ServiceFabric to 38 metros globally, and the introduction of Private AI Exchange, an open platform integrating AI capabilities.
* CFO Matt Mercier reported that leverage was reduced to 4.8 times, supported by over $2 billion raised in debt and equity capital, along with $500 million from asset sales and joint ventures. Core FFO grew by 6% year-over-year to $1.73 per share. He emphasized strong leasing results, particularly in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which hit a record $76 million in bookings.

### Outlook

* The company set its 2025 core FFO guidance at $7.05-$7.15 per share, representing 5.7% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA and total revenue are expected to grow over 10% on a normalized basis.
* Same capital cash NOI is projected to grow 3.5%-4.5%. CapEx net of partner contributions is expected to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, with gross CapEx at $4.5 billion. Development yields are anticipated to remain in double digits.

### Financial Results

* Q4 leasing activity totaled $100 million, with the 0 to 1 megawatt segment contributing $76 million, a 16% sequential increase. Greater than 1 megawatt bookings contributed $23 million, primarily from EMEA and APAC regions.
* Full-year 2024 core FFO per share reached $6.75, with data center revenue growing 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7.4%, supported by rent escalations and new lease commencements. Same capital cash NOI increased 2.8% for the year.
* The backlog of booked but not yet billed leases stood at $797 million at year-end, with $400 million set to commence in 2025 and $300 million already slated for 2026.

### Q&A

* David Barden, Bank of America, asked about the impact of AI and hyperscaler investments on Digital Realty's outlook. CTO Chris Sharp noted that AI is driving higher utilization across customer segments, including private AI, with the company positioned to support high-density compute requirements.
* Richard Choe, JPMorgan, inquired about the cash renewal guidance of 4%-6% for 2025. CEO Power clarified that this figure excludes packaged deals that drove 2024 renewals to 9%. While current expiring rates remain elevated, mark-to-market opportunities are expected to improve in future years.
* Irvin Liu, Evercore ISI, questioned whether the $1 billion annual bookings rate was repeatable. CEO Power explained that while the 0 to 1 megawatt category has ample capacity for continued growth, greater than 1 megawatt bookings may be more dependent on specific development timelines.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the sustainability of leasing momentum and the long-term growth trajectory. Concerns were raised about potential lumpiness in hyperscale bookings and power availability in key markets.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing record lease activity, robust development pipelines, and financial flexibility. CEO Power highlighted strong execution and reiterated confidence in accelerating growth.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained consistent, while analysts showed increased interest in AI-related demand and its implications for development yields.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 core FFO increased to $7.05-$7.15 per share, up from the prior quarter’s full-year 2024 guidance of $6.65-$6.75 per share.
* Leasing activity in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment grew 16% sequentially, while greater than 1 megawatt bookings declined from Q3’s record levels.
* Development yields in the Americas improved to 13.7%, compared to 12% the previous quarter.
* Analysts’ focus shifted from the record third-quarter leasing activity to the sustainability of growth and the impact of AI demand.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged ongoing challenges in sourcing power and managing supply chain constraints. CTO Sharp emphasized the need for modular and scalable solutions to address evolving AI workload requirements.
