Investment Thesis
-----------------

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:[QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")) shares have fallen off over the last week after earnings were reported last Wednesday and a few components of the report missed analyst expectations. Personally, I actually found this quarter to be strong and impressive. I think it lays a great foundation for the company for the remainder of 2025. Really, what we are beginning to see is the future of portable AI. Qualcomm is one of the first firms to figure out that AI will be at the edge of a computer network (on IOT devices and smartphones). With this, special chips will need to be designed and manufactured to support a world of edge computing. Qualcomm is here to benefit from it.

I found growth to be strong in all divisions, and I see a future where more powerful local LLMs need Qualcomm chips.

With this, I continue to be a strong buy on shares despite the market's pessimism.

Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage
--------------------------------

Since I last wrote on the chip giant back in November, shares have slightly [trailed](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735755-qualcomm-stock-q4-earnings-game-changing-ai-results "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735755-qualcomm-stock-q4-earnings-game-changing-ai-results") the broader market. Year to date, shares have outperformed, up 10.85% not including dividends. I think the market is starting to appreciate the potential growth thesis here. The key trends are moving in Qualcomm's favor.

While a lot of this article talks about their FY Q1 earnings, I think what's key is that we need to look at what management's plans are carefully. This analysis (and the evidence from the Q1 call) is so much bigger than the first quarter performance. This is about investors picking up on the very beginning of the edge computing AI trend. This is going to help Qualcomm immensely over the next 5 years.

While I'll dive into the numbers Qualcomm posted this quarter, I think the big point was that the quarter was overall pretty solid. Some analysts may be a little more bearish than I am. For me, this is a buying opportunity. These analysts are too focused on the short term.

With this, I am doing follow-up coverage to show investors how we are at the beginning of a sea change of AI compute locations. This will have a profound effect on networks and Qualcomm.

Portable AI Is Here
-------------------

In the last few weeks, I have written extensively about the sudden rise of the new more efficient AI models like the Chinese AI model DeepSeek (Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")). DeepSeek has changed the game because it has some novel architecture that can compress complex AI models into smaller compute. Qualcomm is an obvious winner from this (in my opinion). Models like DeepSeek make AI more portable.

Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon explained this idea on last Wednesday's [earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript").

> Our advanced connectivity, computing, and edge AI technologies in product portfolio continue to be highly differentiated and increasingly relevant to a broad range of industries, Amon [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript").
> 
> We also remain very optimistic about the growing edge AI opportunity across our business, particularly as we see the next cycle of AI innovation and scale. DeepSeek-R1 and other similar models recently demonstrated the AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable and efficient, and now able to run directly on device. In fact, DeepSeek-R1 distilled models were running on Snapdragon powered smartphones and PCs within just a few days of its release.
> 
> As we entered the era of AI inference, we expect that while training will continue in the cloud, inference will run increasingly on-device, making AI more accessible, customizable, and efficient, Amon [noted](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript").
> 
> This will encourage the development of more targeted, purpose-oriented models and applications, which we anticipate will drive increased adoption and in turn demand for Qualcomm platforms across a range of devices. With the industry's most powerful and efficient AI processors for the edge, we're well positioned to drive this transition and benefit from this upcoming inflection point.

While Apple Intelligence, the recent AI tool released by Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) for its latest iPhone, has not lived up to [expectations](https://www.idropnews.com/opinion/why-apple-intelligence-is-not-as-impressive-as-many-expected/233515/ "https://www.idropnews.com/opinion/why-apple-intelligence-is-not-as-impressive-as-many-expected/233515/"), I think in the long run AI on smartphones is going to help make consumers' lives easier. Already, NIH [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144349/#:~:text=Smartphone%2Dbased%20AI%20screening%20by,have%20access%20to%20primary%20care. "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144349/#:~:text=Smartphone%2Dbased%20AI%20screening%20by,have%20access%20to%20primary%20care.") show that putting AI models on smartphones for community health-screenings improves patient outcomes.

And this was before more powerful local models like DeepSeek came out.

The value proposition is here. Smartphone companies will pay up for more AI mobile chips. In fact, we are already seeing this in the Q1 data.

Q1 Review
---------

Again, while this is not a Q1 review of the chipmaker, I do want to dive into earnings because I think this is the strongest hint, yet, that Portable AI is here. Qualcomm absolutely blew out its expectations in both the EPS and revenue metrics in Q1. The company posted an EPS of [$3.41](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755313-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript"), which outperformed the expectation of $2.99 by $0.42. Qualcomm outperformed the EPS estimate by 14%.

In terms of revenue, Qualcomm's estimate for Q1 was roughly $10.94 billion. However, Qualcomm beat this already high expectation by more than $730 million, posting a total revenue of roughly $11.67 billion.

In the chart [below](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404017-qualcomm-in-charts-automotive-grows-most-yy-among-qct-revenue-streams-in-fq1 "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404017-qualcomm-in-charts-automotive-grows-most-yy-among-qct-revenue-streams-in-fq1"), I think it's easy to see that Qualcomm is seeing its revenue in the two key areas where I think portable AI is going to be most pronounced. For me, portable AI is more than just smartphones. Its complex AI models can do key inferencing with just local compute. This applies to IOT devices and smartphones. Growth in both of these areas has accelerated significantly since late 2023.

Qualcomm Growth History (Seeking Alpha)





Overall, growth is increasing (with the exception of auto, but this was only a minor slowdown). IOT and mobile are the key ones. Overall, these three categories combined account for $9 billion of the $11.67 billion that Qualcomm booked in Q1.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/qualcomm-shares-fall-licensing-business-forecasts-disappoints-2025-02-06/#:~:text=Feb%206%20%28Reuters%29%20%2D%20Shares,for%20quarterly%20sales%20and%20profit.

Valuation
---------

While portable AI is starting to accelerate Qualcomm's business, their forward Non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is still well below the sector median. Currently, the sector median for this metric is [25.37](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics"), but Qualcomm's P/E ratio is down at [14.70](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics"). This is a [42.06%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics") discount to the sector median. Seeking Alpha Quant gives Qualcomm a valuation grade of an [A-](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/valuation/metrics") in this area.

But as I've already discussed, I think the growth for the company in the future is really inevitable at this point. Wall Street sees this too. Qualcomm's forward revenue and EPS growth numbers are both significantly above the sector median.

Qualcomm has a forward revenue growth percentage of [8.10%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/growth "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/growth"), which is 32.71% higher than the sector median of 6.10%. Seeking Alpha Quant gives the company a [B-](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/growth "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM/growth") on this growth metric.

With forward EPS diluted growth, Qualcomm's project growth of 13.34% YoY is 44.21% higher than the sector median of 9.25%. Seeking Alpha Quant also gives the company a B- grade on this metric.

In essence, I think Wall Street is too bearish on shares. In my opinion, shares should converge on the sector median forward P/E of 25.37. If we saw shares converge on this ratio, up from 14.70, this would represent about 25.88% upside.

Risks
-----

I think the biggest risk for Qualcomm at this point comes from its revenue exposure to China. I wrote about this in my [last article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735755-qualcomm-stock-q4-earnings-game-changing-ai-results "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735755-qualcomm-stock-q4-earnings-game-changing-ai-results"), but now that we're a few weeks into Donald Trump's tenure as the 47th President, we have a better view on what his chip policy will be. The market continues to believe there is a risk he bans a larger swath of US AI related chips. I disagree.

During my last coverage, I was concerned because Qualcomm earned a large chunk (over 60% of its revenue in recent quarters has come from China). And with Trump being the President-elect at the time of my last writing, I was concerned about the proposed tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from China.

Now that Trump is President, he recently announced a [10% tariff on all goods imported from China](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/ "https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/"). On the surface, this could seem alarming for a company like Qualcomm that depends on revenue from China.

However, I'm reiterating from my last article that I do not believe that these chips will get an export ban from Trump. Even the best AI chips on smartphones cannot do what high-end GPUs (like NVIDIA's ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) can do, so the U.S. Government does not have an incentive to ban these.

In fact, some policy research argues that Trump chip tariffs or bans could actually benefit [Qualcomm](https://cepa.org/article/chip-wars-how-to-trump-china/ "https://cepa.org/article/chip-wars-how-to-trump-china/"):

> ...targeted bans could be effective. Any smartphone with a camera containing a Chinese-designed system-on-chip (the control center for the camera) represents a potential [security threat](https://cepa.org/article/the-chinese-communist-trojan-horses-in-our-cctv/ "https://cepa.org/article/the-chinese-communist-trojan-horses-in-our-cctv/"). This policy would target HiSilicon, the chip division of Huawei, and any brand using Chinese chip systems, while benefiting US leaders Qualcomm and Apple who design their own smartphone chips.

Bottom Line
-----------

While Wall Street has become increasingly bearish on Qualcomm since Q1 earnings were reported, I, on the other hand, am still bullish on the company. I liked what I saw in edge computing. I continue to fundamentally believe Qualcomm has it figured out. The company really knows where edge computing is going from here. They're building the groundwork for the next generation of Edge computing.

With this, I continue to believe shares are a strong buy despite some pessimism from analysts.
