### Management View

* CEO Tony Xu highlighted DoorDash's significant growth opportunities, stating that the company is still at a single-digit penetration in the U.S. restaurant industry and even smaller globally. Xu emphasized the potential for scaling grocery, retail, and commerce platform categories, while continuing to enhance product quality, speed, and affordability.
* Xu pointed out that international markets, including Wolt, are growing faster than peers and gaining market share in nearly every country of operation. The international portfolio remains gross profit positive, with opportunities to scale and improve unit economics.
* Xu discussed advancements in grocery delivery, noting that customers ordering groceries through DoorDash have shown increased spending and higher retention. He emphasized grocery delivery as a significant growth area, with a shift from small, top-up orders to larger baskets over time.
* CFO Ravi Inukonda noted, "The international portfolio is gross profit positive," and highlighted efficiency gains in logistics as a driver for profitability. He also emphasized the importance of scaling operations in international markets and new verticals.

### Outlook

* Xu outlined plans to continue investing in five key areas: U.S. restaurants, international markets, non-restaurant verticals, the commerce platform, and advertising. He emphasized the importance of reinvesting in existing areas with long growth runways while exploring future opportunities in local commerce.
* Xu stated that DoorDash remains focused on building a strong ads business, balancing advertiser needs with consumer experience. The company aims to improve ad relevance and expand product offerings.
* Inukonda reiterated that DoorDash operates with a flexible investment philosophy, prioritizing unit economic efficiency and reinvesting savings into growth initiatives.

### Financial Results

* DashPass subscriptions surpassed 18 million members, marking an all-time high. The program continues to grow through enhanced product benefits and partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Lyft.
