Earnings Call Insights: Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:[ATOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATOM "Atomera Incorporated")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Scott Bibaud highlighted significant progress across customer categories, emphasizing advancements in artificial intelligence ([AI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI "C3.ai, Inc.")) and gate-all-around transistor technologies. He noted that MST technology is positioned to deliver critical performance improvements for advanced semiconductor architectures and memory markets, valued at $150 billion and $125 billion, respectively, in 2023-2024.
* A stalled negotiation with a transformative customer was disclosed, but the company remains optimistic, citing MST’s ability to deliver up to two generations of performance improvement.
* Bibaud shared customer updates, including STMicro’s strong progress toward process qualification, expected to take about nine months from its start. Additionally, two transformative customers have initiated demo wafer runs, marking major milestones.
* CFO Frank Laurencio reported 2024 revenue at $135,000, with a GAAP net loss of $18.4 million or $0.68 per share. Operating expenses declined year-over-year due to reduced R&D and sales costs. Cash and short-term investments stood at $26.8 million as of December 31, 2024, bolstered by $21.3 million in net proceeds from share sales.

### Outlook

* The company expects its 2025 non-GAAP operating expenses to range between $17 million and $18 million, reflecting planned investments in engineering services and headcount.
* Management shared their anticipation of significant opportunities in AI infrastructure through gate-all-around and memory technologies. Additionally, MST’s application in Gallium Nitride (GaN) markets, projected to grow at over 26% annually to $12 billion in five years, was emphasized as a potential fast-revenue pathway.
* No revenue guidance was provided for Q1 2025, though wafer run revenues may materialize later in the year.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue was $23,000, slightly above Q3’s $22,000. The GAAP net loss for Q4 was $4.7 million or $0.16 per share, compared to $4.6 million in Q3.
* Operating expenses in Q4 stood at $4.9 million, reflecting modest sequential and year-over-year declines. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were $15.4 million, down from $17.1 million in 2023.
* Cash burn totaled $13.2 million for 2024, with $3 million used in Q4. Share sales raised $12.8 million in the quarter at an average price of $5.92 per share.

### Q&A

* Richard Shannon, Craig Hallum, asked about the stalled transformative customer negotiation. CEO Bibaud confirmed the issues were not technological but involved internal decision-making at the customer’s end, adding that MST demonstrated excellent value.
* Shannon inquired about advanced node opportunities. Bibaud highlighted the growing traction in gate-all-around due to MST’s seamless integration into Epi steps and its ability to address industry challenges in yield and performance.
* Cody Acree, Benchmark, asked about prioritization across the company’s diverse opportunities. Bibaud explained that STMicro remains a key focus, while GaN and advanced memory markets are rapidly gaining momentum.
* Shannon also asked about progress in RF-SOI. Bibaud noted ongoing work with Soitec and RF-SOI customers, emphasizing challenges related to thinner wafer technologies.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about the pace of customer adoption and delays in transformative negotiations but showed optimism regarding MST’s applications in advanced nodes and GaN.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly when discussing STMicro’s progress and MST’s alignment with AI infrastructure needs. However, they were defensive when addressing delays, citing external factors and emphasizing potential future progress.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was consistent, but analysts appeared slightly more skeptical regarding timelines and execution.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted to emphasize GaN and advanced node opportunities as faster paths to revenue compared to legacy nodes.
* Analysts focused on transformative customers and pipeline conversion, a change from Q3’s emphasis on RF-SOI and memory.
* Management’s confidence in AI-driven opportunities remained high, but challenges in negotiating terms with major customers were more pronounced this quarter.
* Financial metrics showed slight sequential increases in revenue and expenses, with cash reserves significantly strengthened through equity sales.

### Risks and Concerns

* Negotiations with a transformative customer have stalled, highlighting potential challenges in customer adoption of MST technology.
* The timeline for STMicro’s process qualification remains uncertain, with delays in tool installation cited as a prior setback.
* Analysts expressed concerns about slower-than-expected adoption of MST in legacy nodes and RF-SOI markets.
* Management plans to mitigate risks through focused investments in headcount and engineering services while emphasizing GaN as a faster-to-market opportunity.

### Final Takeaway

Atomera Incorporated continues to position itself as a key player in the semiconductor industry, leveraging MST technology to address challenges in AI, advanced nodes, and memory markets. While delays with transformative customers and legacy nodes present risks, progress with STMicro, exciting GaN opportunities, and strengthened financials underscore its long-term growth potential. The company remains focused on securing production milestones and expanding its presence in high-growth markets like AI and GaN.
