* Anywhere Real Estate [press release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001299-anywhere-real-estate-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results) (NYSE:[HOUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOUS "Anywhere Real Estate Inc.")): Q4 GAAP EPS of -$0.58  misses by $0.27.
* Revenue of $1.36B (+8.8% Y/Y)  beats by $80M.
* Operating EBITDA of $52 million, up $24 million year-over-year.
* Combined closed transaction volume increased 13% year-over-year with units up about 3% and price up 9%.
* **2025 Financial Estimates**
  
  The Company expects to realize further cost savings of approximately $100 million in 2025, which we expect will be offset in part by inflationary pressures and investments as we look to make significant progress transforming our business.
  
  The Company expects Operating EBITDA for full year 2025 to be about $350 million. The largest variable in this estimate is the performance of the housing market. The Company expects normal seasonal volumes throughout the year.
  
  The Company expects its Free Cash Flow excluding one-time items to be similar to 2024. Free cash flow, like Operating EBITDA, is driven by the overall housing market and may be impacted by additional investments we make to drive growth and advance our technology strategy.
