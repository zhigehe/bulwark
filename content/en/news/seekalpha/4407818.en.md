Earnings Call Insights: Walker & Dunlop (NYSE:[WD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WD "Walker & Dunlop, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Willy Walker highlighted that the company closed $13.4 billion in total transaction volume for Q4, marking a 45% year-over-year increase. Diluted earnings per share rose 42% to $1.32, driven by a 62% growth in revenues from mortgage servicing rights. Adjusted EBITDA reached $95 million, reflecting an 8% year-over-year rise, while adjusted core EPS was down 6% at $1.34.
* Walker & Dunlop remained Fannie Mae's largest Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) partner for the sixth consecutive year, with $3.2 billion in Fannie Mae lending, up 91% year-over-year. Freddie Mac loan originations grew 19%, reaching $1.6 billion for the quarter.
* Property sales transactions increased 20% year-over-year to $3.5 billion in Q4. The company’s Small Balance Lending and Appraisal businesses also showed strong performance, with Small Balance Lending revenues growing 20% year-over-year.
* CFO Greg Florkowski stated, "The surge in transaction activity drove year-over-year and sequential growth in nearly every area of our business, including the highest quarterly diluted earnings per share since The Great Tightening began in 2022."
* Management announced the creation of a new Special Asset Management group to address buybacks of several loans from GSEs. This group will focus on recovering value from these assets while implementing stricter process controls to prevent future issues.

### Outlook

* Walker & Dunlop expects diluted EPS growth in the high single to double digits for 2025, while adjusted EBITDA and adjusted core EPS are projected to be flat to up in the high single digits. Capital Markets is anticipated to drive growth, while recurring revenues in the Servicing and Asset Management ([SAM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAM "The Boston Beer Company, Inc.")) segment may experience slower increases.
* Management noted that $1 trillion in commercial real estate debt maturing in 2025 could influence market activity. The Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts a 16% growth in commercial real estate financing volume for 2025.
* CEO Walker indicated optimism for growth in transaction volumes across debt financing, equity placement, and investment sales. He added that stabilized interest rates and a narrowing bid-ask spread could unlock additional market activity.

### Financial Results

* EPS for Q4 stood at $1.32 vs. analysts’ estimate of $1.51. Total transaction volume for the year reached $40 billion, a 21% increase over 2023.
* Revenues from the SAM segment grew 13% year-over-year to $157 million in Q4, while Capital Markets revenues surged 40% to $181 million. Operating margins in the Capital Markets segment improved, with net income up 131% year-over-year to $40 million.
* A $13 million downward adjustment in affordable housing realization revenues and $8 million in repurchase-related expenses impacted results. However, these were offset by a $16 million benefit from earn-out adjustments.
* The company increased its quarterly dividend for the seventh consecutive year to $0.67 per share, reflecting a 3% rise.

### Q&A

* Jade Rahmani, KBW: Asked about potential partnerships with asset managers to drive fee revenue. CEO Walker responded that while the company has strong independent capabilities, partnerships remain a possibility.
* Steve DeLaney, Citizens JMP: Inquired about Fannie Mae’s strong Q4 performance. Walker clarified that the volume increase came from standard deal flow rather than mega deals, despite some pricing pressures on servicing fees.
* Jay McCanless, Wedbush: Questioned whether higher rates have shifted market dynamics. Walker stated that refinancing opportunities are becoming more prevalent as some borrowers cannot transition from floating to fixed-rate loans without additional equity.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analyst sentiment was slightly positive, with questions focusing on strategic growth areas and mitigation plans for credit risks. Analysts also displayed interest in competitive positioning, particularly regarding partnerships and GSE performance.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic initiatives and market positioning. In Q&A exchanges, the tone was pragmatic but optimistic, reflecting confidence in navigating market challenges.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone showed increased optimism due to improved transaction volumes and strategic expansions, while analysts maintained a consistent focus on probing for risks and growth drivers.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 guidance showed increased confidence, with high single to double-digit EPS growth forecasted for 2025, compared to Q3’s mid-single to low-teens range.
* Transaction volumes increased sequentially from $11.6 billion in Q3 to $13.4 billion in Q4. Property sales volumes grew 20% in Q4, compared to a 44% increase in Q3.
* Management sentiment improved, with a stronger emphasis on growth opportunities, including international expansion and new business verticals.
* Analysts’ concerns in Q4 focused more on long-term strategic growth rather than immediate macroeconomic pressures, marking a shift in focus from Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Loan buybacks and associated expenses due to underwriting errors or fraud were highlighted as key risks. Management has implemented new controls and established a Special Asset Management group to mitigate these risks.
* Potential volatility in interest rates and its impact on refinancing and transaction volumes remain a concern.
* Analysts raised questions about competitive dynamics in GSE lending and the scalability of new growth initiatives, including the hospitality vertical and European expansion.

### Final Takeaway

Walker & Dunlop demonstrated strong transaction growth and market leadership in Q4, with robust contributions from Fannie Mae lending and property sales. Management outlined a promising outlook for 2025, driven by anticipated transaction recovery and strategic expansions into new verticals and geographies. However, risks related to loan buybacks and interest rate volatility require careful navigation. The company’s commitment to growth through innovation and expanded offerings positions it well for the coming year.
