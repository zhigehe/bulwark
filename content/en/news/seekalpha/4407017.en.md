Earnings Call Insights: Agree Realty Corporation (NYSE:[ADC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADC "Agree Realty Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Joey Agree, CEO, emphasized the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and its strategic focus on investing in high-quality retail properties. He highlighted a strong start to 2025 with January performance aligning with expectations and reaffirmed investment guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the year.
* The CEO detailed proactive steps taken to strengthen the balance sheet, including $1.1 billion in forward equity raised in 2024, with $423 million in Q4 alone, and a liquidity position exceeding $2 billion. He underscored that this provides ample capacity to meet 2025 investment goals without requiring additional equity capital.
* CEO Agree stated, "We are confident in achieving our AFFO per share guidance of $4.26 to $4.30 for 2025," representing a 3.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, despite anticipated treasury stock method dilution of $0.01 to $0.02.
* CFO Peter Coughenour highlighted the company’s BBB+ credit rating upgrade by S&P and stated, "Pro forma net debt to recurring EBITDA stood at 3.3x, the lowest level in two years," reflecting improved leverage and capital efficiency.

### Outlook

* Agree Realty reaffirmed its full-year 2025 AFFO per share guidance of $4.26 to $4.30, projecting approximately 3.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
* The company provided an investment target of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for 2025, supported by its liquidity and balance sheet strength.
* Management noted the potential for this guidance to be conservative and committed to regular updates as visibility improves throughout the year.

### Financial Results

* Core FFO per share was $1.02 for Q4 and $4.08 for full-year 2024, reflecting 3.5% and 3.7% year-over-year increases, respectively.
* AFFO per share for Q4 reached $1.04, with full-year AFFO per share at $4.14, achieving the high end of guidance and growing 4.6% year-over-year.
* The company reported $371 million in Q4 investments across 127 retail properties, with a weighted average cap rate of 7.3% and an average lease term of 12.3 years. For the full year, it invested $951 million in 282 properties.
* Dispositions totaled $98 million for 2024, including $26 million in Q4, with a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%.

### Q&A

* Ki Bin Kim, Truist Securities, inquired about the potential for mark-to-market upside in ground leases. Joey Agree explained that such upside is case-dependent but cited a recent example where a lease renewal resulted in a significant rent increase.
* Smedes Rose, Citigroup, asked about the impact of treasury rate volatility on cap rates and seller expectations. Agree noted that volatility has not yet significantly reset seller expectations, though the company remains disciplined in capital deployment.
* Jenny Li, Morgan Stanley, questioned the sustainability of investment-grade tenant exposure. CEO Agree clarified that investment-grade exposure, currently at 68.2%, is an outcome of its strategy, but the company also values strong non-rated tenants like Aldi and Hobby Lobby.
* Michael Goldsmith, UBS, asked about the rationale behind increased auto parts exposure. Agree attributed this to secular trends such as aging vehicles and elevated repair demand, adding that auto parts stores align well with the company’s strategic focus on durable real estate.

* AFFO per share guidance for 2025 reflects similar growth expectations to the midpoint of the revised 2024 guidance.
* Management’s tone shifted from cautious optimism in Q3 to greater confidence in Q4, supported by improved leverage and liquidity.
* Analysts maintained a focus on tenant credit risks and potential headwinds from macroeconomic factors, consistent with Q3 concerns.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about the impact of treasury rate volatility on cap rates and acquisition opportunities. Management emphasized its disciplined approach to capital deployment and liquidity as mitigants.
