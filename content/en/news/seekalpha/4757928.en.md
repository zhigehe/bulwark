BING-JHEN HONG





**Nvidia Corporation** (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) stock has plunged from its all-time highs but is still trading near record highs. I have written many articles on the [subject of Nvidia](https://seekingalpha.com/author/anna-sokolidou/analysis?ticker=NVDA) and its extreme overvaluation. Also, I wrote that its delightful revenue and income growth rates did not seem sustainable. Given the recent news, I was right, it seems. With Nvidia [reporting earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings) soon on February 26th, let's take another look.

Nvidia's fall from grace
------------------------

On Monday, the 27th of January, Nvidia's market cap dropped like a stone as investors read the news that China's [DeepSeek](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398835-deepseek-ai-stock-price-china) ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) app was developed and so was its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1.

Data by YCharts



Investors were concerned that the DeepSeek app was more cost-efficient than its other competitors. Also, it was a signal to other companies, including Nvidia, that heavy spending may not be as necessary to satisfy their customers' needs.

As one of my fellow Seeking Alpha analysts, [The Oriental Trader,](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752230-will-deepseek-pop-the-nvidia-bubble) wrote,

> *"DeepSeek's success with limited resources suggests tech majors may reconsider massive AI spending, potentially reducing NVDA's bargaining power and long-term demand."*

This is a substantial threat because most analysts have recently linked Nvidia's growth outlook with massive AI spending by high-tech majors.

One of the threats to Nvidia's excellent growth has been competition. Despite the AI brilliant boom, there are tech majors that will also eat at least a part of Nvidia's pie. Some time ago, I wrote about Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) and Intel ([INTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC "Intel Corporation")) and their [rivalry with Nvidia](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4727961-nvidia-stock-extraordinary-growth-should-slowdown-despite-blackwell). But the Chinese AI market is also an issue.

One of the problems related to China is ignored by the market. Now that there is a trade war with China and many other countries, many high-tech companies face a serious threat related to their production facilities based in China. Due to the trade war, tariffs between the US and China are rising, and more is yet to come, it seems. You might be wondering how it could affect Nvidia. But China accounts for 20-25% of [Nvidia's data center revenue,](https://thechinaacademy.org/china-finally-losing-hope-in-nvidia/) its largest income source, and also a key figure for Nvidia's AI ambitions.

Stock analysis





Also, if we take a look at the graph above, we will see that China and Taiwan are accountable for $33.2 billion of the corporation's revenues. Taiwan has a strong connection with China, its biggest trading partner. [China sees Taiwan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59900139) as its breakaway province that will eventually get under Beijing's control. China's government does not exclude the use of force to take the island. Taiwan, however, sees itself as separate from the Chinese mainland. If the situation in Taiwan gets critical, Nvidia's revenues received from China and Taiwan will highly likely decrease. This is likely to happen also because Nvidia is an American corporation, while US-China relations are quite complicated now.

But the deteriorating relations between the US and China do not only amount to tariffs or purely political tensions. In response to [US tech curbs](https://thechinaacademy.org/china-finally-losing-hope-in-nvidia/), China initiated an Nvidia probe. In December last year, Nvidia was officially investigated for suspected [violations of China's anti-monopoly law](https://thechinaacademy.org/china-finally-losing-hope-in-nvidia/) and also for the corporation's decision to acquire Mellanox Technologies Ltd. But it seems to me that this is just the beginning of the trade war between the US and China affecting Nvidia.

Apart from the purely geopolitical risks, there is also surging competition. Not only DeepSeek but also Alibaba ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) and ByteDance ([BDNCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNCE "ByteDance")) come up with new models. Moreover, Nvidia's clients, including Amazon's ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) AWS, [are already using](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-r1-models-now-available-on-aws/) the DeepSeek-R1 model to increase their system's efficiency and give clients more choice. Then, Nvidia's customers like Amazon, Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")), and Google ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc."))([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) are inventing their own AI chips, which pose a direct competition for Nvidia's production. This is significant because these high-tech giants are accountable for over [40%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html) of Nvidia's revenue base. Even Nvidia's Jensen Huang has admitted the competitive threat from these new AI chips.

Obviously, it is in the best interests of Nvidia's customers to ensure efficiency. So, if their chips turn out to be cheaper than Nvidia's, they will produce their own instead of buying Nvidia's. Apart from Nvidia's sales, its profit margins will also decrease.

But why does it matter that much? AI chips are produced by the data center division. Most of the income and sales are generated precisely by this division.

Stock analysis





As can be seen from the diagram above, since 2023, Nvidia's data center division has been a major source of sales growth, substantially beating the gaming, professional visualization, automotive, and robotics as well as OEM divisions.

### Business outlook

Despite the current brilliant growth rate, Nvidia's business outlook is quite uncertain. By this, I mean that there is quite a big gap between low and high EPS estimates in the coming quarters. For example, for the 4Q 2026, analysts estimate the EPS will total between $0.91 and $1.82 per share.

**Nvidia's earnings estimates**

The same is true of its revenue figures, especially predicted for the same 4Q 2026.

Also, as can be seen from the diagram below, the forecasted EPS estimates suggest low earnings growth.

Below, I have prepared a table and a graph with Nvidia's quarterly sales and net income figures.

Overall, both the quarterly sales and the net income figures have been rising brilliantly since April 2023. At the same time, the EPS growth rate has slightly slowed down in the past two quarters.

But here is what the average expectations of Nvidia's EPS estimates are.

[![Nvidia EPS estimates](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/50290581-17393987746539607.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/50290581-17393987746539607_origin.png)

According to analysts' consensus estimates, EPS growth will slow down in the upcoming years. This is logical. As I have always mentioned before, brilliant EPS growth cannot last forever.

### Risks to my thesis

The risks to my thesis are substantial. First, stock price guessing is a hard game to play if we talk about a popular company like Nvidia. Its growth rate is difficult to forecast. Moreover, it is a strong company with brilliant intellectual property and competent management. It has a high credit rating, a sound [balance sheet](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet), and also sits on piles of cash, as I have mentioned in my previous articles.

But the most important upside risk is its popularity among investors. Even if some poor news likely to substantially affect Nvidia gets announced, then some analysts and investors will still consider this to be an opportunity to buy more shares at a wider margin of safety. However, Nvidia's margin of safety is very low, to say the least.

### Valuations

NVDA stock is much more costly than the sector's average. This is true for most of NVDA's indicators, including its P/E, EV/EBITDA, EVEV/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow ratios.

That being said, how high is NVDA stock price, and how high are its valuation ratios if we see the history?

![NVDA stock price](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/50290581-1739398775480728.png)



YCharts





The P/E ratio was at all-time highs at the end of 2023, nearing 240. Currently, it is lingering near 50, quite low for an overvalued stock like Nvidia. But still, according to the sector's averages, it is very high.

![Nvidia stock price](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/50290581-1739398775466041.png)



YCharts





The same is true of the company's EV-to-EBIT ratio of 44. It is low compared to the all-time high of 240, but still too high for the sector Nvidia operates in. As concerns Nvidia's stock price, it is lingering just slightly off its highs, but is still too expensive.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, I would say that Nvidia, despite being a brilliant company, faces plenty of competitive threats not only due to DeepSeek but also due to its customers, the tech majors. The growing tensions between the US and China are also among the risks. Nvidia's EPS growth rate shows signs of a slowdown, while its stock price is lingering near its multi-year highs.
