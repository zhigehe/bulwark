Biophytis SA ([OTCPK:BPTSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPTSY "Biophytis S.A.")) Tuesday unveiled its strategic outlook for the year and said that 2025 will be decisive for the company, with several major initiatives to accelerate the clinical development of BIO101 (20-Hydroxyecdysone) and its commercialization.

Biophytis will actively pursue agreements and collaborations in the Americas, Europe and Asia, in order to expand its presence in key indications, notably obesity and sarcopenia, [the company said.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997513-biophytis-unveils-its-outlook-strategies-for-2025 "the company said.")

Biophytis ([OTCPK:BPTSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPTSY "Biophytis S.A.")) will also initiate the Phase 2 OBA study for BIO101 (20-Hydroxyecdysone) in obesity, in collaboration with Blanver and other potential partners.

This study will evaluate the efficacy of BIO101 (20-Hydroxyecdysone) in obese patients treated with GLP-1 RAs and following a hypocaloric diet.

Finally, Biophytis plans to launch phase 3 of its SARA clinical program in the coming months, aimed at confirming the efficacy of BIO101 (20-Hydroxyecdysone) in sarcopenia.
