Investment environment
----------------------

Small- and mid-cap stocks rose along with the broader equity market in the fourth quarter, supported by positive economic news. The November election sparked a speculative rally that was fueled by expectations for lower corporate tax rates and decreased regulation under the Trump administration. Stocks encountered volatility in December, while investors paid renewed attention to individual company fundamentals. The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut policy rates by 25 basis points but signaled fewer rate cuts were likely in 2025. The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y)) ended the quarter sharply higher on increased economic growth and inflation expectations.

Portfolio review
----------------

Relative performance was hindered by the portfolio’s lack of exposure to several small- and mid-cap stocks that were notable beneficiaries of the November rally. This rally favored more speculative, often unprofitable companies over the profitable companies we own. This dynamic was similar to what we saw in 2016, when our strategy underperformed in an initial low-quality rally sparked by Trump’s election.

This indiscriminate rally soon gave way to a renewed focus on individual company fundamentals that worked to our strengths as bottom-up stock pickers. We started to see the same shift this December, as investor euphoria turned to more nuanced assessment of opportunity and risk, especially as investors started to assess how Trump’s actual policies might impact individual companies. This return to fundamentals led to our relative outperformance for the month of December, which helped to offset some of our November underperformance.

Among stocks we owned, Teleflex ([TFX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TFX "Teleflex Incorporated")) was a relative detractor. Teleflex supplies medical devices used in diagnostic and surgical applications. Earnings growth disappointed in the third quarter as the company continued to experience headwinds for its core product, UroLift, a treatment for benign prostate hyperplasia. Teleflex suffered another setback after losing a key customer for its outsourced manufacturing business. While we were disappointed with these results, we remain invested in Teleflex as we believe Wall Street is too myopically focused on UroLift, while not giving the company enough credit for the good performance in the remaining 90% of its business.

[WEX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEX "WEX Inc."), another detractor, issues credit cards that manage fleet fuel costs. Returns from this business were weaker than anticipated, as fewer fleet miles driven in the third quarter resulted in lower fuel surcharges. The company’s cloud- based corporate travel business also faced uncertainty after a contract renegotiation with a large customer resulted in near-term earnings headwinds due to some of the processing volume being taken in-house. We continue to like the company for its diversified business model and strong competitive position.

LPL Financial ([LPLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LPLA "LPL Financial Holdings Inc.")) was a relative contributor. As one of the large independent broker dealers in the U.S., LPL provides a full- service, technology-enabled investment platform that helps independent financial advisors better serve clients and improve business returns. The company reported strong third-quarter results and increased guidance, assisted by robust market performance and increased assets under management. Additionally, investors responded favorably to the appointment of a new CEO, who presented a constructive outlook for the company. LPL Financial is also positioned to benefit from higher-for-longer interest rates through the sweep income it earns on client accounts.

Mirion Technologies ([MIR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MIR "Mirion Technologies, Inc.")), another contributor, is a key supplier of nuclear measurement instruments and detection systems critical to a number of industries including defense, power generation, and medical. Mirion’s market positioning and competitive advantages have helped support strong earnings growth. We see upside potential tied to growing demand for nuclear power generation, as data centers look to reduce their carbon footprints while meeting the power requirements of artificial intelligence.

Manager outlook
---------------

We remain constructive on the outlook for the small- and mid-cap markets even as we see the potential for volatility, especially as investors wait to see which proposals the Trump administration will be able to enact. Some policies, such as corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and a more accommodating environment for mergers and acquisitions, would be positive for smaller-cap companies, especially the kind of profitable, high-quality companies we own. Other proposed policies, if implemented, could have negative implications for certain industries, while tariffs could worsen inflation. Given these risks and recent Fed statements, we believe we could see interest rates remain higher in 2025 than investors were anticipating at the start of the fourth quarter. Longer-term yields have already moved higher on these expectations, which will have implications for corporate funding and balance sheets.

We also see the potential for volatility in the recent imbalances in the small- and mid-cap markets, where investors have favored speculative, often unprofitable companies with higher and higher valuations, even as they have disregarded other high-quality companies with proven business models, durable competitive advantages, and demonstrated earnings growth. We will seek to use potential market dislocations to our advantage. Our focus remains on well-managed growth companies with strong balance sheets, healthy free cash flows, and high returns on capital. We believe such companies can outperform over the long term, regardless of the economic backdrop.
