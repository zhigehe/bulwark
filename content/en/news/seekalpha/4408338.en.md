Earnings Call Insights: Air Lease Corporation (NYSE:[AL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AL "Air Lease Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO John Plueger reported quarterly revenues of $713M and diluted earnings per share of $0.83. Full-year 2024 revenue and fleet net book value reached record highs. The company added $1.3B in flight equipment by purchasing 18 new aircraft and generated $540M from the sale of 14 aircraft.
* Plueger highlighted that approximately $5B in deliveries were completed in 2024, hitting the midpoint of earlier guidance. For 2025, the company expects aircraft deliveries worth $3.0B to $3.5B, primarily from its Boeing order book. Approximately 80% of 2025 deliveries will be Boeing aircraft.
* Plueger noted that strong lease rates in Q4 were achieved even during lease extensions, a rarity in the industry. He also emphasized the company's reduced dependence on debt funding for 2025, forecasting $2B in debt financing needs, including refinancing.
* Executive Chairman Steven Hazy pointed to exceptional demand for wide-body aircraft, with lease rates now rivaling narrow-body demand. Hazy also highlighted the long-term value of Air Lease's order book, secured at discounted rates in prior years.
* CFO Gregory Willis reported $65M in quarterly gains from aircraft sales, representing a 14% gain-on-sale margin. He also confirmed a decline in the composite cost of funds to 4.14% and highlighted a newly-launched $2B commercial paper program to reduce borrowing costs.

### Outlook

* The company expects $3.0B to $3.5B in aircraft deliveries in 2025, with around $8B projected for Q1. Approximately 80% of these deliveries are Boeing aircraft, potentially impacted by production challenges.
* Plueger outlined priorities for 2025, including achieving a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5:1 by year-end, with debt reduction taking precedence over other capital allocation avenues.
* Lease yields are anticipated to grow steadily over the next three to four years, supported by strong lease extension rates and the roll-off of COVID-era leases by 2026.

### Financial Results

* Revenues for Q4 2024 were $713M, compared to analysts' estimates of $703.2M. Adjusted EPS of $0.83 was higher than the $0.75 estimated by analysts.
* The company's fleet utilization rate remained at 100%, with a stable average fleet age of 4.6 years.
* Total sales proceeds for the quarter amounted to $540M, with gains reflecting robust demand for aircraft.
* Interest expense increased by $38M year-over-year, primarily due to a higher composite cost of funds. However, the company benefited from declining rates following Federal Reserve cuts.

### Q&A

* Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs, questioned the timeline for achieving mid-teen pre-tax ROEs. Plueger estimated it would take two to three years and highlighted factors like lease rates and interest rates as key variables.
* Terry Ma, Barclays, sought clarity on net spread margins amid rising lease yields. Willis confirmed that margins for 2025 are expected to remain flat but should improve over time as lease yields continue their steady rise.
* Jamie Baker, JPMorgan, asked about expanding aircraft sales to enhance equity value. Plueger stated that the company plans to maintain sales levels around $1.5B annually, although larger portfolio sales could be considered if compelling opportunities arise.
* Stephen Trent, Citi, inquired about supply normalization. Plueger affirmed that aircraft shortages are likely to persist for several years, with OEMs struggling to ramp up production.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, frequently probing the company's ability to sustain lease rate growth and ROE improvements. Concerns centered on external risks like interest rates and supply chain disruptions.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing the strength of the current demand environment and the company's positioning. Plueger noted, "We are confident about lease rate extensions at significantly higher lease rates."
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone reflected growing confidence in lease rate dynamics and strategic execution.
* Analysts' sentiment remained steady, with a focus on operational resilience and financial strategy.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance was revised downward for 2025 aircraft deliveries to $3.0B-$3.5B, compared to $4.5B-$5.5B in 2024. However, management emphasized the ability to self-fund deliveries.
* Strategic focus shifted from aggressive fleet expansion to achieving optimal debt-to-equity ratios and maximizing lease rate yields.
* Analysts maintained a consistent focus on lease yields, capital allocation, and the impact of supply constraints.
* Management's confidence in navigating supply chain challenges and capitalizing on strong lease demand has remained consistent.

### Risks and Concerns

* Plueger acknowledged that Boeing production challenges could impact 2025 deliveries. "Any additional challenges emerging in Boeing's production efforts could be impactful," he stated.
* Rising interest rates remain a headwind for margins, with management highlighting the importance of fixed-rate borrowings.
* Supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks were identified as ongoing challenges for the industry.

### Final Takeaway

Air Lease Corporation closed 2024 with record revenues and fleet value, supported by robust demand for both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Management's focus on lease rate growth, debt reduction, and strategic fleet placements positions the company well for 2025, despite potential headwinds from supply chain challenges and elevated interest rates. The company expects steady lease yield improvements over the next several years, underpinned by strong market dynamics and a well-placed order book.
