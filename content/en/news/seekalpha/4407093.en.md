Earnings Call Insights: Waters Corporation (NYSE:[WAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WAT "Waters Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Udit Batra, CEO, highlighted high single-digit constant currency revenue growth and low teens adjusted EPS growth for Q4 2024. Sales in the Pharma segment, the largest market, grew in the low double digits, supported by a recovery in customer CapEx spending and instrument replacement cycles.
* Instrument sales increased 8%, led by liquid chromatography ([LC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LC "LendingClub Corporation")), mass spectrometry (Mass Spec), and TA systems, which each grew high single digits or better. Alliance iS accounted for 20% of HPLC revenues, while Xevo TQ Absolute contributed 50% of tandem quad revenue.
* Recurring revenue grew 9%, driven by chemistry and service revenue increases. Chemistry consumables like Max Peak Premier Columns grew 30% in Q4 and over 40% for the year. Service plan attachment reached over 50% of the active installed base for the first time.
* CFO Amol Chaubal reported Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.10 and GAAP EPS of $3.88. Adjusted operating margin reached 35.5%, aided by pricing and cost management efforts despite FX headwinds.

### Outlook

* For 2025, Waters expects constant currency sales growth of 4.5%-7%, translating to total reported sales growth of approximately 2.5%-5% due to FX headwinds. Non-GAAP EPS guidance is projected at $12.70-$13.00, reflecting 7%-10% growth.
* Q1 2025 guidance estimates constant currency sales growth of 4%-7%, with total reported sales growth of 1%-4%. Non-GAAP EPS for Q1 is expected to range from $2.17-$2.25.
* Management anticipates 30 basis points annual growth contributions from GLP-1 and PFAS testing, while the growing generics market in India is projected to add 70-100 basis points annually.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 sales were reported at $873 million, an 8% increase in constant currency. Growth was attributed to a high-teens quarter-over-quarter revenue ramp and strong performance across all regions. Europe grew 11%, Asia 9%, and the Americas 6%. China returned to positive growth, increasing in the low single digits.
* Pharma sales grew 10%, led by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia. PFAS-related revenue increased by over 40% in Q4, while clinical revenue grew in the low teens.
* Full-year 2024 sales were flat in constant currency, with recurring revenue up 6%. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $11.86, a 1% growth, including a 5% FX-related decline.
* Free cash flow for Q4 was $188 million, with full-year free cash flow at $744 million, representing 25% of sales.

### Q&A

* Tycho Peterson, Jefferies, inquired about budget flush dynamics and the replacement cycle. CEO Batra noted a high-teens quarter-over-quarter sales ramp in Q4, indicating a typical budget flush. He also highlighted strong replacement activity in large pharma, supported by Alliance iS adoption (20% of HPLC revenue in Q4).
* Vijay Kumar, Evercore ISI, asked about risks tied to macroeconomic factors, including NIH spending cuts. Batra emphasized strong momentum in Pharma, GLP-1 testing, and PFAS testing, stating that recurring revenues have consistently grown 6%-7% through various cycles.
* Puneet Souda, Leerink, sought clarity on Q1 2025 guidance and NIH-related risks. CFO Chaubal explained that Q1 guidance prudently reflects uncertainties and includes a 7% FX headwind on earnings.
* Eve Burstein, Bernstein, asked about the replacement opportunity. Batra explained that 15% of the 2015-2019 replacement lag remains, while broader replacement cycles are gaining traction, particularly in large pharma.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on recovery in customer spending, instrument replacement cycles, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Questions centered on guidance assumptions and the sustainability of growth drivers.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing operational excellence and innovation. CEO Batra described the replacement cycle as "kicking into gear" and expressed confidence in achieving guidance targets.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management demonstrated increased optimism, particularly regarding instrument growth and recovery in China.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 2024 featured stronger instrument sales growth (8% vs. 1% in Q3) and broader regional acceleration. Europe, Asia, and the Americas all reported higher growth rates compared to Q3.
* Recurring revenue growth improved from 7% in Q3 to 9% in Q4, driven by chemistry consumables and service attachment rates.
* Management sentiment shifted positively, with greater confidence in replacement cycles and growth contributions from idiosyncratic drivers like GLP-1 and PFAS testing.
* Analysts maintained a focus on China and macroeconomic risks but acknowledged Waters' improved execution and recovery momentum.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted FX headwinds as a continued challenge for 2025, estimating a 4% EPS impact for the full year.
* Analysts raised concerns about NIH budget cuts and macroeconomic uncertainties. Management stated that less than 1% of Waters' revenue is directly tied to NIH funding.
* Biotech research and China remain areas of potential softness, though management noted improving conditions in both segments.

### Final Takeaway

Waters Corporation closed 2024 on a strong note, with high single-digit revenue growth and accelerating instrument sales driven by the replacement cycle and adoption of new products like Alliance iS and Xevo TQ Absolute. Recurring revenues remained resilient, and management provided confident guidance for 2025, projecting 4.5%-7% constant currency sales growth and 7%-10% non-GAAP EPS growth. Despite FX headwinds and macroeconomic uncertainties, Waters is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in GLP-1 and PFAS testing, as well as the generics market in India.
