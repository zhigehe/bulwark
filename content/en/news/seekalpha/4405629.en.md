Earnings Call Insights: DBS Group ([OTCPK:DBSDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBSDF "DBS Group Holdings Ltd")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Piyush Gupta highlighted that DBS achieved a strong total shareholder return growth of 14% over 15 years, emphasizing a dividend yield of 6%-7%. He expressed confidence in DBS's prospects, stating, "I'm very bullish on DBS' prospects."
* Guidance for net interest income (NII) was adjusted slightly upward compared to the previous quarter. Gupta noted that the impact of this change on pre-tax and net profit guidance is minimal, estimating a $50M-$100M upside due to recalibrated assumptions around Fed rate cuts.
* CFO Sok Hui Lim stated that despite higher special provisions in Q4 2024, these were offset by recoveries spilling into Q1 2025. She added, "We’re comfortable, we’re not complacent," referencing strengthened risk management processes.
* Wealth management saw net new money of $21B for the year, with $6B added in Q4, driven by disciplined client onboarding and product offerings. Gupta noted that the team has budgeted mid-teens growth in this segment for 2025.

### Outlook

* Management anticipates net interest margins ([NIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIM "Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund")) to decline through 2025, starting from 2.12% in January, driven by fixed rate portfolio roll-offs and CASA inflows. Lim added this sensitivity could increase to $6M-$7M by year-end, supported by CASA recovery.
* Wealth management remains a key focus, with mid-teens growth targeted, supported by expanded RM capacity and new client onboarding. Gupta acknowledged that market sentiment could influence performance, stating, "If the market sell-off, people stop putting money to work."
* The team expects additional upside in Hong Kong, pivoting from commercial real estate to wealth management, and sees growth potential in cross-border and outbound Greater China transactions.

### Financial Results

* Net interest income benefited from higher treasury portfolio contributions, with fixed-rate asset additions yielding a 170-180 basis point pickup.
* Non-performing loans in Hong Kong increased due to exchange rate effects and specific credit concerns in prior quarters. However, Gupta noted successful loan recoveries on distressed properties sold at market-adjusted prices.
* Wealth management revenue for the year grew 40%, excluding Citi Taiwan’s contribution, reflecting robust client activity despite a seasonal Q4 dip.
* Operating expenses included special staff bonuses and fixed asset impairments, resulting in a full-year cost-income ratio of 39.9%. Lim anticipates mid-single-digit expense growth for 2025.

### Q&A

* **Aakash Rawat, UBS:** Asked about NIM resilience and whether fixed-rate roll-offs were factored into guidance. Piyush Gupta clarified that sensitivity would rise marginally through 2025 as CASA inflows increase.
* **Nick Lord, Morgan Stanley:** Inquired about Hong Kong loan contraction and property sales. CFO Sok Hui Lim attributed the contraction to a strategic shift away from mortgages and commercial real estate, while property sales involved buyers ranging from funds to strategic developers.
* **Harsh Wardhan Modi, JPMorgan:** Questioned the sustainability of DBS's cost-income ratio. Gupta affirmed that it remains stable at 50% across all wealth management segments, bolstered by digital tools and operational efficiencies.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed optimism but raised concerns about NIM pressures, asset quality in Hong Kong, and the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties. Tone skewed slightly positive overall.
* Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic pivots and robust provisions. During Q&A, responses were factual but occasionally defensive, particularly around asset quality and NIM guidance.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone reflected cautious optimism, balancing growth targets with acknowledgment of macroeconomic risks.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for NII improved slightly this quarter, reflecting adjusted Fed rate cut assumptions. Pre-tax and net profit expectations remained stable.
* Wealth management continued to demonstrate strong growth, with $6B net new money in Q4, compared to $5B in Q3. Seasonal revenue softness was attributed to typical fourth-quarter trends.
* Hong Kong NPL concerns persisted, but proactive loan recovery efforts and reduced exposure to commercial real estate showed progress.
* Analysts' focus shifted toward asset quality and macroeconomic risks, while management's confidence in wealth and cross-border strategies remained steady.

### Risks and Concerns

* Rising interest rates in Hong Kong could create stress in the SME and consumer books, though management indicated these exposures are well-provisioned.
* Seasonal factors and market sentiment could impact wealth management inflows and transaction volumes.
* Continued monitoring of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical risks, particularly in core markets such as Hong Kong and Greater China.

### Final Takeaway

DBS Group delivered a strong Q4 2024 performance, bolstered by disciplined wealth management growth and proactive risk management. The company remains focused on mid-teens growth in wealth management for 2025, supported by new client inflows and expanded RM capacity. While asset quality concerns and NIM pressures persist, management's confidence in strategic pivots and robust provisions underpins a cautiously optimistic outlook.
