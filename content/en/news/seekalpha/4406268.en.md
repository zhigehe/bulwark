Oilfield services provider SLB (NYSE:[SLB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLB "Schlumberger Limited")) +2% in Tuesday's trading after Reuters reported the company is reorganizing certain functions and continuing to reduce its workforce.

As part of its reorganization, SLB (NYSE:[SLB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLB "Schlumberger Limited")) will create a new performance function, led by a new chief performance officer that will include a series of functions, ranging from security and operational integrity to global business services, according to an internal email sent to employees a day ago and seen by Reuters.

The changes come as the company has been working on a cost-savings initiative, according to the [report](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oilfield-services-company-slb-reorganizes-expects-more-job-cuts-source-says-2025-02-11/ "report"), and is preparing for tepid growth this year as its customers are more cautious about spending amid concerns of an oversupplied oil market.

The number of layoffs as part of the reorganization is not yet clear, but personnel updates reportedly would be released by the end of the quarter.

SLB ([SLB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLB "Schlumberger Limited")), which employed ~111K people as of February 2024, already has implemented some restructuring efforts in the past year and took $237M in severance charges in 2024.
