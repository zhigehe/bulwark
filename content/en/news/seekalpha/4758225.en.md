aluxum





In July, I wrote a bullish [article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703259-qqqi-or-jepq-which-income-fund-is-better) on the Neos Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:[QQQI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQI "NEOS NASDAQ-100(R) High Income ETF")), noting that QQQI's flexibility in writing call spreads is a valuable 'real option' that makes the QQQI more attractive than traditional covered call funds like the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF ([JEPQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JEPQ "JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF")) or the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF ([QYLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QYLD "Global X Funds - Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF")).

However, with the markets constantly evolving and new derivative income funds being seemingly launched on a weekly basis, I no longer believe the QQQI to be the 'best' option for investors seeking high distribution yields and total returns.

In my opinion, 0DTE covered call funds like the Innovation-100 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF ([QDTE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QDTE "Roundhill N-100 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF")) may be better than QQQI as QDTE exploits elevated investor enthusiasm for 0DTE call options to generate superior distribution yields. QDTE's 'long-only' characteristic in the overnight session also leads to higher total returns. I am downgrading QQQI to a hold recommendation.

Fund Overview
-------------

The Neos Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in the holdings of the Nasdaq-100 Index while using a 'data-driven' call option strategy to generate premium income.

The QQQI ETF was launched approximately 1 year ago in January 2024, but it has seen strong growth with over $900 million in assets under management ("AUM") (Figure 1). The QQQI ETF charges a 0.68% gross expense ratio.

[![QDTE overview](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739386620885184.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739386620885184_origin.png)

The QQQI ETF's current portfolio consists of large-cap technology stocks like Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) and NVIDIA ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) plus written call options with March 21, 2025 expiry at 22,025 and 22,350 strikes on the Nasdaq-100 Index (Figure 2).

With the Nasdaq-100 Index hovering just below 22,000 since late December, QQQI's call options are currently 1-2% out of the money ("OTM") (Figure 3).

[![QQQI's written call options are ~1-2% OTM](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393915136548154.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393915136548154_origin.png)

Flexible Strategy Is A Selling Point
------------------------------------

As I have written in my prior articles, QQQI's main selling point is its flexible call option writing strategy. Instead of writing only call options, QQQI's mandate allows Neos, the fund manager, to write a mixture of call options and call spreads (short a call option while owning a call option with a higher strike) (Figure 4).

[![Illustrative bear call spread](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393891632754169.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393891632754169_origin.png)



Figure 4 - Illustrative bear call spread (Investopedia)





Writing call spreads gives the manager the ability to earn premium income while participating in the underlying stock's rally beyond the upper strike price, should there be a large rally. This is an important 'real option', especially after large declines in the markets, as blindly writing calls can truncate upside capture and lead to low total returns.

But Still Hampered By Covered Call Weakness
-------------------------------------------

However, over the long run, the QQQI ETF is still expected to significantly underperform the Nasdaq-100 Index, as its covered call strategy trades away most of its market returns upside in exchange for an up-front premium.

Since its inception in January 2024, the QQQI has underperformed the Invesco QQQ ETF ([QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ "Invesco QQQ ETF")), which also tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, by over 100 bps (Figure 5).

[![QQQI has lagged QQQ](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739390161942374.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739390161942374_origin.png)

Furthermore, while QQQI does not have a long operating history, we may be able to infer its longer-term performance by observing the performance of the Neos S&P 500 High Income ETF ([SPYI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYI "NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF")) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ([SPY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY "SPDRÂ® S&P 500 ETF Trust")), as QQQI and SPYI have very similar strategies. Since August 2022, SPYI has only delivered 41.4% in total returns compared to SPY with 57.7% (Figure 6).

[![SPYI has significantly lagged SPY](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739390316186592.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739390316186592_origin.png)

Enter The New Contender - QDTE
------------------------------

To address the shortcomings of the covered call strategy, innovative fund managers like Roundhill Investments have recently introduced covered call funds like the Roundhill Innovation-100 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF ("QDTE") that uses 0DTE ("zero days to expiry") call options instead of monthly options currently employed by QQQI and other vanilla covered call funds.

The QDTE ETF was launched in March 2024, but has quickly gained a cult following and almost $800 million in AUM (Figure 7). The QDTE ETF charges a 0.95% expense ratio.

[![QDTE overview](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739397179925276.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739397179925276_origin.png)

0DTE Options - Risky Bet Or Attractive Opportunity?
---------------------------------------------------

Most investors [view](https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/zero-days-0dte-options-explained) 0DTE options as a cheap way to gain directional exposure on the underlying stocks or indices. For example, on February 12th, 2025, the QQQ ETF opened at 522.3 after a hotter-than-expected [CPI report](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi) caused stocks to tumble pre-market. Investors who remained bullish could have bought the 525-strike 0DTE calls on the QQQ ETF for ~$1 / option at the open (less than 0.2% of the notional). As stocks regained their losses throughout the day, the 525-strike 0DTE calls traded as high as $4 / share (300% returns on the initial investment~), as QQQ recovered to $528 (Figure 8).

[![0DTE options can offer tremendous returns](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393953290667255.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393953290667255_origin.png)



Figure 8 - 0DTE options can offer tremendous returns (Author created using Interactive Brokers)





Lured by these 300% potential returns, investors have been flocking to this 'daily casino' in hopes of cashing in on these low-probability, high-payout bets. According to data from the CBOE, 0DTE options now account for roughly 40-50% of the total volume of options traded (Figure 9).

[![0DTE options now account for roughly 50% of option volume](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_0DTEBLOG_20Social_20Image_thumb1.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_0DTEBLOG_20Social_20Image.png)



Figure 9 - 0DTE options now account for roughly 50% of option volume (roundhillinvestments.com)





Unfortunately, for many investors, 0DTE options are also a quick path to financial ruin, as losses from these low-probability bets can pile up quickly.

However, if we flip the idea around, [0DTE options](https://blog.roundhillinvestments.com/what-are-0dte-options), if used systematically, can be a great tool for investors looking to generate high income precisely because of their popularity with short-term speculators.

For example, if we look at implied volatilities (IV is the 'price' of an option), we often see the implied volatility of 0DTE options trade much higher than longer maturity options (Figure 10).

[![0DTE IV are usually much higher](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393961868062773.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393961868062773_origin.png)



Figure 10 - 0DTE IV are usually much higher (Author created using Interactive Brokers)





This is partly because of the elevated investor demand for these speculative bets mentioned above, and also because dealers must raise the option prices (i.e. IV) in order to cover their risks from significant rallies or declines intraday.

For covered call funds, selling daily 0DTE covered calls can therefore lead to significantly higher premium income over time compared to selling monthly options. This unique feature of option markets has allowed the QDTE ETF to pay investors nearly 3 times the distributions compared to QQQI and other vanilla covered call funds.

On a trailing 12-month basis, QDTE has paid investors a 35.7% distribution yield compared to 13.8% for QQQI, 9.6% for JEPQ, and 12.2% for the QYLD (Investors should note that QDTE's annualized trailing yield should be even higher, as the fund only began operations in March 2024) (Figure 11).

[![QDTE pays a significantly higher distribution yield](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393964958207552.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393964958207552_origin.png)

Long-Only In Overnight Session Is Another Benefit
-------------------------------------------------

Another benefit of the QDTE ETF compared to vanilla covered call funds is that once its 0DTE options expire, the QDTE behaves like a 'long-only' fund (Figure 12).

![QDTE is a long-only fund for overnight session](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/8/54854261-17363885344301457.png)



Figure 12 - QDTE behaves like a 'long-only' fund in the overnight session (roundhillinvestments.com)





Historically, most of the stock markets' gains actually occur in the overnight session in an effect called the ["Night Effect".](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trading-night-effect-moritz-seibert#:~:text=The%20Night%20Effect%2C%20also%20known,compared%20to%20intraday%20trading%20sessions.) From 1993 to 2022, almost all the S&P 500's gains occurred overnight (Figure 13)

![Illustrative 'Night Effect'](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/8/54854261-17363897174163895.png)



Figure 13 - Illustrative 'Night Effect' (Bespoke Investment Group)





So the QDTE ETF can be thought of as capturing the "night effect" of Nasdaq stocks while earning covered call premium income during the regular trading session.

The result is that since QDTE's inception, it has delivered superior total returns compared to QQQI and JEPQ, returning 20.9% compared to QQQI at 18.8% and JEPQ at 18.4%. In fact, QDTE has even outperformed the QQQ ETF which returned 19.2% since March 7, 2024 (Figure 14).

[![QDTE has outperformed other covered call funds](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739397848659027.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-1739397848659027_origin.png)

Risks To QDTE
-------------

However, the downside risk of the QDTE ETF is that relative to QQQI, the QDTE receives smaller option premiums (as the premium income is typically far less for daily options), but at a higher frequency. This may result in the QDTE ETF having less 'downside cushion' during market drawdowns compared to QQQI.

Furthermore, with equity markets trading at some of the highest valuation multiples in history, the S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 21.8 while the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap stocks are trading at a forward P/E of 28.7, equities may be prone to sharp drawdowns (Figure 15).

[![Equities are trading at some of the highest valuation levels ever](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393983150400722.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/54854261-17393983150400722_origin.png)

Conclusion
----------

In my prior article, I recommended the QQQI ETF as a relative buy compared to other covered call funds as its flexible mandate allows the QQQI to selectively write call options or call spreads.

However, with the introduction of 0DTE covered call funds like the QDTE ETF, I no longer believe the QQQI ETF is the best option for income investors seeking technology exposure.

The QDTE exploits speculators' enthusiasm for low-probability 0DTE call options by writing high IV 0DTE covered calls, earning elevated premium income. Furthermore, the QDTE ETF acts like a 'long-only' fund during the important overnight session when most of the market's historical returns are generated.

Overall, I believe the QDTE has displaced QQQI as the 'King of the Hill' with superior total returns and income potential compared to the QQQI. I am downgrading QQQI to a **hold** recommendation.
