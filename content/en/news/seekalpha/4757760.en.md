Investment Overview
-------------------

In my [last note](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4677687-acadia-stock-post-pimavanserin-study-setback-selloff-may-continue) on Acadia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[ACAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACAD "ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.")) for Seeking Alpha back in March 2024, I gave the company's stock a "Sell" rating. Shares were priced at $20 at the time, and after some volatility, had fallen to a value of <$1.5 by October, before mounting a sustained recovery, almost reaching $20 again earlier this month. Current traded price is $18.4, and market cap valuation $3.05bn. One year on from my "sell" call, in light of recent developments, is there any change to my thesis?

First of all, let's remind ourselves of Acadia's core business - as per the company's Q3 2024 quarterly report/[10Q submission](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9218868#ACAD-20240930_HTM_item_2_managements_discussion_analysis_f):

> Our commercial portfolio includes two products. In April 2016, the FDA approved NUPLAZID for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP (Parkinson's Diseases Psychosis), which is the first and only drug approved in the United States for this condition.
> 
> In September 2023, we announced that the FDA made two changes to the NUPLAZID label clarifying its use in patients with Parkinson’s disease-related hallucinations and delusions, with or without dementia, which is consistent with the current indication.
> 
> In March 2023, the FDA approved DAYBUE for the treatment of Rett syndrome, which is the first and only drug approved for this condition. DAYBUE became available by prescription in the United States in April 2023.

Between 2016 and 2023, Acadia grew revenues from $17.3m, to $726.4m, an impressive growth rate, although top-line growth did not result in bottom-line profits. In those ten years, Acadia has made a net loss of >$(250m) in three of those years, >$(200m) in six, and between 2020 and 2022 the figures were $(282m), $(168m), and $(216m). The accumulated deficit reported as of the end of Q3 was $(2.35bn).

In 2023, net loss narrowed to $(61.3m), a significant improvement, and across the first nine months of 2024 Acadia has reported a profit of $82.7m, or $0.5 per share, versus a loss of $(107m), or $(0.65) per share, in the prior year period.

In Q3, revenues were [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19906062-acadia-pharmaceuticals-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-operating-overview#hasComeFromMpArticle=false) as $250.4m, up 18% year-on-year, with NUPLAZID revenues of $159.2m, up 10% year-on-year, and DAYBUE revenues of $91.2m, up 36% year-on-year. DAYBUE is forecast by management to earn 2024 revenues of $340m - $350m, while NUPLAZID revenues are expected to be $600 - $610m

In a [presentation](https://ir.acadia.com/static-files/88699f18-830b-4661-8c04-c148ffc2d2f2) given at this year's JPMorgan Healthcare conference in January, Acadia stated it expected to drive >$1bn revenues in 2025, and shared its anticipated milestones for the year as follows:

As of Q3, Acadia reported a cash position of $155m, and near term investments of $410m. Finally, the company has a new CEO in Catherine Owen Adams, who [replaced](https://acadia.com/en-us/media/news-releases/catherine-owen-adams-succeeds-steve-davis-ceo-acadia) Steve Davis in September last year, also joining the Board of Directors. Adams was formerly Senior Vice President and General Manager, U.S., at Pharma giant Bristol-Myers Squibb ([BMY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company")).

NUPLAZID's Prospects For Long-Term Growth?
------------------------------------------

At the time of my last note, Acadia's pimavanserin, the underlying ingredient in NUPLAZID, had just flunked a Phase 3 clinical study in patients with schizophrenia. According to Acadia's [press release](https://acadia.com/media/news-releases/acadia-pharmaceuticals-announces-top-line-results-from-phase-3-advance-2-trial-of-pimavanserin-in-negative-symptoms-of-schizophrenia/) announcing the study failure:

> Pimavanserin did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the study’s primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score (-11.8 vs. -11.1; p=0.4825; effect size=0.07).

Acadia has struggled to secure label expansions for pimavanserin, failing with approval shots in hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis ("DRP") in 2021 (which saw the share price fall from ~$50, to ~$20, almost overnight), and in Alzheimer's Disease related psychosis in 2022 - both applications were rejected by the FDA.

I noted in my last post that NUPLAZID may lose patent protection from 2030, however Acadia has fought - and won (so far as I understand information provided in its latest 10Q) all challenges to its patent and attempts to bring generic versions of NUPLAZID to market, with the earliest permitted entry date for generics apparently 2038. As such, there are no real concerns on that front.

Acadia seems to be focusing attention on driving growth within NUPLAZID's current market of PDP, with management discussing advertising campaigns designed to raise awareness of the condition, both in the insured and direct to consumer ("DTC") markets, the latter featuring Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds. Acadia's head of commercial Brendan Teehan told analysts on the [Q3 earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733999-acadia-pharmaceuticals-inc-acad-q3-2024-earnings-conference-call-transcript):

> In just the first two weeks post campaign, we saw a nearly threefold increase in Parkinson's disease patients who visited NUPLAZID.com and subsequently visited a PD specialist. As a reminder, we expect the vast majority of the benefit of these campaigns to be seen in 2025 as new patient schedule appointments with their specialists and seek treatment for hallucinations and delusions with NUPLAZID in the months ahead.

Coupled with real-world evidence demonstrating a "lower overall risk of all-cause mortality versus all other off-label antipsychotics, most notably low-dose quetiapine", Acadia is still driving double-digit revenue growth for NUPLAZID, and it's conceivable that its lead drug still has "blockbuster" (>$1bn per annum) revenue potential. Apparently, the drug only has a 20% current share of the market.

Meanwhile, Acadia has secured approval for DAYBUE in Canada, and hopes to add a European approval in 2026, and potentially in Japan also.

Acadia's Pipeline Promise
-------------------------

Acadia has a relatively rich pipeline of assets progressing through clinical studies, also, as shown in a presentation slide below:

 [![chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/49171940-17393916114556324.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/49171940-17393916114556324_origin.png) 



Acadia pipeline (presentation)





Acadia hopes that its next-generation version of NUPLAZID, candidate ACP-204, can gain an approval in Alzheimer's Disease Psychosis. On the Q3 earnings call, Head of R&D Liz Thompson told analysts:

> In particular, to date, we've seen no sign of QT prolongation at the dose of year study, a wide dose range, supporting the potential for a dose equivalent to approximately twice the approved NUPLAZID 34-milligram dose and steady PK achieved in less than half the time of NUPLAZID, projecting the potential for an earlier onset of activity.

With Phase 2 results yet to be shared, and Phase 3 studies yet to initiate, we may not see much data in 2025, but this represents a potentially important opportunity for the company to succeed in an indication where NUPLAZID was unsuccessful.

Candidate ACP-101 introduces a new potential market for the company in Prader-Willi Syndrome, a genetic condition characterised by unrelenting hunger, leaving patients with a life expectancy of ~30 years. The disease affects 8-10k patients in the US, Acadia says.

ACP-101 is an intranasal formulation of carbetocin, a long-acting analogue of human oxytocin, acquired via Acadia's acquisition of Levo Therapeutics in 2022. Levo's Phase 2 study was successful, with the foundation for Prader-Willi research [reporting](https://www.fpwr.org/blog/results-of-phase-2-study-evaluating-carbetocin-for-pws-published) in 2018 that:

> Compared to placebo, the 14-day regimen of i.n. carbetocin significantly reduced hyperphagia and food-related behaviors (hyperphagia is the relentless hunger that is characteristic of PWS)

The trial was short, but Acadia's Phase 3 will last 12 weeks, and top-line results are expected in Q1 2026.

Analysis - Is Acadia Stock Set For Growth In 2025?
--------------------------------------------------

Acadia stock is down nearly 60% on a five-year basis - as I discussed in my last note, it has never properly recovered from the failed DRP approval shot in 2021. Since then, it has spiked >30 per share only twice, in July 2023, when Acadia disclosed it had acquired expanded commercial rights to trofinetide, now approved as DAYBUE, and in December 2023, when it [won a court case](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4045975-acadia-pharmaceuticals-surges-after-win-in-patent-suit-over-nuplazid) against generic drug manufacturer MSN Laboratories.

Still, when we consider the guidance for >$1bn revenues in 2025, the company's profitability, and the promising pipeline, a market cap valuation of $3.2bn arguably undervalues the company, representing a price to sales ("P/S") ratio of just over 3x, and, if we "guesstimate" EPS in 2025 could reach $1 per share, a price to earnings ratio of 19x.

Acadia stock has built some solid momentum on a 6-month basis, being up nearly 25%, although a concern would be the lack of major catalysts arriving this year - most of the key data catalysts look set to arrive early in 2026.

With plenty of funding available, if its clinical studies are successful, the company ought to be able to afford wide-scale commercial launches, and we can already point to its marketing campaigns being successful, increasing awareness of niche conditions that patients may not have been aware are treatable with Acadia's products.

Although it is an imperfect science, I like to look at other commercial Pharmas generating a similar amount of revenues and compare market cap valuations. In Acadia's case, PTC Therapeutics ([PTCT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTCT "PTC Therapeutics, Inc.")) earned $938m of revenues in 2023, and is valued at $3.8bn, despite making heavy losses in that year.

Sarepta Therapeutics ([SRPT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRPT "Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.")) earned $1.2bn of revenues, made an operating profit, and is valued at $10.5bn, although the company is now targeting $3bn revenues in 2025. Alkermes ([ALKS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALKS "Alkermes plc")), earned $1.6bn revenues in 2023, earned net income of $356m, and is valued at $5.4bn.

This, coupled with the rest of my analysis shared above, suggests to me that it is time to take Acadia off the "sell" list, but is there enough evidence to make a compelling "Bull" case?

Acadia's struggles with NUPLAZID are no longer the only barometer of the company's progress, or lack of it, now that there is a second commercial product on the market showing good revenue growth, and now that the company is no longer loss-making, has multiple new approval shots in play, and is financially healthy, I think we can skip the "Hold" recommendation and move straight to a "Buy" rating.
