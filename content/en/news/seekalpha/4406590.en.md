Earnings Call Insights: Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:[EW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EW "Edwards Lifesciences Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Bernard Zovighian highlighted a strong Q4 2024 performance with total company sales growing 9% year-over-year to $1.39 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. He emphasized the success of strategic decisions in 2024, including the sale of the Critical Care business, a focus on structural heart technologies, and significant investments in internal R&D and acquisitions like JC Medical, JenaValve, and Endotronix.
* Zovighian announced that the company expects TMTT to deliver more than $500 million in sales in 2025, driven by the PASCAL repair system and EVOQUE replacement system. He also noted progress with the SAPIEN M3 mitral replacement system, expected to gain European approval by mid-2025.
* CFO Scott Ullem stated, "We were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups." He provided further details on the company’s financials, including adjusted gross profit margin of 79% and plans to maintain R&D and SG&A spending at Q4 levels throughout 2025.

### Outlook

* Edwards maintained its 2025 financial guidance, targeting total company sales of $5.6 billion to $6 billion, with TAVR sales of $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, TMTT sales of $500 million to $530 million, and Surgical sales of $970 million to $1.05 billion.
* The company anticipates adjusted gross profit margins for 2025 to remain between 78% and 79%, with operating profit margins of 27% to 28%.
* Early TAVR trial results are expected to drive guideline and policy changes globally after FDA approval in mid-2025, presenting a multi-year growth opportunity.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 sales reached $1.39 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth, supported by gains in all product groups. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.59, compared to analysts' estimate of $0.55.
* TAVR global sales grew 5.3% year-over-year to $1.04 billion in Q4. Growth in the U.S. and Europe was attributed to the continued adoption of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform.
* TMTT sales reached $105 million for the quarter, supported by the strong adoption of the PASCAL repair system and EVOQUE replacement system. Full-year TMTT sales of $352 million marked a 77% year-over-year increase.
* The Surgical segment reported Q4 sales of $244 million, a 5% increase year-over-year, driven by robust adoption of RESILIA-based products.

### Q&A
