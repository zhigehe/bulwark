Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:[FOX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOX "Fox Corporation")) has [acquired Red Seat Ventures](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996828-fox-corporation-acquires-red-seat-ventures "acquired Red Seat Ventures"), a media company that supports podcasts and other digital services for creators including former Fox News stars Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly.

Red Seat Ventures will operate as a standalone entity within Fox's Tubi Media, whose CEO Paul Cheesbrough will serve as chairman of the podcast producer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal represents an investment in the so-called creator economy, which Cheesbrough said "is one of the fastest growing media categories worldwide by measure of reach and influence, and consumers are increasingly looking to get insights and entertainment directly from the voices and brands they trust."

Red Seat Ventures's 17 creator-led shows in total drove over 200M monthly active views last November. Some of its clients include Chris Hansen, former Dateline host and current true-crime YouTuber, as well as TV personalities Dr. Phil and Piers Morgan.

Podcasts have grown to become an important source of information, even in the 2024 election cycle - with Donald Trump acknowledging podcast hosts like Joe Rogan and Theo Von in his election victory speech. According to a [report](https://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Infinite-Dial-2024-Presentation.pdf "report") by Edison Research last year, nearly 100M Americans aged 12 and older listened to podcasts every week.
