Summary
-------

I gave a [buy rating](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4729578-sp-global-spgi-reiterate-buy-rating-fundamentals-sound) to S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:[SPGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPGI "S&P Global Inc.")) in October, with my key thesis being that the business fundamentals were strong, and the growth outlook was robust. I reiterate my buy rating for SPGI. Despite the guided slow growth for FY25, I see a catalyst for upside surprise, and if true, I expect SPGI to grow adj EPS by low-teens for the foreseeable future.

Earnings results update: A strong end to the year
-------------------------------------------------

In the [latest quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997828-s-and-p-global-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A4) (4Q24), reported two days ago, SPGI grew revenue by 14% y/y to $3.592 billion, beating consensus estimates of 11% growth. The Ratings segment grew 26.7% y/y, heavily supported by a 54.1% y/y growth in transaction revenue; Market Intelligence [MI] saw 5.2% y/y growth; the Commodity Insights [CI] segment grew 9.7% y/y; Indices grew 21.1% y/y; and mobility grew 9% y/y. Even more remarkable was adj EBIT margin, which expanded 260 bps y/y to 46.7%, reflecting the potential for margins to go even higher as SPGI scales. Finally, adj EPS saw $3.77, beating estimates by 8.7%, and represented a ~21% y/y growth.

Solid growth outlook ahead
--------------------------

There wasn’t really much to complain about SPGI 4Q24 earnings. The key takeaway for me was that the growth outlook remains solid, and SPGI continues to deserve a buy rating.

Firstly, while ratings segment revenue growth is guided to decelerate to 3-5% in 2025 (as many companies pull forward debt issuance in 2024; for reference, billed issuance grew 54% in 2024), I don’t think this is alarming considering that it grew 31% in FY24. On a two-year stack basis, FY25 ratings growth is still in the mid-30%. I also think that there is potential for SPGI to beat this guide. One, management noted that the mix of issuance could shift slightly more toward investment-grade debt in 2025 compared to 2024, and depending on how strong the demand is (reliant on Fed rates and the US long-term treasury yield), this could drive upside. I also highlight that [Breckinridge Capital Advisors](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/details/q1-2025-corporate-bond-market-outlook/) and [AllianceBernstein](https://www.alliancebernstein.com/us/en-us/investments/insights/investment-insights/2025-credit-outlook-on-firm-ground-despite-shifting-political-sands.html) sounded bullish on investment-grade credit for 2025. Two, the potential [recovery in M&A activities](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/m-and-a-outlook-2025-expectations-high) could [drive](https://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-banking/insights/articles/2025-ma-outlook/report.pdf) a huge upside surprise if [deal volume picks up](https://www.jpmorgan.com/investment-banking/mergers-and-acquisitions-market-outlook) faster than expected.

Secondly, the indices segment should continue to print robust growth because of a strong stock market environment. A bullish market drives ETF inflows and rising market valuations, which leads to more ETF inflows (a virtuous cycle). For reference, SPGI now has $4.4 trillion in ETF AUM benchmarked to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is a significant jump from $3.9 trillion in 4Q23. While the entire segment grew ~21% y/y, asset-linked fees grew 31% y/y, benefiting from strong demand for index products. As such, even though management guidance only calls for 8-10% revenue growth in FY25 for this segment. I see potential for upside if the market enters a strong bull market (fuelled by potentially [lower rates](https://fortune.com/2025/02/12/trump-wants-lower-interest-rates-tariffs-yields-soaring-inflation-data-hot/), the end of Ukraine[/Russia conflict](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/), and no major trade wars).

Lastly, SPGI AI-initiatives investments are translating into revenue growth, particularly in MI and CI. In the MI segment, SPGI’s AI initiatives, including Kensho LLM-Ready API, Chat AI, and Document Intelligence, have driven deeper customer engagement, and this has helped to drive growth. As for the CI segment, SPGI has embedded gen-AI into core workflows. Although not many quantitative details have been shared in this aspect, I believe the improved efficiency achieved from the gen-AI solutions should enable SPGI to sustain pricing power. For instance:

1. Platts AI-driven pricing assessments provide more accurate and real-time commodity pricing data, improving market transparency.
2. AI-enhanced supply chain and emissions tracking helps corporates and regulators better navigate global carbon markets.

> Mentioned in the [4Q24 earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757092-s-and-p-global-inc-spgi-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript): We are gaining momentum in our product innovation and AI initiatives across the organization as well…You'll notice that across these examples of innovation runs a common thread of generative AI. When we look at the potential for generative AI across the business over the next several years, there are seemingly endless opportunities to innovate and add value for our customers

Shareholder Returns and Financial Strength
------------------------------------------

SPGI's capital return policy remains an attractive spot within its equity story. Management noted their commitment to return capital to shareholders, with a new $4.3 billion share buyback authorization and dividend increase (for the 52nd consecutive year). The good thing is this does not impair SPGI’s ability to reinvest in the company, as its guided FCF for 2025 can easily cover these expenses.

Valuation
---------

SPGI currently trades at 31.4x forward PE, which, in my view, remains reasonable given its high-margin business and double-digit EPS growth potential. Although management FY25 adj EPS guidance only calls for $17 to $17.25, implying 9% y/y growth, I see room for upside potential (as I noted above), potentially driving adj EPS growth to low teens. Suppose SPGI grows as I think it can, at low teens for the next few years, adj EPS could grow to ~$22 by FY27. Multiplying that by 30x implies a price target of ~$662, or ~24% upside.

Investment Risk
---------------

The worry is that the ratings segment revenue growth slows by much more than expected, as a substantial amount of issuance has been pulled forward. Some market participants may be spooked by this deceleration (even though it has been guided). Growth could decelerate by much more if the Fed ends up not cutting rates (note that the [recent core CPI reading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-02-12/us-economy-core-cpi-rises-0-4-in-january-video) rose above estimates), which drives increased market volatility that could impact debt issuance and ETF inflows.

Conclusion
----------

My positive view on SPGI is because I believe low-teens adjusted EPS growth is achievable. While ratings growth is expected to slow, potential upside from investment-grade issuance and M&A recovery could drive an upside surprise. The Indices segment remains strong, benefiting from ETF inflows and equity market gains. With $6 billion in FCF guided for FY25, the SPGI capital returns program also provides downside protection.
