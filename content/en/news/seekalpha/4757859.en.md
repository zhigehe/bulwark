Anyone who plays Monopoly can experience how quickly real estate holdings drag once cash in hand proves insufficient.

Bubbles may seem fun on the way up, but they’re universally brutal in the inevitable deflation stage. China’s stimulus boom helped inflate global demand and real estate prices after the 2008 recession, but mean reversion has been in motion since 2020 and counting.
