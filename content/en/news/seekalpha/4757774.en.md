Investment action
-----------------

I recommended a [sell rating](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4729287-robert-half-inc-still-negative-on-the-near-term-performance "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4729287-robert-half-inc-still-negative-on-the-near-term-performance") for Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:[RHI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHI "Robert Half Inc.")) when I wrote about it in October last year, as I continued to be bearish about RHI's near-term outlook. Based on my current outlook and analysis, I reiterate my sell rating. RHI's 4Q24 results reinforced my view that this is a struggling business. Given the uncertainty in the timing of recovery and the potential for more earnings decline, I don't think this should trade at a premium multiple of 22x forward earnings.

Review
------

[RHI's 4Q24 results](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19985347-robert-half-reports-fourth-quarter-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3 "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19985347-robert-half-reports-fourth-quarter-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3") were not great, as I expected. Total revenue came in at $1.38 billion, down 7% y/y on a constant currency same-day basis, marking the 8th quarter of consecutive decline. In terms of segmental breakdown:

1. Contract staffing revenue fell 11.5% y/y, with finance & accounting down 9.5%, administrative & customer support down 8.8%, and technology staffing down 3.5%;
2. Permanent placement revenue declined 11.1% y/y; and
3. Protiviti revenue grew 5.3% y/y. While this was a bright spot, it was not enough to offset the underperformance in RHI's core staffing business.

Margins were another weak point. EBIT margin fell to 5.1%, down 260 bps y/y, highlighting that RHI continues to suffer from negative operating leverage due to its strategy to maintain recruiter headcount despite lower hiring activity.

Looking ahead, RHI's guidance for 1Q25 effectively tells us that near-term performance will remain weak. Management expects revenue between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion, down about 3% y/y at the midpoint. The bigger "red flag" is that EPS is guided for $0.31-$0.41, which implies another significant y/y decline (~40% decline) and also means margins will face huge decremental margin again.

My view for the business is that it continues to struggle in this macro environment, and what makes it particularly concerning is that RHI's staffing business has now posted multiple consecutive quarters of revenue declines, with no clear sign of stabilization. As a recap:

1. Contract staffing revenue, on a constant currency same day basis, has declined for 9 consecutive quarters (all of them in double digits)
2. Permanent placement revenue has been in double-digit decline for 8 consecutive quarters.

This performance is extremely puzzling because the US labor market has been [fairly healthy](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-kugler-says-labor-market-healthy-inflation-elevated-2025-02-07/ "https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-kugler-says-labor-market-healthy-inflation-elevated-2025-02-07/"). While labor hoarding could be an issue-companies choose to retain existing employees rather than increase contract staffing-thereby limiting near-term demand, I wonder if there is a structural headwind that is impacting RHI (or its industry) specifically. One particular headwind that I am thinking about recently is the growing shift toward internalizing hiring teams with the adoption of AI, which is [cheaper](https://trainingmag.com/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-recruitment-for-candidates-and-employers/ "https://trainingmag.com/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-recruitment-for-candidates-and-employers/") and [better](https://www.theguardian.com/work-redefined/2024/dec/19/less-bias-better-hires-why-ai-could-transform-recruitment-for-smes "https://www.theguardian.com/work-redefined/2024/dec/19/less-bias-better-hires-why-ai-could-transform-recruitment-for-smes"). While these trends may take time to materialize fully, it is something that will continue to weigh on sentiment if RHI does not show any improvements. As such, even though the exact impact is hard to quantify today, if this shift is structural, it could permanently impair the need for traditional staffing firms like RHI.

Hence, I am of the view that RHI's strategy to maintain recruiter headcount is a mistake, and it is evident from the numbers:

1. 4Q24 operating margin fell to 5.1%, down 260 bps y/y;
2. Management's 1Q25 margin guidance of 2%-5% suggests further downside;
3. In 4Q24, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 34.1%, indicating that management is not focused on cost discipline.

My view is that demand will likely stay poor as businesses continue to be cautious on how the macroeconomy will develop, especially with the multiple policies that Trump plans to implement. As long as revenue does not pick up and RHI does not change its strategy, earnings *will very likely* continue to see substantial decline due to negative operating leverage.

Valuation
---------

I am unsure why the market is valuing RHI at 22x forward earnings when the outlook is unclear (visibility is weak in my view) and there is a potential structural impairment to its long-term growth outlook. I believe the market may be too optimistic in expecting a recovery over the near term. While this may come true, given that the 22x is 5x above RHI's historical average of 17x and also much higher than peers' (PageGroup, Randstad, Adecco, ManpowerGroup, and Hays PLC) average of 17x, the lack of a margin of safety makes it even harder to invest at this level. If RHI continues to print substantial earnings declines, it shouldn't take long for the market to re-rate RHI's multiple downwards.

Risk
----

If hiring demand recovers faster than expected, RHI could see a turnaround in demand, and potentially a substantial one considering that revenue has declined for eight quarters. The topline recovery will drive an even more substantial recovery in earnings due to the high operating leverage. This very likely leads to management revising estimates upwards, and this will be a big boost to the stock's sentiment.

Final thoughts
--------------

My recommendation remains a sell rating for RHI. I believe RHI remains in a tough spot. Its staffing segment continues to decline, margin continues to worsen, and valuation is not cheap relative to the near-term outlook. Until there are clear signs of revenue stabilization and margin recovery, I believe RHI's stock remains unattractive.
