### Management View

* CEO Jeremy Stoppelman highlighted that Yelp achieved record revenue of $1.41 billion in 2024, representing a 6% year-over-year increase. Services contributed strongly with 11% growth, while restaurant, retail, and other (RR&O) revenue declined by 3%. Net income grew by 34% year-over-year to $133 million, supported by disciplined expense management.
* Stoppelman emphasized the launch of 80 new features during the year, including the AI-powered Yelp Assistant, which drove a 50% sequential increase in project submissions from Q3 to Q4. The home services category led growth with 15% year-over-year revenue growth.
* CFO David Schwarzbach reported Q4 revenue of $362 million, driven by 11% growth in services advertising revenue, while RR&O revenue decreased 3%. Adjusted EBITDA reached $101 million, reflecting a 28% margin. He also noted a 40% year-over-year increase in diluted EPS to $1.88 due to share repurchases and reduced stock-based compensation.

### Outlook

* Yelp expects 2025 full-year revenue to range between $1.47 billion and $1.485 billion, reflecting continued strength in services but ongoing pressure in RR&O. Q1 2025 revenue is projected between $350 million and $355 million, aligned with seasonal trends.
* Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 ranges between $345 million and $360 million, with increased costs anticipated from the RepairPal acquisition and higher cost of revenue.

* Services advertising revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $225 million, supported by strong growth in consumer project submissions and improved ad formats. RR&O revenue declined to $121 million.
