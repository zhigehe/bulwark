Exploring A Dividend-Income Residential REIT
--------------------------------------------

Today in my new and ongoing set of articles for this platform in 2025, called *Financial Markets: Growing A Dividend Income Portfolio*, I'll be covering a real estate investment trust /REIT which specializes in residential properties, a change from some of my recent REITs who invest in healthcare or resort properties.

**BRT Apartments Corp. (NYSE:[BRT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT "BRT Apartments Corp."))**, according to its SA profile, "owns or has interests in 28 multifamily properties with 7,707 units in 11 states."

With a [dividend yield](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/scorecard "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/scorecard") topping +5%, and its [next earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/earnings "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/earnings") results due in about a month on March 13th, this is a great opportunity to explore this REIT further and approach it from multiple angles.

Financial Markets: Growing A Dividend Income Portfolio





Thesis Agrees With Quant System Rating: Hold
--------------------------------------------

My thesis today, using multiple research points, argues that this stock is a hold.

Although it could see future upside from continued population growth in the Sunbelt US region, and its +5% dividend yield may be attractive to dividend investors, some downside factors I considered were this firm's continued inability to turn a profit, its low interest coverage ratio, high debt, and the current elevated interest rate environment, as well as competition from other apartments in the same markets.

The following sections will go into those topics in more detail.

Dividend Yield Beats Sector But Investors Await Dividend Growth
---------------------------------------------------------------

Because I consider the +5% [dividend yield](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/scorecard "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/scorecard") a notable item, let's talk about that first.

From [SA data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/yield "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/yield"), relevant is that this yield beats the sector average by about 20 to 25%, which should be interesting to high-yield dividend investors looking to add a REIT to an existing dividend portfolio.

On the dividend growth side, however, this stock has not made a strong case as it lacks proven [dividend growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/dividend-growth "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/dividend-growth") in the last few years, and hasn't hiked its $0.25/share quarterly dividend since summer 2022, according to [history.](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/history "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/dividends/history")

[![BRT - div growth](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393768269935946.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393768269935946_origin.jpg)



BRT - div growth (Seeking Alpha)





As far as sustainability, I think it will depend on continued improvements to cashflow and earnings, which I will discuss next, and indicators point to strong likelihood of continued dividend stability at least.

Despite Net Losses, Cashflow Remains Positive
---------------------------------------------

When it comes to cashflow, it is an important fundamental I consider when looking at a REIT. In particular, I consider the operating cashflow since it relates to the core business operation, as well as the free cashflow/share.

In the case of BRT, even though it has posted net losses for several quarters on its [income statement](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/income-statement "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/income-statement"), it has been able to achieve positive operating cashflow since it can add appreciation in its [cashflow statement](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/cash-flow-statement "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/cash-flow-statement") to do so:

[![BRT - operating cash](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393771978142245.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393771978142245_origin.jpg)



BRT - operating cash (Seeking Alpha)





For example, even though it had a roughly -$2MM net loss for the quarter ending September, it also posted +$6.5MM in depreciation & amortization, which was added to cashflow from operating activities.

In addition, it has consistently achieved positive free cashflow/share for many quarters:

[![BRT - free cashflow per share](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393772426813018.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393772426813018_origin.jpg)



BRT - free cashflow per share (Seeking Alpha)





Thus, I believe that if these trends were to continue, this firm can continue to sustain its dividend as it has been doing, without an imperative need to cut it, since the positive cashflow is a factor to consider.

However, since earnings results do matter to many investors and being unable to turn a profit for so long could be at least some concern for downside risk if it continues, we will take a closer look at that next.

Earnings Headwinds Persist As Operating Income Comes Short
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to earnings, it is evident from the [income statement](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/income-statement "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/income-statement") that operating income is not enough to cover the quarterly interest expense on debt, hence creating net losses. In fact, it is not a single-quarter issue but is a consistent trend with this REIT.

![BRT - operating income](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-1739377546002971.jpg)



BRT - operating income (Seeking Alpha)





When considering that total operating expenses (which includes property expenses) were $21.5MM in the last reported quarter, that is nearly 87% of revenue. That is driving the $3.3MM of operating income, which does not cover the +$5MM of interest expenses that quarter.

Echoing this issue is [Seeking Alpha profitability data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/profitability "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/profitability") on this stock showing its interest coverage ratio is less than 1.0, which concerns me about the continued future ability of this firm to cover its interest payments:

[![BRT - interest coverage ratio](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-1739377885735312.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-1739377885735312_origin.jpg)



BRT - interest coverage ratio (Seeking Alpha)





Some financial industry experts, such as the [Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/interest-coverage-ratio/#:~:text=An%20ICR%20lower%20than%201,its%20short%2Dterm%20interest%20obligations. "https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/interest-coverage-ratio/#:~:text=An%20ICR%20lower%20than%201,its%20short%2Dterm%20interest%20obligations."), have said that "an ICR lower than 1 implies poor financial health, as it shows that the company cannot pay off its short-term interest obligations."

Further, with a [net income margin](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/profitability "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/profitability") of -9.78%, vs the sector average of +10.5%, this firm falls behind its overall sector in its efficiency at turning revenue into profits, I think.

To get some idea of what the company says about earnings potential going forward, and whether investors can hope for a turnaround, next I will highlight some points from the last quarterly results as well as macro factors to consider.

A Diversified Portfolio Expecting Continued Growth & Stability in Sunbelt Region
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to have a rough idea of what regions this REIT is focused on and why, and what could be some growth factors for the future.

From its [FY24 Q3 comments](https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Exhibit-99-1-Q3-2024-FINAL-Milestone-November-7-0415-pm.pdf "https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Exhibit-99-1-Q3-2024-FINAL-Milestone-November-7-0415-pm.pdf"), the company said the following:

> Long-term, the Company believes the Sunbelt offers compelling advantages due to the predominance of pro-business states, along with better population and job growth from migration patterns and business investment.

Further, we can see from the following geomap (from its [FY23 annual report](https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/brt-2023-annual-report.pdf "https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/brt-2023-annual-report.pdf")) a visual sense of the company's geographic diversification as of the end of 2023, and hence where they have been focusing on growth, with a focus concentrating on "Sunbelt" states of the US:

[![BRT - geo diversification](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393816979538376.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393816979538376_origin.jpg)



BRT - geo diversification (BRT 2023 annual report)





In fact, further company results indicate a slight YoY growth in average occupancy levels in several of those states including Texas, Virginia, Missouri and Alabama:

![BRT - YoY change in occupancy by state](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393817643695772.jpg)



BRT - YoY change in occupancy by state (BRT quarterly results)





While the firm is betting heavily on this Sunbelt region, it is notable to mention that its most recent results point to a property portfolio that is not overly concentrated in one state, but is spread across several states and a wide geography:

[![BRT - portfolio diversification](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393818949726033.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393818949726033_origin.jpg)



BRT - portfolio diversification (BRT - quarterly results)





From the data above, for example, we can learn that no one state in its portfolio is driving more than 16% of NOI (net operating income), a key metric tracked in the REIT business. In addition the weighted average occupancy levels are over +90% in all of the states in the portfolio.

I believe this geographic diversification is important since overconcentration in one city or state could increase downside risk in the future, since population migration trends can change over time but also new builders enter the market to meet the demand, creating competition for tenants.

The high levels of occupancy indicate rather stable rental markets for their portfolio, so next I want to talk briefly about some macro-level data that could point to future growth or decline in the Sunbelt region.

Consider that [Seeking Alpha data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/growth "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/growth"), such as forward revenue growth expected, for example, points to BRT achieving a +12.4% revenue growth expected as well as a +19.3% fwd EBITDA growth expected.

Macro Factors Are Positive For More Sunbelt Growth To Come
----------------------------------------------------------

In this section, I want to consider some macro-level data and factors that could help or hurt the future of the REIT particularly concerning population growth in the Sunbelt region of the US.

Back in [a 2023 article](https://www.newsweek.com/sunbelt-states-thriving-economy-struggles-1842406 "https://www.newsweek.com/sunbelt-states-thriving-economy-struggles-1842406"), national magazine Newsweek explained the population growth trends in the Sunbelt region:

> Investments in new plants and migration of people to these states bolstered their labor market compared to the Northeast and Midwestern states, which have struggled to retain workers they lost following the pandemic.

Echoing that point is [data from Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/12484/population-growth-in-the-united-states-by-federal-state/ "https://www.statista.com/chart/12484/population-growth-in-the-united-states-by-federal-state/") from Feb. 2024 that shows the southern states like Texas, Florida, and South Carolina, and to a lesser extent states like Tennessee and Georgia, are Sunbelt states that saw population growth from 2022 to 2023, which, I think, would have been favorable for REITs like BRT who focus on that part of the US since population growth can drive demand for apartment rentals.

![Statista - population change 2022-2023](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393829107284515.jpg)



Statista - population change 2022-2023 (Statista)





Looking ahead to future growth potential in this region, though, I turned to [an April 2024 study](https://www.clarionpartners.com/cpinsights/Documents/us-sun-belt-boom-2024-clarionpartners.pdf "https://www.clarionpartners.com/cpinsights/Documents/us-sun-belt-boom-2024-clarionpartners.pdf") by real estate investment firm Clarion Partners (a Franklin Templeton company), which forecasted continued growth in the region:

> Over the next decade, Sun Belt population growth is expected to remain steady growing by another 11 million (+7.0%), whereas non-Sun Belt states are forecasted to rise by only about 475,000 (+0.3%).

Additional data, this time from a [May 2024 research study](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends "https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends") by the Pew Charitable Trusts, and citing data from the University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center, points to population growth projections by US state through 2050:

[![population growth through 2050](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393841858852613.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393841858852613_origin.jpg)



population growth through 2050 (Pew research)





Notable from this data is that Sunbelt states I highlighted above like Texas, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia which are all projected to continue their trend of population growth even as some states (like West Virginia and Illinois) see population declines.

I believe this could provide future tailwind to REITs investing in those markets, which could be an upside factor for a stock like BRT, justifying the forward revenue growth projections I indicated.

Debt To Equity Higher Than Key Peers
------------------------------------

In this section, let's consider this firm's debt risk by comparing the debt/equity ratio vs some similar peers.

The peers used are 4 REITs that Seeking Alpha lists as peers in the multifamily residential segment, and all trading publicly on the NYSE:

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_6d6d0f481675ab9af9f21eefe46faf1e.png)

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com "https://ycharts.com")



Although with a D/E ratio of 2.3, BRT is on the higher end of this peer group, it remains equity positive, evident also on its [balance sheet](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/balance-sheet "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/balance-sheet"), unlike some peers like Clipper Realty ([CLPR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLPR "Clipper Realty Inc.")) who are operating with negative equity which I consider an added leverage risk.

When considering debt risk from another angle, the following table from the firm's [Q3 results](https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Exhibit-99-1-Q3-2024-FINAL-Milestone-November-7-0415-pm.pdf "https://s28.q4cdn.com/252903966/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Exhibit-99-1-Q3-2024-FINAL-Milestone-November-7-0415-pm.pdf") indicates a principal payment of +$74MM is coming up in 2026 just a year from now, so that could have a future impact to FY26 financial results.

[![BRT - principal payments](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393845943263638.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393845943263638_origin.jpg)



BRT - principal payments (BRT quarterly results)





In my research, I did not find any major credit rating agencies (S&P, Moody's, Fitch) providing recent rating coverage of this stock, so am not including a discussion of credit rating.

Trading Around Moving Average, and Slightly Undervalued vs Sector
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To get a sense of where the market has been pricing and valuing this stock, and therefore whether it presents an interesting buy, sell, or hold case, let's consider first the price chart.

The chart below compares the share price to its 200-day simple moving average, and its 5-year min and max:

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_9d5eceb55ffa48ae157fb4dc464b8143.png)

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com "https://ycharts.com")



It seems it is trading near its 200-day average now, and somewhere in the middle of the 5-year range, so not overly bullish or bearish, to put it in simple terms.

Since this is a REIT, a [valuation metric](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/valuation/metrics") I like to use is the forward P/FFO (price to funds from operations). For this REIT, its P/FFO fwd multiple is 15.29, around 12% below its sector average so not too undervalued vs its sector.

Its trailing price/book value is also around 1.59, pretty close to the sector average.

Although there does not seem to be a lot of analyst coverage on this stock, from available data it seems the [consensus](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/earnings/estimates "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRT/earnings/estimates") calls for a YoY EPS decline of -2.5% for FY24, but then a +7% YoY growth for FY25.

I believe the negative outlook for FY24 has depressed the valuation somewhat, including the fact that it is an unprofitable company. If the FY25 growth outlook actually occurs, that could present future upside as it could boost the future share price, especially if this REIT eventually reports a return to profitability.

Additional Risk Factor: Market Competition in Same City
-------------------------------------------------------

A risk factor not mentioned anywhere else in this article is competition from other apartment complexes in the same market, thereby negatively impacting future results.

For example, according to the firm's [supplemental data](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000014846/85b0e05e-c398-4ac5-9646-da88c62ce172.pdf "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000014846/85b0e05e-c398-4ac5-9646-da88c62ce172.pdf"), one of this REIT's properties in West Nashville has seen a negative impact to operating results as other properties become available in the same market. As the firm said:

> This property ("Bells Bluff") has experienced, and continues to experience, competitive pressure due to the completion of construction of similar or higher-quality multi-family properties in Nashville.

The after-effects of this competition are that "to maintain occupancy levels, we have offered, and anticipate that we will continue to offer, short-term rent concessions and/or reduced rental rates."

I believe the real estate sector is impacted by the dynamics of supply and demand, so a future downside risk could be new housing supply getting constructed in those markets that BRT invests in, and if an oversupply of housing occurs beyond the demand it will be less favorable for firms like BRT who then will have to compete for tenants by offering concessions and lower rents.

A Note About Interest Rate Risk and Real Estate Sector
------------------------------------------------------

One cannot talk about the real estate sector without at least considering the interest rate risk that can impact this segment of the economy that I believe relies heavily on debt financing to build and grow.

With that said, it is unclear when we will see those ultra-low interest rate environments from the past, which made the cost of debt financing cheap for real estate investors.

Using the Fed funds rate as an interest rate benchmark, according to [FRED data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS") even though that policy rate has reversed lately, it still remains significantly elevated when comparing to the period of 2015 through 2021, for example:

[![FRED - fed funds rate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393870675963905.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-17393870675963905_origin.jpg)



FRED - fed funds rate (FRED)





My opinion is that this could keep the cost of new debt financing, and refinancing, elevated for some time, which is not great for the real estate sector in general because it costs so much more to finance a property now, and growth of new properties in a portfolio is an important part of a REIT driving future revenue growth from new rents.

As far as the policy rate being cut.. not so fast.. since [CME Fedwatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html "https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html") shows a 97% probability of no cuts after the Fed's March meeting, but also a nearly 87% likelihood of the rate staying the same even after May.

Therefore, I consider the near-term interest rate environment in 2025 an elevated downside risk factor with greater weight and business impact for a firm like this who already has a poor interest rate coverage ratio and a high debt/equity ratio.

Conclusion Leads To A Neutral Rating
------------------------------------

Below is a summary of my rating notes discussed today, which led to the upside and downside ratings being equal on this stock, leading to a "hold" this time.

[![BRT - rating notes](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-1739387484028319.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/58572054-1739387484028319_origin.jpg)



BRT - rating notes (author)





While added weight was given to upside factors such as positive cashflow, macro data pointing to Sunbelt population growth continuing, and a diversified portfolio, what hurts this stock is the higher weight I put on the continual inability to generate a profit as well as the high-interest rate environment continuing.

For that reason, I am staying neutral on this stock and don't consider it a buy or sell now; however, it has been added to this week's dividend ideas due to its above-average dividend yield.
