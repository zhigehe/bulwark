Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:[JNJ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ "Johnson & Johnson")) has put its stroke care business up for sale, aiming for a valuation of more than $1B, the *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/b2a52b96-121e-469e-b4a3-5b6c3ab2994b) on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Putting up Cerenovus, which manufactures surgical equipment used to treat stroke patients, up for sale, is part of J&J’s attempts to reorganize its medical technology division. 

According to the report, the company has approached potential private equity and strategic buyers via advisers to test interest in Cerenovus. Cerenovus could fetch between $1B and $1.5B.

Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to a Seeking Alpha request for comment on the report.

J&J’s reported sale of the stroke business comes at a time when the company has been working to slim down and focus its operations. It has recently reorganized all its medical device units under the umbrella of its medtech division.

Johnson & Johnson ([JNJ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ "Johnson & Johnson")) shares were up 1.20% in Tuesday afternoon trade.
