Investment environment
----------------------

Global bonds slid as investors priced in an extension of the economic cycle and revised expectations for U.S. rate cuts in the face of inflation slowing less than expected. Sovereigns bore the brunt of the selling as evidenced by rates rising across the U.S. Treasuries curve. Better growth prospects and their potential impact on inflation caused the U.S. yield curve to steepen, with the 10-year note’s ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y)) yield finishing the period at 4.57%, roughly 33 basis points higher than that of the 2-year note. This pressure spilled over to investment-grade corporates given their interest rate sensitivity. Still, the expectation of the extension of the economic cycle caused the difference between corporate yields and those of their risk-free benchmarks to narrow.

Portfolio review
----------------

The portfolio seeks to generate consistent returns by focusing on higher-quality, shorter-dated credits that tend to offer attractive income generation – or carry – as they near maturity. The period’s returns were primarily generated by the carry earned on the portfolio’s core of shorter-duration corporate credits. The resetting of yields that occurred in the wake of 2022’s inflation surge resulted in bonds’ improved ability to generate sufficient income to compensate for modest rises in rates. Also contributing were derivates deployed to hedge against interest rate fluctuations. As rates rose during the quarter, this positioning resulted in positive returns.

After having taken profits on an earlier rally in bonds, the portfolio began the period with a duration of 1.01 years. Subsequent data have indicated that the U.S. economy remains on firm footing. With a steady labor market, expectations of pro-growth policies by the incoming administration, and concerns that inflation may not be fully defeated, the market dialed back its expectations for rate cuts in 2025. With few signs that policy rates could go higher in the U.S. and other regions still addressing flagging growth, we believe the bond market presented an opportunity to tactically raise duration to a level that captures incremental yield with minimal risk of rates surprising to the upside.

Consequently, we finished the period with a portfolio duration of 1.36 years.

Manager outlook
---------------

In assessing the prospects for global bonds in 2025, investors must consider the links between the shifting macro and policy environments. In the U.S., the combination of a resilient labor market and inflation falling perhaps not as rapidly as hoped has lessened the urgency to cut rates.

In many respects, the election of former President Donald Trump increased the likelihood of sustained economic growth, but it also introduced new uncertainties. While pro- growth initiatives, such as deregulation and tax reform, could spur investment and consumption, tariffs and trade barriers could be inflationary.

Already interest rates have taken notice. The U.S. Treasuries yield curve has risen across all tenors. Shorter- dated yields reflect a more subdued rate cut trajectory, and longer-dated yields have risen as investors account for the possibility that the battle to fully tame inflation isn’t over.

Facing floundering growth, European bond yields may continue to fall, representing an opportunity for capital appreciation along the front end of sovereign curves. In the U.S., any pro-growth initiatives or barriers to trade may alter the pace of inflation’s downward trajectory.

One must also consider what’s already been priced into markets. In the U.S., for example, the nominal yield on the 10-year note has risen considerably since mid-September, with rising expectations for inflation over the next decade accounting for a considerable portion of the increase.

Diverging economic prospects have implications for corporate credits. And with valuations elevated across the asset class, investors have the opportunity to seek out regions where stabilizing — or improving — economic conditions should fortify an issuer’s ability to meet its obligations. In contrast, where growth is more tenuous, richly valued and more cyclically exposed issuance is best avoided.

One way to navigate the still-uncertain economic environment is to focus on shorter-dated corporate issuance. Higher yields relative to much of the past 15 years have resulted in the potential to generate attractive returns due to the steeper roll down of these securities as they near maturity. Over these shorter time horizons, investors tend to have better visibility into an issuer’s ability to service its debts.

We expect to gain greater insight into President-elect Trump’s economic priorities during the early months of his administration. Pro-growth initiatives would likely keep Treasury yields high relative to global peers. The accompanying dollar strength would come at the expense of other currencies and also funnel a greater share of global investment toward the U.S. This could aggravate the economic positions of regions like Europe. And to the degree that this agenda would alter expected growth trajectories, it would inevitably influence the decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.

The longer a bond’s duration, the higher its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and vice versa. 10-Year Treasury yield is the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds that will mature 10 years from the date of purchase.  Basis point ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) equals 1/100 of a percentage point. 1 bp = 0.01%, 100 bps = 1%.  Carry is the excess income earned from holding a higher yielding security relative to another.  Monetary policy refers to the policies of a central bank, aimed at influencing the level of inflation and growth in an economy. It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. A yield curve plots the yields (interest rate) of bonds with equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. Typically bonds with longer maturities have higher yields.  Please consider the charges, risks, expenses and investment objectives carefully before investing.

Read it carefully before you invest or send money.  Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Discussion is based on the performance of Class I Shares.  The opinions are as of 12/31/24, are subject to change and may not reflect the views of others in the organization. Janus Henderson may have a business relationship with certain entities discussed. The comments should not be construed as a recommendation of individual holdings or market sectors, but as an illustration of broader themes.  Holdings are subject to change without notice.  Performance attribution is a method used to analyze and quantify the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its benchmark and does not represent actual performance. Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion.  **There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.**  **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Foreign securities** are subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  **Fixed income securities** are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. The bond market is volatile. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. The return of principal is not guaranteed, and prices may decline if an issuer fails to make timely payments or its credit strength weakens.  **Derivatives** can be more volatile and sensitive to economic or market changes than other investments, which could result in losses exceeding the original investment and magnified by leverage.  **ESG Integration.** As part of its investment process, portfolio management considers ESG risks and opportunities (“ESG Factors”) that it believes are financially material, alongside other fundamental investment factors. Examples of potential financially material ESG Factors include corporate governance, company culture, exposure to climate change, human capital management. To assess ESG Factors, portfolio management uses issuer reports, third-party data, and internally-generated analyses and may engage directly with issuers. ESG Factors are one of many considerations in the investment decision-making process and may not be determinative in deciding to include or exclude an investment from the portfolio.  **ESG Integration Risk.** There is a risk that considering ESG Factors as part of a Fund’s investment process may fail to produce the intended results or that each Fund may perform differently from funds that have a similar investment style but do not formally incorporate such considerations in their strategy. Information related to ESG Factors provided by issuers and third parties, upon which portfolio management may utilize, continues to develop, and may be incomplete, inaccurate, use different methodologies or be applied differently across issuers and industries. **Absolute return strategies** cannot ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss. An absolute return strategy may result in underperformance during a bull market.  **FTSE 3-Month US Treasury Bill Index** reflects the performance of short-term U.S. government debt securities.  Index performance does not reflect the expenses of managing a portfolio as an index is unmanaged and not available for direct investment.
