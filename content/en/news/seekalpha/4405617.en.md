Traders and investors are closely monitoring the upcoming inflation data set to be released later this week, with both the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index in the spotlight.

In light of this, Seeking Alpha has compiled perspectives from several of its analysts, offering a detailed analysis of Wall Street's current outlook as the CPI and PPI reports approach. With inflation remaining a major focal point for markets, all eyes are on the data for potential signals on future monetary policy and economic trends. 

See what SA analysts had to say below:

SA analyst Chris Lau stated: “The January 2025 CPI report will likely show some inflation, but not enough to alarm the Federal Reserve,” in [What To Expect From January 2025's Inflation Report](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756448-what-to-expect-january-2025-inflation-report "What To Expect From January 2025's Inflation Report").

SA analyst Damir Tokic mentioned: “Shelter inflation is gradually falling, as well as sticky inflation ex shelter, which is good news… However, there is a looming inflationary shock, based on Michigan year-ahead inflation expectations, due to tariffs,” in [January CPI Preview: Looming Inflationary Shock](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756405-january-cpi-preview-looming-inflationary-shock "January CPI Preview: Looming Inflationary Shock").

SA analyst Money Metals Exchange said: “Inflation expectations have been rising in response to tariff risks because companies facing higher import costs typically pass some or all of these expenses on to consumers, driving prices higher,” in [Surging U.S. Inflation Expectations Propel Gold Higher](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756363-surging-us-inflation-expectations-propel-gold-higher "Surging U.S. Inflation Expectations Propel Gold Higher").

SA analyst Dean Popplewell indicated: “A significant uptick in inflation expectations was seen with the release of the preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment data… Many people are worried that high inflation could make a comeback within the next year,” in [Markets Weekly Outlook - Inflation Fears Rise With Tariffs Ahead Of U.S. CPI Release](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756287-markets-weekly-outlook-inflation-fears-rise-tariffs-ahead-us-cpi-release "Markets Weekly Outlook - Inflation Fears Rise With Tariffs Ahead Of U.S. CPI Release").

As markets await the latest inflation data later this week, investors may choose to monitor both broader market averages and the Treasury space to better understand how inflation will impact the overall marketplace.
