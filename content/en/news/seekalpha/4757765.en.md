Kulicke and Soffa Industries (NASDAQ:[KLIC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLIC "Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc.")), a supplier of equipment and other solutions for the semiconductor and LED industry, delivered a mixed report on February 4. KLIC beat earnings estimates, and it continues to be optimistic the current downturn has mostly run its course, but guidance was also weaker than expected. KLIC is still waiting for the downturn to end and the longer it takes to get there, the greater the probability the stock will be weighed down more than it has, especially with the existing trend the stock finds itself in. Why will be covered next.

KLIC is still unable to get past resistance
-------------------------------------------

A [previous article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740338-kulicke-and-soffa-industries-green-shoots-may-not-be-far-away) from November 2024 noted how KLIC was in the midst of a rally. The stock was moving higher in an ascending channel, which might have convinced some to jump in on the rally in order to take advantage of momentum. However, the article also pointed out the stock was getting close to a potential resistance level, which could present a hurdle the rally might not be able to overcome. Accordingly, the article rated KLIC a hold.

The chart above shows why the article was correct to point out in November how the stock may not have much further to rally because the stock was unable to go much further, not longer thereafter. Note how in the chart above, the stock started to rally higher in September, only for the rally to stall in late November/early December. The stock spent some time trying to go higher, but it gave up after several attempts to turn south once more. Note also how the stock has been following the descending trendline lower for the last two months or so. If this trend holds, the stock is heading lower.

The chart above gives a clearer view of the dynamics at work. The stock hit resistance as the previous article speculated it might when it encountered the upper trendline in late November, which it was unable to overcome despite making several attempts to break through. The stock was then forced to take the path of least resistance by going down.

By respecting the boundaries imposed by the upper trendline, the stock reaffirmed the existence of the downtrend the stock finds itself in, defined by two descending trendlines. The stock may now be heading for a retest of the lower trendline if recent patterns are a clue. A bounce might be possible at that point, but this would not change the overall trend the stock finds itself in.

Why the Q1 FY205 report could not halt the decline in the stock
---------------------------------------------------------------

The stock has been heading lower, including in recent days, which the release of the latest or Q1 FY2025 report on February 4 was not able to stop. This is because while KLIC exceeded expectations in some areas, which included a sizable earnings beat, it came up short in other areas. For instance, KLIC was expected to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 on revenue of $165M, but KLIC earned $0.37, $0.09 more than expected, on revenue of $166.12M.

In terms of GAAP, KLIC reported net income of $81.64M or $1.51 per share, which looks much better, but it is worth mentioning that the GAAP numbers received a boost from a one-time gain worth $76M because a customer reimbursed KLIC for the impairment charge suffered in Q2 FY2024, a quarter in which KLIC reported a net loss of $102.7M or $1.83 per share due to the cancellation of a project KLIC was working on in collaboration with the customer in question.

Still, the bottom line got better because of higher margins, which benefited from several favorable developments, including favorable exchange rates, increased efficiency, which reduced costs, and because of revenue recognized for systems expensed in prior quarters. KLIC finished the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $538.3M, partially offset by total debt of $37.6M on the balance sheet. Note also how EPS gains got an assist from stock buybacks, which reduced the number of shares. The table below shows the numbers for Q1 FY2025.

| (Unit: $1000, except for EPS and shares) | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (GAAP) | Q1 FY2025 | Q4 FY2024 | Q1 FY2024 | QoQ | YoY |
| Revenue | 166,124 | 181,319 | 171,189 | (8.4%) | (3.0%) |
| Gross margin | 54.2% | 48.3% | 46.7% | 590bps | 750bps |
| Operating margin | 52.2% | 1.5% | 1.0% | 5070bps | 5120bps |
| Income (loss) from operations | 86,649 | 2,689 | 1,693 | 3122.4% | 5018.1% |
| Net income | 81,642 | 12,117 | 9,293 | 573.8% | 778.5% |
| EPS | 1.51 | 0.22 | 0.16 | 586.4% | 843.8% |
| Weighted average shares outstanding | 54,212K | 54,871K | 57,023K | (1.8%) | (4.9%) |
| (Non-GAAP) |  |  |  |  |  |

| Income (loss) from operations | 18,878 | 12,688 | 10,897 | 48.8% | 72.3% |
| Net income | 20,220 | 18,521 | 16,981 | 9.2% | 19.1% |
| EPS | 0.37 | 0.34 | 0.30 | 8.8% | 23.3% |

On the other hand, while the Q1 results were better than expected overall, quarterly guidance came in weaker than expected. The expectations were for non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 on revenue of $175M, but Q2 FY2025 guidance calls for non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, plus or minus 10%, on revenue of $155-175M. Remember that Q2 FY2024 was weighed by a large impairment change mentioned earlier, which skews the YoY comparisons.

|  | Q2 FY2025 (guidance) | Q2 FY2024 | YoY (midpoint) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $155-175M | $172.1M | (4.1%) |
| GAAP EPS | $0.03, +/- 10% | ($1.83) | - |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $0.19, +/- 10% | ($0.95) | - |

KLIC is unlikely to appeal to buyers if earnings do not get better
------------------------------------------------------------------

KLIC has earned $0.12 TTM in terms of GAAP, which translates to a P/E ratio of 342.7x with a stock price of $41.42. Non-GAAP is not better with TTM EPS of $0.11, mostly due to a loss of $0.95 a share in Q2 FY2024, which wipes out most of the $1.06 earned in the next three quarters, or about $0.35 per quarter.

However, if we set aside the distortions caused by Q2 FY2024, and assume earnings will stay flattish and continue at the quarterly run rate of the last three quarters or $0.35, then FY2025 EPS is on pace to end up at around $1.40. This implies a P/E of 29.6x, which look more palatable, but it is unlikely to cause buyers to jump in on KLIC.

What is more likely to get buyers excited is an end to the current downturn and clear signs of an upturn in demand. This should raise earnings, potentially even to the highs of the last upturn when GAAP EPS peaked at $7.09 in FY2022 and even higher in terms of non-GAAP. This level of earnings would result in a P/E in the single digits, which is certain to attract interest. However, there are no clear signs the downturn is over.

The recently completed Q1 FY2025 was actually the 11th consecutive quarterly decline in revenue and Q2 FY2025 guidance calls for that streak to be extended to 12, which is a full three years. At the same time, it is worth mentioning that KLIC seems to believe that, while the downturn remains, the downturn has mostly run its course because it has already lasted several years.

KLIC admits the industry continues to be in the process of digesting previous capacity expansions, which is affecting the quarterly results, but it also seems to believe the start of an upturn may not be so very far away. From the Q4 earnings call:

> “The General Semiconductor market continues to be largely in a state of capacity digestion, with Ball Bonder revenue sequentially lower from September as expected. We continue to expect we are in a late recovery stage; and remain positive on broader recovery through fiscal 2025."

Source: KLIC [earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755148-kulicke-and-soffa-industries-inc-klic-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript)

In fact, KLIC is optimistic FY2026 will be a more normal year due to being free of the need to digest previously bought equipment.

> “So that is really our expectation. Industry price will enter a normalized level maybe end of our fiscal '25. And when we enter '26, we expect probably full year will be a normalized year.”

If customers get back to normal ordering patterns, then that would be a strong signal the downturn is over and the upturn is not far away.

Is there a wild card that could disrupt the anticipated recovery?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The timing of the next upturn is crucial if betting on the stock is to pan out. KLIC seems to be optimistic the next upturn will come sooner rather than later, especially given the fact that the downturn has lasted for quite some time already. However, it is not impossible for the upturn to take longer to arrive.

KLIC relies on China for a large portion of its sales. According to the 2024 [annual report](https://investor.kns.com/annual-reports), China contributed $416.7M to FY2024 sales of $706.2M, or about 59%. In FY2022 when EPS reached its high, China contributed $855.4M to FY2022 sales of $1,503.6M, which is 56.9%. China has greatly assisted KLIC over the years in terms of demand, but this could prove to be a double-edged sword.

The number of equipment makers in China has grown over the years and the sophistication and variety of equipment they have on offer has greatly increased, especially in the last few years due to trade sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Chinese chipmakers. At least some of that equipment seems to be targeted at markets and/or customers KLIC is already serving with its equipment. Ongoing trade restrictions on Chinese chipmakers have caused them to diversify by looking for new suppliers, which opens the door for competition to KLIC.

It is not inconceivable for local equipment makers to snatch some of the orders that in past years would have gone to KLIC. This could affect the timing and the slope of the next upturn. Local competition in China could cause the next upturn to come later and turn out flatter than in past years. KLIC may have to rely less on China in a future upturn.

Investor takeaways
------------------

KLIC remains in a downturn that has caused equipment sales to drop to a much lower level compared to the heights of the last upturn in 2021-2022. Earnings have been even worse by shrinking to just a fraction of what they once were. The stock price has also been affected because it has been in a downtrend for some time.

Those who used to be long KLIC have been waiting for KLIC to get back to where it used to be, which requires an end to the downturn and the start of a new upturn. While the numbers have stopped declining, they are not getting much better. The latest guidance was typical in that regard as it called for sales to come in flattish QoQ at $155-175M, which disappointed the market and which negated the better-than-expected Q1 FY2025 results. The stock might have sold off more than it did if KLIC had not expressed optimism the downturn has mostly run its course during the earnings call.

However, it does not change the fact that the stock remains in the downturn it has been stuck in for the last couple of years. The prospect of another upturn has slowed down the descent, but a continued absence of clear signs the upturn is on the horizon will not stop the decline. Far from it, it is likely to cause the stock to drift lower. As things stand, the path the stock is most likely to take is to drift lower.

I have been long KLIC in the past, but in light of the latest report, I see no reason to be anything more than neutral on KLIC. KLIC may be right that FY2026, if not late FY2025, could see a major improvement in demand, but the present numbers are not encouraging. Q2 FY2025 is expected to extend the downturn with one more quarter.

The stock finds itself in a downtrend based on the charts, which by themselves suggest the stock price is going down, and the most recent report only strengthens the perception lower stock prices are likely in the pipeline. Multiples are on the high side and it is not at all certain when growth will return, which is needed to bring down those multiples.

If there is an upturn, whenever it may be, there is reason to question whether it will be as strong as previous ones. Previous upturns could count on strong demand from China to boost sales, but this may be different next time with new players on the scene that could snag some business away from KLIC. The last cycle saw GAAP EPS soar from $0.18 to $7.09, but if China does not contribute like before, the potential or ability of KLIC to improve on the current TTM EPS of $0.12 may not be as high as in the past.

In the end, a highly cyclical stock like KLIC is worth holding when there is an upturn because of the radical improvement to earnings that often accompanies these turns, which tends to cause the stock to go on an extended rally. If or when the next upturn comes, long KLIC will be worth taking into consideration, but not before.
