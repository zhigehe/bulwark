These acquisitions are projected to contribute approximately $145M in annualized revenues. The company is actively pursuing additional major acquisitions in 2025, particularly in the luxury and import sectors.
* Jeff Dyke, President, highlighted a strong balance sheet and liquidity to execute acquisitions without increasing debt, emphasizing, "We’ve got the liquidity to go out and do this without adding debt to our balance sheet."
* Consolidated total revenues reached an all-time quarterly record, up 9% year-over-year, accompanied by a 5% increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA.
* CFO Heath Byrd reported Q4 GAAP EPS of $1.67 per share, with adjusted EPS at $1.51, reflecting a 7% year-over-year decrease.
* Fixed operations gross profit achieved record quarterly growth, supported by the addition of 335 net technicians in 2024, exceeding the company’s goal of 300.
* EchoPark segment revenues were $506M, while adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $4.2M, below expectations due to inventory-related challenges.

### Outlook

* Same-store new vehicle GPU rose sequentially to $3,241, supported by the company’s luxury brand mix.
* EchoPark segment gross profit per unit increased $606 year-over-year to $3,004, despite a sequential decline in front-end used GPU due to inventory adjustments.
* Fixed operations gross profit on a same-store basis grew 12%, driven by higher warranty repairs and the successful technician hiring initiative.
