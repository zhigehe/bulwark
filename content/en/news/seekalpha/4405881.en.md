Earnings Call Insights: Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:[AMKR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMKR "Amkor Technology, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Revenue for Q4 2024 was $1.63 billion, with EPS of $0.43, aligning with prior guidance. Full-year revenue reached $6.3 billion, a 3% decline year-over-year, driven by weaknesses in the Automotive and Industrial segments.
* CEO Giel Rutten highlighted milestones, including a 3% year-over-year growth in Advanced Packaging revenue, Advanced SiP reaching $3.1 billion, and a record $1.2 billion in Computing revenue powered by AI GPUs and ARM-based PCs.
* The company qualified its new Vietnam facility for production and secured $407 million in CHIPS funding for its Arizona facility. Partnerships with TSMC and Infineon were expanded to support Advanced Packaging and power module initiatives, respectively.
* CFO Megan Faust stated, "Fourth quarter financial performance met expectations with all financial metrics within our guidance range." She detailed a gross margin of 15.1% and EBITDA of $302 million, with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of year-end.

### Outlook

* For Q1 2025, revenue is projected at $1.275 billion, a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily due to a temporary SiP socket gap in current iOS phones. Gross margin is expected between 10% and 13%, with net income forecasted at $23 million, or EPS of $0.09.
* For full-year 2025, the company anticipates flat to low single-digit revenue growth, supported by a muted first half and a stronger second half driven by content recovery in new iOS phones. Each end market is expected to remain flat or grow slightly year-over-year.
* CapEx for 2025 is forecasted at $850 million, with investments focused on high-performance computing, Advanced SiP, and test capacity, as well as the Arizona facility.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue of $1.63 billion compared to analysts' estimate of $1.66 billion, while EPS of $0.43 was above the estimate of $0.38.
* Gross profit for Q4 was $247 million, with a gross margin of 15.1%. Operating income reached $134 million, and net income was $106 million.
* Full-year 2024 EBITDA was $1.1 billion, achieving a 17.3% margin. Free cash flow for the year was $359 million.
* Vietnam facility ramp burdened gross margin by 80 basis points in Q4, expected to taper off through 2025, reaching breakeven by year-end.

### Q&A

* Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs: Asked about the impact of the SiP socket gap in iOS phones and the confidence in recovering content. CEO Rutten explained that recovery is expected in the next-generation iOS phones, with a Q3 2025 production ramp already planned.
* Joseph Moore, Morgan Stanley: Inquired about Automotive recovery. Rutten detailed strength in Advanced Packaging for ADAS and infotainment but noted that mainstream automotive products remain uncertain.
* Peter Peng, JPMorgan: Asked about diversification in AI customers. Rutten highlighted the ramp of a second 2.5D customer and qualification of RDL-based technologies, with production expected in 2025.
* Craig Ellis, B. Riley Securities: Questioned gross margin dynamics for 2025. CFO Faust pointed to tailwinds from higher-margin compute segments and gradual recovery in automotive and industrial segments.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about the muted first half of 2025, particularly regarding the Communications and Automotive segments. Questions reflected skepticism on recovery timing and the impact of geopolitical restrictions.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strong project pipelines and the potential for recovery across segments. CEO Rutten stated, "We have clear line of sight" regarding the recovery of the SiP socket in iOS phones.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained optimistic despite near-term challenges, while analysts appeared more cautious.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 shifted to flat to low single-digit growth compared to previous expectations of stronger growth. The Q4 2024 revenue decline was attributed to reduced Communications demand, contrasting with Q3’s strong SiP and wearables ramp.
* Management reiterated confidence in long-term technology leadership and customer partnerships despite geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds.
* Analysts' focus shifted from immediate market recovery to longer-term diversification and project pipeline execution.

### Risks and Concerns

* Prolonged Automotive and Industrial weakness, with seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines, remains a challenge. Management is optimistic about Advanced Packaging recovery but noted limited visibility for mainstream automotive products.
* Geopolitical trade restrictions impacted near-term growth in the Computing segment, particularly in AI GPUs.
* The Vietnam facility ramp is expected to constrain profitability in the short term, while the Arizona facility involves significant CapEx without immediate returns.

### Final Takeaway

Amkor Technology’s Q4 results aligned with guidance, but the company faces headwinds in Communications and Automotive markets. Management remains optimistic about a second-half 2025 recovery, driven by iOS content recovery and growth in AI-driven markets. CapEx investments in Advanced Packaging and geographic expansion are expected to support long-term growth, despite near-term challenges in profitability and market dynamics.
