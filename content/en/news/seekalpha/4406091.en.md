Semiconductor stocks were mixed in premarket trading on Tuesday after several companies in the industry released quarterly results.

GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:[GFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFS "GlobalFoundries Inc.")) shares fell 6.5% after the chip manufacturer [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406023-globalfoundries-non-gaap-eps-of-0_46-beats-by-0_01-revenue-of-1_83b-in-line "reported") mixed fourth-quarter results, but issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the coming quarter. Looking to the first-quarter, GlobalFoundries said it expects to earn between $0.24 and $0.34 per share on an adjusted basis, with the midpoint of $0.29 below the $0.33 per share estimate. Sales are forecast to be between $1.55B and $1.6B, below the $1.66B estimate. 

Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:[LSCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSCC "Lattice Semiconductor Corporation")) shares jumped 14.5% in early trading as it [offered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405846-lattice-semiconductor-non-gaap-eps-of-0_15-misses-by-0_04-revenue-of-117_42m-beats-by-0_36m "offered") up an upbeat outlook for the first-quarter of fiscal 2025. The company expects sales to be between $115M and $125M, with the $120M midpoint above the $118.75M consensus. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to be 69Z%, plus or minus 1%, while adjusted earnings per share are forecast to be between $0.20 and $0.24 per share. Analysts were expecting $0.21 per share in adjusted earnings.

In addition, Lattice CEO Ford Tamer [said](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405885-lattice-semiconductor-projects-15-percentminus-20-percent-revenue-growth-by-2026-amid-new "said") he expects a "U-shaped recovery" in 2025 and sees 15% to 20% growth by 2026. Lattice also [named](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405825-lattice-semiconductor-announces-new-cfo "named") Lorenzo Flores as its new CFO, effective immediately.

Following the results, a few investment firms raised their price targets on Lattice, including Benchmark and Raymond James.

Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:[AMKR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMKR "Amkor Technology, Inc.")) shares fell more than 10% in premarket trading after the semiconductor manufacturing company [offered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405995-amkor-slides-10-projects-lower-growth-for-2025-guides-q1-below-estimates "offered") up weaker-than-expected growth for the coming quarter. The company also said 2025 would be weaker-than-expected, due in part to less content in iPhones. In conjunction with the weak results and forecast, Melius and UBS cut their respective price targets on Amkor.

ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:[ON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON "ON Semiconductor Corporation")) shares were down fractionally in premarket trading as several investment firms cut their price targets on the silicon carbide semiconductor company, including UBS, Susquehanna, Deutsche Bank and Needham, after it [offered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405530-on-semiconductor-dips-as-q1-guidance-underwhelms-on-market-downturn "offered") up weaker-than-forecast guidance for the coming quarter.
