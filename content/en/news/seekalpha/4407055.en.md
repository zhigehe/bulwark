BASF SE ([OTCQX:BASFY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BASFY "BASF SE")) is asking banks to pitch the company for a potential initial public offering of its agricultural chemicals division.

The German firm is evaluating an IPO of the division in the US and could hire advisers in the coming weeks, according to a [Bloomberg report](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/basf-said-to-ask-banks-to-pitch-for-agri-chemicals-unit-listing "Bloomberg report") on Wednesday, which cited people familiar with the matter. The company is also considering Germany as a potential listing for the business. Any listing may occur as soon as next year.

BASF declined to comment to Bloomberg.

It was reported in September that BASF was planning a parti[al listing of its agricultural business](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4153175-basf-targets-partial-listing-of-agriculture-division-reuters "al listing of its agricultural business") because the stock market was underestimating the unit's earnings prospects within the group, CEO Markus Kamieth told staff at the time. The new CEO also said BASF would consider strategic options for its coatings business, which mainly caters to the car industry, including a potential joint venture or looking into having a different owner for the unit.
