![Blood samples for Liquid biopsy blood test to detect cancer cells or DNA fragments that circulate in the bloodstream, Lung cancer, laboratory background.](https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1418665854/image_1418665854.jpg?io=getty-c-w750) 



Md Saiful Islam Khan



Guardant Health (NASDAQ:[GH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GH "Guardant Health, Inc.")) is a diagnostics company trying to help conquer cancer with data. Guardant is facilitating early detection, precision oncology and recurrence monitoring through blood-based tests that provide access to cancer’s underlying molecular information. This is a $100+ billion opportunity, which was recently validated by the FDA’s clearance of Guardant’s CRC (Colorectal Cancer) screening solution.

The introduction of a single cancer screening solution is just the first step though, and the market appears to be overly focused on the efficacy of blood-based CRC tests versus existing solutions. Multi-cancer liquid biopsies will proliferate in coming years, enabling screening of a range of cancers at a reasonable price point, including those for which screening solutions don't currently exist. This will be a paradigm shift that completely changes the cost-effectiveness and overall health benefits of liquid biopsies.

With the future of the market now appearing relatively assured, Guardant’s success is likely to hinge primarily on competition, which comes from liquid biopsy startups, legacy cancer screening companies and genetic testing companies with a broader focus. While Guardant Health appears well positioned, scale is likely to become increasingly important over time, making the next few years critical. If Guardant can drive adoption of its CRC screening solution and continue expanding its product portfolio, its stock should perform well.

### Cancer

Cancer is the leading cause of death globally and has tremendous direct and indirect economic costs. For example, there were an estimated [18.1 million new cancer cases](https://www.who.int/cancer/PRGlobocanFinal.pdf "https://www.who.int/cancer/PRGlobocanFinal.pdf") and 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Cancers of the lung, female breast, and colorectum are the most common, while lung, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer result in the most deaths. The cancer burden is increasing globally, driven by a growing and ageing population, as well as changing environmental factors. Cancer is also more prevalent in Western countries, particularly the US.

The estimated total economic cost of cancer worldwide was $895 billion in 2008, excluding direct medical costs, with the lost years of life and productivity loss caused by cancer, representing the single largest drain on the global economy. It is therefore crucial for the healthcare industry to improve on current diagnostic and treatment methods.

Early detection is critical as it is highly correlated with patient outcomes and medical expenses. For example, metastatic cancer survival rates are only around 14%, compared to 90% for localized cancer and 65% for regionalized cancer. While screening can help with this, it is not available for all cancer types and compliance is often low.

In addition to the benefits of early detection, testing methods which provide an understanding of cancer’s genetic profile and how cancer responds to therapy can be used to guide treatment, lowering treatment costs and improving patient outcomes. This is becoming increasingly important as many newer treatment options are personalized and dependent on the cancer’s genetic profile.

Tissue biopsies are currently the most widely used tool for cancer detection, staging, and prognosis, but they have limitations. For example, tumor tissue can be difficult to obtain, and early detection is difficult. Other screening methods include mammograms, pap tests, colonoscopies and low dose computed tomography. These screening methods can have limited sensitivity and specificity though and only cover a subset of cancers.

 ![Example Cancer Screening Options](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/30/50485001-1738217235509092.png) 



Table 1: Example Cancer Screening Options (source: Created by author)



Blood-based tests are likely to come in at the high end of the price range for existing screening options, in part due to the cost of the test. They are also likely to suffer from relatively low sensitivity/specificity, which many consider a disqualifying factor for the technology. For some lethal cancers, like pancreatic and ovarian cancer, there isn’t a screening method available though, making blood-based tests an extremely attractive option.

In addition, some existing testing methods are invasive, or are disliked by patients, and have low compliance rates as a result. For example, there are 50,000 colorectal cancer deaths each year, with 76% of these occurring in individuals that are not up to date with screening, despite the existence of effective screening methods. In comparison, liquid biopsies have high compliance rates and are easy to administer amongst the high-risk population.

### Liquid Biopsy

A liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive method of detecting and managing cancer. It utilizes technologies like NGS (Next Generation Sequencing), PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and AI to detect ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) that has been released into the blood by tumor cells.

A liquid biopsy may also include detection of other cancer derived particles, including exosomes harboring tumor RNA, proteins and circulating tumor cells. Compared to a tissue biopsy, liquid biopsies are less invasive and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of tumor heterogeneity because all tumor sites release ctDNA into the blood.

ctDNA with NGS represents the majority of activity in the liquid biopsy space. There is also significant activity in capturing and analyzing exosomes, nucleosomes and circulating tumor cells, as these contain a broader selection of tumor derived analytes and may bring deeper insight into cancer biology. Capturing and analyzing immune cells is also emerging as a complementary technique.

[![Liquid Biopsy Targets](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726557665596.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726557665596_origin.jpg)

A liquid biopsy can be used throughout the cancer lifecycle, from screening healthy individuals through to profiling resistance, guiding treatment and monitoring for reoccurrence. Therapy guidance and recurrence monitoring are the leading applications today, but early detection is expected to represent the most sizable and impactful application in the future.

[![Liquid Biopsy Applications](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726568432767.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726568432767_origin.jpg)

#### **Asymptomatic**

The asymptomatic population refers to individuals who do not have cancer but are at risk due to inherited or environmental factors. Amongst the asymptomatic population, liquid biopsies can be used to identify cancer early and improve interventions. Using blood-based tests for screening is difficult though due to the extremely low concentration of ctDNA in blood for early-stage cancer.

Within screening, Guardant Health chose to initially focus on colorectal cancer, pitting its test against FIT (Fecal Immunochemical Test), mt-sDNA (multi-target stool DNA) and colonoscopies. An FIT uses antibodies to detect blood in stool and is typically performed annually. An mt-sDNA test, identifies DNA from cancer cells in the stool and also typically utilizes FIT to look for blood. This test is typically performed once every three years.

Exact Sciences’ ([EXAS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXAS "Exact Sciences Corporation")) next-gen Cologuard mt-sDNA test identifies 94% of CRC cases and 43% of advanced polyps with a 10% false-positive rate. While this is impressive, it still falls short of the 95% of CRC cases identified by a colonoscopy.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services consider any CRC blood-based screening test achieving a sensitivity of greater than 74% and a specificity [higher than 90%](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2824%2900305-6/fulltext "https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2824%2900305-6/fulltext") appropriate for reimbursement every three years. This determination was made based on the performance of FIT and mt-sDNA in CRC screening studies. While a number of companies have demonstrated this type of performance in CRC studies, the detection performance for colonic adenomas and serrated polyps (precursors to CRC) has been fairly poor. For example, Guardant Health’s ECLIPSE study only detected 13% of patients with lesions.

False positives could also become an issue as blood-based screening is scaled, with liquid biopsies generally having false positive rates in excess of 10%. This is both because of the anxiety induced by a false positive result and the potential for secondary screening of false positive patients to overwhelm system capacity (i.e. for colonoscopies).

From a clinical and cost-effectiveness perspective, liquid biopsies are therefore inferior to FIT, multi-target stool DNA, and colonoscopies. They are better than no screening though, which is important as compliance rates are low for CRC screening ([43-66% for other non-invasive stool tests](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2022/Guardant-Health-announces-positive-results-from-pivotal-ECLIPSE-study-evaluating-a-blood-test-for-the-detection-of-colorectal-cancer/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2022/Guardant-Health-announces-positive-results-from-pivotal-ECLIPSE-study-evaluating-a-blood-test-for-the-detection-of-colorectal-cancer/default.aspx")). Despite recommendations for universal screening, adherence to colorectal cancer screening in the US is only [approximately 60%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37971743/ "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37971743/"). In comparison, blood tests have a [90% completion rate](https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-benefits-and-risks-of-using-liquid-biopsy-for-crc-screening "https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-benefits-and-risks-of-using-liquid-biopsy-for-crc-screening") when a patient is prescribed the test.

As a result, the healthcare system appears to be supportive of blood-based tests for CRC, with CMS taking actions that should help to drive adoption. For example, coverage for a colonoscopy following a positive blood-based CRC screening test was recently expanded. The benefits of liquid biopsy could be negated if people switch from more effective forms of screening out of preference though.

#### **Treatment Selection and Prognosis**

After cancer diagnosis, ctDNA sequencing enables a tumor specific molecular profile to guide therapy selection. ctDNA also facilitates dynamic monitoring of a cancer’s treatment response to help identify the emergence of treatment resistance. In addition, some immunotherapies are known to produce different tumor response patterns from other systemic treatments, meaning the regular practice of monitoring therapeutic efficacy might not be appropriate. For NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ctDNA has been shown to be an early marker of therapeutic efficacy and could better predict survival outcomes.

Traditionally, access to a tumor's molecular profile required collection of tissue through a biopsy or surgery. This is often invasive, time-consuming and costly though, limiting its feasibility.

#### **Residual Disease and Risk of Relapse**

Even after successful treatment there is a significant risk of relapse for many cancer patients, a problem compounded by the fact that it can be difficult to detect residual disease in a timely manner using imaging or a tissue biopsy. Blood-based tests can detect residual disease several weeks earlier than radiologic imaging. In addition, patients who test positive for ctDNA have been shown to be at higher risk of relapse and exhibit worse outcomes (like shorter overall survival and disease-free survival time).

#### **Market Size**

Guardant's estimated addressable market is now in the vicinity of $100 billion, although this continues to drift higher, driven by both pricing tailwinds and a growing population of at-risk individuals.

For example, Guardant believes that the tissue-free MRD monitoring market now presents a $20 billion plus opportunity in the US, with less than 3% of over 15 million patients currently tested. Therapy selection is also now believed to be a $10 billion market, with around 700,000 patients. Roughly $2 billion of the therapy selection market is related to biopharma.

The vast majority of the blood-based testing opportunity comes from early cancer screening though, particularly multi-cancer screening. This is important given that Guardant Health is only just now starting to generate revenue from this part of the market.

#### **Sequencing**

Various methods have been proposed to reduce cost, background noise, and errors induced in the amplification step. Those methods can be categorized in different ways.

Based on the technique:

* PCR-based sequencing
* NGS-based sequencing

Based on the assay panel size:

* Single locus / multiplexed assays
* Targeted sequencing
* Genome-wide sequencing

PCR-based sequencing can be used for single-locus/multiplexed assays and targeted panels, while NGS-based sequencing can be applied to any panel size.

In a single locus assay only one target is amplified, whereas multiple targets are amplified in multiplexed assays. Using a targeted sequencing panel allows greater sequencing depth at lower cost, which provides greater confidence in low frequency aberrations. Targeted panels only provide a subset of the available information though. Genome wide sequencing provides more information, but this may come at a higher cost or smaller sequencing depth.

#### **PCR Based Methods**

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) refers to a method widely used in molecular biology to make several copies of a specific DNA segment. Copies of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified using PCR to generate thousands to millions of copies of that particular DNA segment. Liquid biopsies using PCR based methods are sensitive and inexpensive, but can only screen for known variants and speed is limited. PCR based methods can be divided into three major categories:

* Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
* Digital PCR (dPCR)
* Mass spectrometry

#### **Next Generation Sequencing**

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the sequence of nucleotides in a section of DNA. Next-generation sequencing is a broad term used to describe a range of modern sequencing technologies which allow for faster, more accurate sequencing of DNA and RNA at a lower cost, using smaller samples. NGS leverages novel biochemical workflows and parallel sequencing technology to fragment genomes, read genetic data, and reassemble the contents digitally. NGS is massively parallel, enabling high throughput, and can screen unknown variants.

Although targeted panels may be preferred for their high sensitivity and low cost, they can only detect point mutations and indels. One unique advantage of NGS is that it can be applied to the untargeted panel to find genome-wide DNA variation. WGS (Whole-Genome-Sequencing) is usually used to get the whole genomic profile of tumor DNA including point mutations, indels, rearrangements, and CNVs. WGS provides abundant information but is expensive and less sensitive. WES (Whole-Exome Sequencing) is a popular alternative to WGS which reduces cost by only sequencing the exons. WGS and WES both require high input sample volume, hindering their application in screening and early diagnosis when the concentration of ctDNA is low.

Rapid developments in next generation sequencing technologies have led to a dramatic reduction in sequencing cost along with improved accuracy. In recent years this decline in costs has far exceeded that predicted by Moore’s law and allowed costs to reach a point where commercial applications are viable. This decline in costs is being driven by an increase in sequencing volume and is likely to continue going forward as the commercial use of sequencing increases.

Liquid biopsies have also been enabled by ongoing improvements in computer hardware, which has dramatically reduced the cost to store and analyze large volumes of data.

#### **Methylation Sequencing**

Effective cancer screening should not only detect the presence of cancer, but also its location for follow-up diagnosis and treatment. In early-stage cancer, somatic mutations alone may not provide adequate information about the tumor site. Epigenetic information like methylation or protein biomarkers combined with ctDNA can help to determine tumor origin though.

Methylation sequencing techniques usually have a preprocessing step before sequencing. In addition to DNA conversion, the intention of the preprocessing step is enriching and selecting sequencing targets to reduce the cost.

#### **Alternative Markers**

Alternative markers (RNA, proteins, etc.) could also lead to improved liquid biopsy performance and pricing in the future.

Figure 5: Potential Blood-Based Markers (source: Guardant Health)



Repetitive RNA is a type of non-coding RNA that [can be an early sign of cancer](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2023/09/12/new-approach-to-liquid-biopsy-relies-on-repetitive-rna-in-the-bloodstream/ "https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2023/09/12/new-approach-to-liquid-biopsy-relies-on-repetitive-rna-in-the-bloodstream/") when circulating in the blood. In particular, circulating RNA molecules may help to detect liver, esophagus, colon, stomach, and lung cancer. A genetic mutation that occurs early in the formation of some cancers causes the secretion of RNA molecules in large quantities. Typical approaches to analyzing RNA don't look at repetitive RNA though, which has limited its use in diagnostics so far. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning models trained using repetitive RNA can improve performance.

Proteins can also provide insight, although their use is complicated by the large number of potential proteins, the wide range of protein concentrations in samples and a lack of scalable proteomics tools. In particular, proteins could provide more organ specific information, helping to identify cancer origin. Proteomics tools must be both high throughput and capable of analyzing upwards of hundreds of proteins simultaneously. Solutions include mass spectrometry, immunoassays and Edman Degradation.

Alternative biomarkers represent both a threat and an opportunity. Technology could change the basis of competition, weakening Guardant’s position in the market. Improved test performance would likely drive adoption though and could result in higher pricing. The use of additional biomarkers also doesn't necessarily lead to improved test performance. For example, [Guardant assessed protein biomarkers](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2022/Guardant-Health-announces-positive-results-from-pivotal-ECLIPSE-study-evaluating-a-blood-test-for-the-detection-of-colorectal-cancer/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2022/Guardant-Health-announces-positive-results-from-pivotal-ECLIPSE-study-evaluating-a-blood-test-for-the-detection-of-colorectal-cancer/default.aspx") in its ECLIPSE study and found that a cfDNA-only test outperformed a cfDNA test with protein biomarkers.

Guardant clearly retains an interest in this area though, having invested [$26 million](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/asia/lunits-ai-boosts-guardant-healths-cancer-detection-capability "https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/asia/lunits-ai-boosts-guardant-healths-cancer-detection-capability") in Lunit’s Series C funding round in 2021. Lunit has developed a scoring algorithm for PD-L1, a protein that helps regulate the body’s immune response. Lunit’s solution improves the detection of PD-L1 by over 20% compared to manual pathologist interpretation. Guardant plans on integrating Lunit’s algorithm into its non-small cell lung cancer test.

### Guardant Health

Guardant Health offers a range of blood-based tests that are used to detect and characterize cancer. The first version of Guardant360 (therapy selection) was [launched in 2014](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript"), with Guardant subsequently introducing Guardant Reveal (recurrence monitoring) in 2021 and its SHIELD asymptomatic cancer screening solution in 2024. The company's product portfolio also includes:

* **Guardant360 TissueNext** - identifies actionable biomarkers in tumor tissue to guide therapy selection in patients with advanced cancer.
* **Response** - tissue-free MRD (Minimal Residual Disease) detection test.
* **GuardantOMNI** is a genomic profiling tool that aims to accelerate clinical development programs.
* **GuardantINFINITY** is a solution leveraging Guardant's smart liquid biopsy platform that is targeted at biopharma customers. It offers improved performance and aids in areas like novel biomarker discovery and signature development.
* **Guardant360 CDx** - CGP panel with guideline-recommended biomarkers and indications in lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer.

Guardant continues to conduct trials and publish data in support of expanded Medicare reimbursement and FDA clearance for additional indications. This includes breast, lung, pancreatic and gastric cancer, with [data expected over the next year](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript").

Guardant combines the analysis of genomic, methylation and fragmentomic signatures to detect a broad range of cancers, including at their earliest stages. Methylation is a key determinant of epigenomic state, which controls how cells function. Many of these epigenetic changes occur early in tumorigenesis and are highly pervasive across tumor type. This allows DNA methylation cancer biomarkers to be suitable for early detection and also to have utility across a range of areas relevant to cancer detection and treatment.

Fragmentomics refers to the study of circulating DNA fragments and often involves the characterization of fragment size profiles. The study of cfDNA fragment length, an indirect measure of nucleosome positioning, has recently been shown to have good clinical utility. Fragmentomics can help to identify cancer and the tissue of origin, a particular important consideration in pan-cancer screening. Guardant Health acquired Bellwether Bio enabling it to include nucleosome positioning and fragmentomics information in its ctDNA analysis.

[![Cancer Signals in ctDNA](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726561787534.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726561787534_origin.png)

While it is difficult to separate the different liquid biopsy companies based on their products and technology, Guardant appears to be a leader based on scale and test performance. In particular, the company highlights its biochemistry and bioinformatics as areas of strength. Guardant's high-conversion biochemistry provides a 2-3x improvement in efficiency and its AI-powered bioinformatics provides a 1,000x reduction in sequencing error rates.

[![Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Platform](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726575675013.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726575675013_origin.png)



Figure 7: Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Platform (source: Guardant Health)



Guardant also continues to iterate on its technology in support of test performance. For example, Guardant360 capabilities have been boosted by Guardant's smart liquid biopsy platform, which offers expanded genomic and epigenomic capabilities. Guardant can now evaluate more biomarkers and quantify disease burden at much higher sensitivity.

Test performance is likely to continue improving over time, driven by biochemistry, sequencing technology and access to more data. Guardant has now performed hundreds of thousands of tests and generated petabytes of data, and this data could provide a sustainable competitive advantage.

[![Guardant Tests and Data Generated](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374746549800582.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374746549800582_origin.png)

Guardant offers tests for therapy selection, recurrence monitoring and screening, as well as solutions for biopharma companies.

#### **Therapy Selection**

In addition to detecting the presence of cancer, diagnostics can also help to characterize a cancer and reveal potential weaknesses. Because cancer drugs work in different ways, some will do well against a tumor with one set of mutations but ineffective against others. This is becoming more important as the prevalence of targeted therapies increases.

 ![Cancer Characterization](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374748655888016.png) 



Figure 9: Cancer Characterization (source: Guardant Health)



Targeted therapy works by targeting the cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. These genes and proteins are found in cancer cells or in cells related to cancer growth, like blood vessel cells. Drugs can block or turn off signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide, keep cells from living longer than normal and destroy the cancer cells.

Guardant Health offers two liquid biopsies for therapy selection in advanced cancer. Guardant360 was launched in 2014 and has been used by more than 5,000 oncologists and over 40 biopharmaceutical companies. Based on the number of tests sold in 2017 Guardant Health believes Guardant360 is the global market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test. Guardant launched its upgraded Guardant360 test in late July 2024. It expands the [number of genes by nearly 10x](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") and improves the sensitivity for tumor burden detection by a factor of 10.

Clinical studies show that Guardant360 matches tissue testing detection rates and delivers a faster turnaround time. Guardant360 measures 73 cancer-related genes from ctDNA and has been used over 70,000 times by oncologists to help inform which therapy may be effective for advanced stage cancer patients with solid tumors. Clinical adoption of Guardant360 is still only in the mid-single-digits though, with fewer than 15% of patients receiving any kind of comprehensive genomic profiling either by tissue or by liquid.

Guardant's NILE study demonstrated that [Guardant360 is as effective](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2019/NILE-Study-Results-Demonstrating-Guardant360s-High-Concordance-to-Tissue-Testing-in-Advanced-NSCLC-Published-in-Clinical-Cancer-Research/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2019/NILE-Study-Results-Demonstrating-Guardant360s-High-Concordance-to-Tissue-Testing-in-Advanced-NSCLC-Published-in-Clinical-Cancer-Research/default.aspx") as tissue testing in detecting NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) biomarkers. Guardant360 is also as capable of detecting microsatellite instability as traditional tissue methods across multiple solid tumor types. The results from Guardant360 were the same as the standard-of-care tissue test in [98.4% of cases](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2019/Largest-Study-of-its-Kind-Finds-Guardant360-MSI-Highly-Concordant-to-Tissue/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2019/Largest-Study-of-its-Kind-Finds-Guardant360-MSI-Highly-Concordant-to-Tissue/default.aspx"). For advanced cancer patients, MSI is a good predictor of response to immunotherapy.

Increased reimbursement coverage has been one of the key drivers of increased adoption of Guardant360. Guardant Health initially focused on non-small cell lung cancer and reimbursement by Medicare for lung cancer patients started in the fourth quarter of 2018. Continued investments along with collaborations with leading cancer centers and pharmaceutical partners have led to clinical evidence supporting the platform across dozens of cancer types.

[![Guardant 360 Reimbursement Coverage](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726561469712.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726561469712_origin.png)



Figure 10: Guardant 360 Reimbursement Coverage (source: Guardant Health)



GuardantOMNI was launched in 2017 and is tailored for immuno-oncology and targeted therapy development. Industrywide, nearly 70% of the oncology drug development pipeline in 2016 was for immunotherapies and targeted therapies. GuardantOMNI's panel incorporates the vast majority of all genes and biomarkers being evaluated in cancer drug development pipelines, including tumor mutational burden. Biopharmaceutical companies can utilize GuardantOMNI to ensure patients in their clinical studies have cancer with the right molecular profile. As GuardantOMNI is a more comprehensive test it has a higher selling price than Guardant360. Guardant has a cumulative total of over 160 biopharma partnerships, including 19 of the top 20 pharma companies. There is significant potential for growth in this segment as the biopharma industry currently has more than 1,000 trials with a collective need to enroll over 100,000 patients annually and growing.

CDx tests are used as companions to therapeutic drugs in order to determine their applicability to particular patients. Guardant's biopharma solutions provide an attractive entry point into this market and Guardant has multiple active CDx collaborations. This could be a valuable business in time given the growth of targeted therapies.

#### **Recurrence Monitoring**

Blood-based tests can also be used to monitor for ctDNA post-surgery to detect recurrence early on and identify patients with residual disease who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. This is a large opportunity as less than 3% of the [18 million cancer patients](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Receives-Medicare-Coverage-for-Guardant-Reveal-on-Smart-Liquid-Biopsy-Platform-for-Surveillance-Testing-in-Colorectal-Cancer-Patients/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Receives-Medicare-Coverage-for-Guardant-Reveal-on-Smart-Liquid-Biopsy-Platform-for-Surveillance-Testing-in-Colorectal-Cancer-Patients/default.aspx") in the US who would benefit from MRD monitoring are currently being tested. Lung cancer was the lead indication for Guardant Reveal. The largest indications in MRD are breast cancer and CRC though.

Guardant Health has a tumor naïve approach whereas many competitors have a tumor informed approach. For a tumor informed assay there are logistical challenges of finding an old tumor and personalizing an assay based on what is found in that tumor tissue. This is important given that data suggests more than three million patients do not have tumor tissue available. It is also questionable whether a tissue biopsy is representative of entire tumor, particularly if heterogeneity is high.

There are two potential regulatory pathways for obtaining approval to market liquid biopsies:

* 510(k)-clearance through the FDA
* LDT (Laboratory Developed Test) through CMS

CMS provides a less restrictive regulatory pathway although this is commercially limited. While Guardant is generating data in support of Reveal, the company hasn't sought FDA approval and is therefore considered an LDT.

Guardant’s COSMOS study evaluated Reveal for MRD detection and demonstrated [81% longitudinal sensitivity](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2024/Guardant-Health-COSMOS-Study-Published-in-Clinical-Cancer-Research-Validates-Utility-of-Guardant-Reveal-Liquid-Biopsy-Test-for-Predicting-Recurrence-in-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2024/Guardant-Health-COSMOS-Study-Published-in-Clinical-Cancer-Research-Validates-Utility-of-Guardant-Reveal-Liquid-Biopsy-Test-for-Predicting-Recurrence-in-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx") for recurrence in stage II or higher colon cancer. Reveal also showed a 5.3-month median lead time from ctDNA detection to recurrence. The study assessed more than 1,900 longitudinal surveillance samples from 342 patients with stage I-III resected CRC.

Reveal has also demonstrated 100% specificity and a [median lead time of 7.9 months](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/guardant-reveal-ctdna-test-shows-high-sensitivity-in-colorectal-cancer "https://www.targetedonc.com/view/guardant-reveal-ctdna-test-shows-high-sensitivity-in-colorectal-cancer") from detection to disease recurrence in breast cancer. The test was also able to detect ctDNA up to 28.6 months prior to recurrence.

Guardant recently [received Reveal Medicare coverage](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Receives-Medicare-Coverage-for-Guardant-Reveal-on-Smart-Liquid-Biopsy-Platform-for-Surveillance-Testing-in-Colorectal-Cancer-Patients/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Receives-Medicare-Coverage-for-Guardant-Reveal-on-Smart-Liquid-Biopsy-Platform-for-Surveillance-Testing-in-Colorectal-Cancer-Patients/default.aspx") for recurrence monitoring in CRC patients after curative intent treatment. This is a meaningful expansion from the prior coverage of Reveal that only included the early post-surgical setting.

Beyond CRC surveillance, Guardant has an extensive pipeline of clinical cohorts for establishing the validity and utility of Guardant Reveal. Guardant hopes that this will eventually lead to expanded reimbursement and influence a change in practice guidelines.

#### **Early Detection**

Within early detection, Guardant Health chose to initially focus on colorectal cancer as the company believed that there was a critical gap in the screening landscape. Despite CRC being the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US, screening rates amongst higher risk individuals remains stubbornly low. The incidence of CRC amongst younger individuals is also increasing, creating a need for improved screening methods

[![CRC Screening Engagement in the US](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17375029277480798.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17375029277480798_origin.png)



Figure 13: CRC Screening Engagement in the US (source: Guardant Health)



Guardant's ECLIPSE study was designed to evaluate the ability of its assay to detect colorectal cancer and advanced neoplasia’s during screening. The study was initially going to enroll 10,000 individuals aged between 50 and 84 or at average risk of colorectal cancer. This figure was later increased to 13,000 in order to ensure that there were enough positives to create statistically significant results, a problem that increases with rarer cancers. The direct and indirect costs associated with the trial were expected to total $70-$100 million.

In the ECLIPSE trial, Guardant’s test [demonstrated 83% CRC sensitivity](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") and 90% specificity. Stage I sensitivity was only 55% though, and advanced adenoma sensitivity was only 13%. The low advanced adenoma sensitivity is a particular point of concern when considering the potential adoption of blood-based tests for CRC screening.

[![Guardant CRC Screening Sensitivity by Cancer Stage](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726562318594.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726562318594_origin.png)



Figure 14: Guardant CRC Screening Sensitivity by Cancer Stage (source: Guardant Health)



Shield Version 2 uses an improved algorithm that enables the detection of tumor signs at roughly 2x lower levels. As a result, sensitivity is significantly improved, particularly for early-stage cancer. Advanced adenoma performance is fairly similar though, which could indicate that this is due to a fundamental limitation of the blood-based approach.

[![Clinical Sensitivity of Shield V2](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-1737504028205093.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-1737504028205093_origin.png)



Figure 15: Clinical Sensitivity of Shield V2 (source: Guardant Health)



While the performance of blood-based CRC screening tests has raised questions about their value, Shield's CRC performance is well within the recommended non-invasive test range (74-92% sensitivity and 87-96% specificity). Inferior test performance must be weighed against the fact that blood-based tests have much higher adherence rates than other screening methods.

[![Illustrative Life-Years Gained from Blood-Based CRC Screening](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-1737503947815968.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-1737503947815968_origin.png)



Figure 16: Illustrative Life-Years Gained from Blood-Based CRC Screening (source: Guardant Health)



Shield recently received [approval for CRC screening](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") in adults aged above 45 who are at average risk for the disease. It is the first blood test that has been approved by the FDA as a primary screening option for CRC and is also covered by Medicare. The product was commercially launched in August, with Guardant initially focusing on the covered patient population.

Early post launch volumes have reportedly been ahead of internal expectations and Guardant continues to see adherence rates in excess of 90%. The company was targeting a trained sales force of over 100 people in the field by the end of 2024 in support of Shield, meaning 2024 volumes are probably not indicative of the product's true potential.

Shield received a Medicare price of $920, which should lead to an ASP of roughly $500, even before ADLT (Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory Test) designation, which would result in a Medicare price of $1,495 in 2025. CMS has also finalized the policy to remove follow-on colonoscopy cost sharing for Medicare beneficiaries after a positive blood-based screening test, removing a barrier to adoption.

Guardant had been targeting [$500 million in Shield revenue](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") in 2028, assuming a $500 ASP, with recent favorable outcomes, this target now appears conservative. Guardant had also been working under the assumption that it would receive something more like a second line label and that there would be competition early on, both of which are now invalid. Competition is probably at least 2.5 years behind Guardant’s mid-2024 launch.

While early volumes have been modest, Guardant is still in the process of building its screening business. Once the company has scaled its sales force, developed relationships and built awareness, growth is likely to be strong compared to Guardant's other solutions. This can be seen from how rapidly Exact Science's Cologuard volumes grew, despite poor consumer acceptance of stool-based tests. Guardant needs USPSTF guidelines to drive private payer reimbursement though, which isn't expected until 2026.

[![Oncology Test Volumes](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/5/50485001-1738809655758833.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/5/50485001-1738809655758833_origin.png)

Shield was recently [selected by the Abu Dhabi Department of Health](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Healths-Shield-Test-Selected-by-Abu-Dhabi-Department-of-Health-for-Blood-Based-Colorectal-Cancer-Screening-Program/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Healths-Shield-Test-Selected-by-Abu-Dhabi-Department-of-Health-for-Blood-Based-Colorectal-Cancer-Screening-Program/default.aspx") for its blood-based CRC screening program. The agreement was arranged by Guardant's partner in the Middle East, Hikma Pharmaceuticals. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer amongst Abu Dhabi's nearly 4 million population, with 63% of cases diagnosed at a late stage. The program is expected to screen approximately 10,000 people in its first year.

Guardant now plans on expanding Shield to include lung cancer and eventually multi-cancer screening. Lung cancer makes sense as an expansion market as there are around 150,000 lung cancer deaths annually, with 86% of eligible individuals unscreened. There are approximately 8 million individuals in the US who are at high risk for lung cancer, providing a large market. Guardant is on track to complete Shield-Lung enrollment of [10,000 individuals](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4394556-guardant-health-announces-prelim-q4-revenue-above-estimate "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4394556-guardant-health-announces-prelim-q4-revenue-above-estimate") in 2025, with the first endpoint readout expected in 2026. Individuals enrolled in Shield-Lung are high risk for lung cancer and either current or former smokers.

Guardant also wants to be the first FDA approved and reimbursed multi-cancer test. The company is now enrolling 10,000 cancer-free individuals for a multi-cancer detection study. A 2-year clinical follow-up period could put the company’s data readout into 2027/2028 though. In comparison, GRAIL's ([GRAL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRAL "GRAIL, Inc.")) current target timeline likely puts FDA approval of its multi-cancer early detection test somewhere in the first half of 2027. GRAIL certainly appears to be ahead at this stage, but it is not clear that its lead is large enough to provide a meaningful advantage.

Guardant's [Shield was recently selected](https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Shield-Platform-Selected-for-Inclusion-in-National-Cancer-Institutes-Vanguard-Study-to-Evaluate-Emerging-Technologies-for-Multi-Cancer-Detection/default.aspx "https://investors.guardanthealth.com/press-releases/press-releases/2025/Guardant-Health-Shield-Platform-Selected-for-Inclusion-in-National-Cancer-Institutes-Vanguard-Study-to-Evaluate-Emerging-Technologies-for-Multi-Cancer-Detection/default.aspx") by the National Cancer Institute's Vanguard Study to evaluate technologies for multi-cancer detection. The four-year study will assess the feasibility of using multi-cancer detection tests in cancer screening clinical trials and will enroll up to 24,000 people. Guardant was one of two participants selected and was assessed on its ability to detect 10 types of cancer in a blinded reference set.

### Financial Performance

Guardant Health continues to generate high revenue growth with no sign of slowing down. This growth is being driven by increased adoption of liquid biopsies, a growing product portfolio, wider reimbursement coverage and pricing tailwinds.

Guardant's Q3 revenue totaled [$191.5 million](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript"), up 34% YoY. Precision oncology was an area of strength, supported by Guardant360 reimbursement tailwinds and broad-based volume growth. Biopharma revenue was also up 40% YoY to $39.4 million from 10,500 tests. Development services and other revenue totaled $10.9 million. Shield screening revenue currently falls under the development services and other line item but Guardant plans on separately reporting Shield revenue and volume from Q4 onwards.

Guardant expects an acceleration of Guardant360 volume growth in 2025 and strong growth from Reveal and TissueNext. As a result, oncology clinical volume growth is expected to [accelerate above 20%](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") in 2025, even without the boost provided by Shield.

Guardant is targeting in excess of $2 billion revenue in 2028, implying greater than a 30% CAGR in the coming years. Over the same period, the company is also expecting more than 20% annual growth from therapy selection and MRD.

[![Guardant Health Revenue](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726571320662.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726571320662_origin.jpg)



Figure 19: Guardant Health Revenue (source: Created by author using data from Guardant Health)



Clinical test [volumes totaled 53,100](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") in the third quarter, up 21% YoY, with Guardant360 growing by mid-single-digits sequentially. Reveal also continues to generate strong growth, despite Guardant managing volumes ahead of broader reimbursement and the achievement of positive gross margins. Clinical test volume is specific to Guardant’s oncology tests (Guardant360, TissueNext, Response, and Reveal) and does not include screening test volumes from Shield.

[![Guardant Penetration of the US Advanced Cancer Market](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17375043549519336.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17375043549519336_origin.png)



Figure 20: Guardant Penetration of the US Advanced Cancer Market (source: Guardant Health)



Revenue growth is also being supported by pricing. Guardant360 ASPs reached [$3,000 in the third quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript"), with the Guardant360 LVT Medicare rate rising from $3,500 to $5,000. Guardant has upgraded its TissueNext test, enabling it to identify more treatment options for patients with advanced cancer. Interest in the expanded panel is reportedly strong, and Medicare pricing will increase from $3,100 to $3,500 in 2025. Shield also recently received favorable Medicare pricing ($920 per test).

Table 2: Guardant 2028 Target ASPs (source: Created by author using data from Guardant Health)



Guardant Health has a high margin business, and this is becoming increasingly clear as they commercialize their technology. Development services has a slightly high gross profit margin than precision oncology but both of these segments are likely to have gross profit margins in the 70-80% range in the long run.

Guardant is targeting gross margins [in excess of 60%](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") for its MRD business long term. Reveal currently has negative gross margins though, and Guardant is limiting volumes as a result. Positive gross margins are expected in 2025, with Guardant targeting a reduction in COGS and higher ASPs after reimbursement.

Guardant has also suggested $200 COGS for Shield when processing one million samples per year, which likely means gross margins in the 70% range at scale. The company had been targeting 60% Shield gross margins based on one million annual tests and a $500 ASP.

[![Guardant Health Gross Profit Margin](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726570130095.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17374726570130095_origin.jpg)



Figure 23: Guardant Health Gross Profit Margin (source: Created by author using data from Guardant Health)



Guardant's operating expenses are currently elevated due to investments in future growth, which is hiding the underlying economics of its business. The company has more recently demonstrated significant operating leverage though as some of its investments begin to pay off. This is likely to continue in the future, moving the company closer to bottom-line profitability.

Losses also vary significantly across the company's various initiatives, dependent on maturity. For example, Guardant's therapy selection business is now consistently cash flow positive.

R&D costs are likely to remain high in the mid-term due to clinical trials and near-term sales and marketing expenses will be elevated as Guardant scales its commercial teams ahead of screening revenue growth. Guardant has suggested that cash burn associated with Shield will be around [USD200 million per year](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734072-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript").

Figure 24: Guardant Health Operating Expenses (source: Guardant Health)



Guardant had around $1 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, which the company believes will be sufficient for it to reach cash flow breakeven by 2028.

Guardant was also recently awarded nearly $300 million by a North California jury in a false advertising lawsuit against Natera. Natera disagrees with the jury’s decision though and plans on contesting it.

### Competitors

There are a large number of public and private companies competing in the liquid biopsy market. They range from large pharmaceutical companies like Roche to small pure play oncology diagnostic companies like Freenome. The focus of these companies varies widely across sequencing chemistry, cell capture technology, and the stage of cancer targeted.

The main competitors at this point in time are probably GRAIL, Exact Sciences and Natera ([NTRA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTRA "Natera, Inc.")). GRAIL is targeting multi-cancer early detection and is possibly the leader in this area. Exact Sciences has a background in mt-sDNA testing but is expanding into blood-based testing. Natera's early focus was on non-invasive prenatal testing, but the company has built a large MRD business in recent years.

It is difficult to compare these companies at this stage, as they have their own strengths and weaknesses. Guardant is potentially the best positioned blood-based testing company when its product portfolio is viewed as a whole though. From a test performance perspective, Guardant also appears to be a leader. This is another area where it is difficult to compare companies due to the way that data has been reported. Some companies are also still relying on observational studies, which are likely to provide flattering data. Exact Sciences and Natera have scale from their CRC screening and NIPT businesses respectively though.

GRAIL has chosen to target the multi-cancer early detection market from the outset. This approach is expensive and eliminates early revenue from easier segments, like precision oncology. A first mover advantage in this part of the market could be decisive given its size though.

### Valuation

Guardant Health's commentary suggests that growth will be far stronger than current consensus, with growth likely to accelerate in coming years as Guardant expands its presence in MRD and screening. I estimate that Guardant's 2028 revenue is likely to come in closer to $2.2 billion if the company can hit its targets. If Guardant can achieve this sort of growth, there is likely to be significant multiple expansion. Even without this, solid double-digit growth and Guardant's likely margins at scale mean the stock should perform well in coming years.

 ![Guardant Health Analyst Revenue Projections](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/21/50485001-17375058086695402.png) 



Table 5: Guardant Health Analyst Revenue Projections (source: Created by author using data from Seeking Alpha)



Guardant Health’s current leadership position in treatment selection is probably not enough to justify its current share price. The company also needs to have success in recurrence monitoring and/or screening, which I believe it is well positioned for. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis estimate Guardant Health’s intrinsic value to be approximately $100 per share.

Conclusion
----------

Guardant has already built a sizeable business within precision oncology. This is the smallest of its opportunities though. The company's MRD business should begin to gather pace in 2025 on the back of expanded reimbursement and a transition to gross margin profitability. Guardant's screening business will also start to generate meaningful revenue over the next few years, which is important given this is where much of the company's future value lies.

There is a lot of skepticism around Guardant's screening business at the moment, which stems from the efficacy of blood-based testing versus existing options. While blood-based tests offer inferior performance, adherence rates are much higher, creating better overall outcomes.

The focus on CRC is misplaced anyway, as the market will evolve towards pan-cancer tests. In addition to higher adherence rates, these tests will cover many cancers for which there are currently no screening options available. There will still be an issue around managing false positive volumes, but at that point, liquid biopsies will offer a compelling cost-benefit tradeoff.

While there is undoubtedly a large growth opportunity, there is still uncertainty around competition and profitability. I believe that Guardant will be highly profitability at scale, with the cost of conducting large clinical trials providing a significant barrier to entry. Guardant's current losses are the result of investments and are in no way a reflection of the underlying economics of its business. Guardant's precision oncology business has already transitioned to profitability and the others will follow in time.
