One of the surprising consequences of the Fed's interest rate cuts has been that longer-term yields - and thus, mortgage rates - have remained high. Evidently, the market believes that rates will need to go up in the future again to combat persistent inflation. But even more surprising amid high mortgage rates is the fact that real estate prices have remained stubbornly high, as supply remains muted and homeowners are wary of switching out to a new home at much higher rates.

Benefiting from the boost of rental demand, as well as higher rental pricing, is AppFolio (NASDAQ:[APPF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APPF "AppFolio, Inc.")), one of the largest software providers for commercial property managers. Over the past year, shares of AppFolio are now down nearly 10%: despite the fact that it's a "Rule of 40" stock that has turned in consistent performance. The company just released strong Q4 results and issued robust guidance for the current year FY25, and the post-earnings correction

[I last wrote a bullish note on AppFolio in October](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4729897-appfolio-capturing-tremendous-economies-of-scale), when the stock was still trading in the low $210s. Since then, AppFolio has given up much of its post-election rally- but at the same time, the company has continued to make strong advances in growth while also touting strong adoption of its AI copilot features. With this in mind, I'm reiterating my **buy** rating for AppFolio.

In my view, AppFolio benefits from secular tailwinds as renting has become more and more appealing, especially to the millennial and younger generations for whom owning a home has either become out of reach or no longer a focal financial goal. The company also benefits from increasing urbanization: as more and more people cluster in cities (reversing the pandemic-era of suburbanization as remote workers fled cities in search for space), multifamily property managers are becoming even more prevalent.

Here is my full long-term bull case for AppFolio:

* **AppFolio's portfolio covers various stakeholders in the real estate industry.** The utility of AppFolio's product platform spans across property managers, residents, and real estate investors - a truly complete solution for the entire commercial real estate ecosystem.
* **All in one platform with multiple products.** The company's software suite is broad, covering functions ranging from tenant communications, accounting and billing, work order fulfillment, leasing and advertising, and real estate investor updates.
* **Recurring revenue stream.** The company earns revenue from both subscription fees from property managers while also taking a cut for payment processing, making its monthly revenue streams as reliable as rent.
* **Rule of 40.** AppFolio balances ~20% revenue growth with ~20% pro forma operating margins, positioning the stock firmly as a "Rule of 40" company that deftly balances growth and profitability.

Stay long here: AppFolio's potential remains quite broad.

### Q4 download

Let's now go through AppFolio's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:

[![AppFolio Q4 results](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/31/33427965-1738331755553729.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/31/33427965-1738331755553729_origin.png)



AppFolio Q4 results (AppFolio Q4 earnings release)





AppFolio's revenue grew 19% y/y to $203.7 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $200.0 million (+16% y/y) by a three-point margin, while unfortunately also decelerating from a 24% y/y growth pace in Q3. That being said, AppFolio is becoming a victim of its own scale: as the company nears ~$1 billion in annual revenue in FY25, we can't expect the company to grow at a mid/high 20s pace in perpetuity.

Worth noting is that within the fourth quarter, AppFolio acquired a company called LiveEasy for $80 million. [LiveEasy is a concierge service](https://myhome.liveeasy.com) that gives its customers guidance throughout the process of moving to a new home, covering installations such as home security and solar, while also collecting quotes for insurance and internet. The company didn't disclose LiveEasy's revenue contribution within the quarter, but in my view, this offering aimed at consumers will further extend AppFolio's broad portfolio reach.

The company notes that not only is it onboarding more commercial property managers, but it's also driving growth via upselling more of its customers to its higher-priced subscription tiers. Per CEO Shane Trigg's remarks on the [Q4 earnings call:](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753658-appfolio-inc-appf-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript)

> Core solutions revenue was $47.6 million in the fourth quarter, a 15% year-over-year increase driven by growth in new customers and total units under management. In addition as I mentioned earlier, we continue to win larger customers and more customers are choosing our Plus and Max plans.
> 
> At the end of the year, we managed approximately 8.7 million units from 20,784 customers compared to 8.2 million units from 19,737 customers a year earlier. This represents a 6% increase in ending units and a 5% increase in customers as we continue to emphasize residential portfolios."

On the profitability front, we do note that pro forma operating margins declined by 4 points y/y to 20.2%:

AppFolio margins (AppFolio Q4 earnings release)





The company benefited from its decision to waive eCheck fees for its customers, which provided an additional fee revenue stream and improved gross margins; however, added spending from absorbing LiveEasy as well as a customer conference that moved from Q3 to Q4 offset this benefit. Still, for the full year, the company's pro forma operating margins more than doubled to 25.2%, and importantly, the company is still guiding to further improvement in FY25.

### Valuation and key takeaways

At current share prices near $215, AppFolio trades at a market cap of $7.83 billion. After we net off the $278.3 million of cash (against no debt) on the company's latest balance sheet, AppFolio's resulting **enterprise value is $7.55 billion.**

Meanwhile, for the current fiscal year FY25, AppFolio has initiated a guidance range of $920-$940 million, representing a growth range of 16-18% y/y. It's also expecting a 24.5-26.5% pro forma operating margin, or 30bps of expansion at the midpoint. We note that this is likely a conservative estimate to kick off the guidance cycle for FY25, but even if this guidance holds firm, AppFolio still remains a "Rule of 40" company in FY25 despite its growth deceleration.

[![AppFolio outlook](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/31/33427965-17383317929319685.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/31/33427965-17383317929319685_origin.png)



AppFolio outlook (AppFolio Q4 earnings release)





Taking the midpoint of guidance at face value, AppFolio trades at **8.1x EV/FY25 revenue.** Needless to say, AppFolio isn't exactly a value stock, but its positioning as a Rule of 40 company and one of the leading software providers in the real estate industry do afford the stock a premium.

My price target on AppFolio is **$285,** representing 11x FY25 revenue and ~30% upside from current levels. Stay long here, but keep an eye out for valuation and don't miss your chance to sell on the next leg higher.
