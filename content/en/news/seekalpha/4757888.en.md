Investment Overview — Crispr Therapeutics Q4 & FY24 By The Numbers
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Crispr Therapeutics AG** (NASDAQ:[CRSP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRSP "CRISPR Therapeutics AG")) [announced](https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-provides-business-update-and-reports-12) its Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings on Tuesday 11th February. In Q4, the company reported $35m of collaboration revenue, down from $200m in the Q4 2023, and for the full-year, also $35m, down from $370m in 2023. Grant revenue of $2.3m was also reported in 2024.

R&D expenses in Q4 and full-year 2024 respectively came to $82.2m and $321m, versus $95m and $387 in the prior year periods. G&A costs were $18.1m and $73m, broadly the same as last year, and loss from operations $(65m), and $(467m) respectively, versus a $60m profit in Q4 2023, and 2023 annual loss of $(222m).

Thanks to “other income” (primarily interest income) of $28m in Q4 and $104m in 2024, net losses amounted to $(37m) and $(366m) respectively, versus $89m profit, and $(154m) loss in the prior year periods.

While losses in 2024 were substantially higher than in 2023 — primarily due to the collaboration revenues CRISPR Therapeutics earned from partner Vertex in relation to the approval of Casgevy in December 2023 — the company has few financial concerns. It reported $298m of cash, and $1.6bn of marketable securities, versus $389.5m cash, and marketable securities of $1.3bn at the end of 2023.

### Analysis: Still No Casgevy Revenue Breakdown? Why This Ought Not Be A Concern

I have to admit, I raised an eyebrow when studying Crispr Therapeutics' results. I was expecting to see some details of Casgevy's revenue performance since it was approved to treat Sickle Cell Disease (“SCD”) in December last year, and to treat transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”) on 16th January 2024.

As a reminder, here is a description of how Casgevy works taken from the Q4 2024 earnings [press release](https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-provides-business-update-and-reports-12):

> CASGEVY is a non-viral, *ex vivo* CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy for eligible patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are edited at the erythroid specific enhancer region of the *BCL11A* gene.
> 
> This edit results in the production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth.
> 
> CASGEVY has been shown to reduce or eliminate recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) for patients with SCD and transfusion requirements for patients with TDT. CASGEVY is approved for certain indications in multiple jurisdictions for eligible patients.

Clinical studies of Casgevy indicated that it can provide a practically “functional cure” for SCD and TDT. 94.2% of TDT patients able to remain transfusion free (TDT patients may typically be required to visit a hospital every few weeks to receive a transfusion and maintain hemoglobin levels) for up to 59.4 months, and 92.3% and 97.3% SCD patients able to remain either vaso-occlusive crisis (“VOC”, a painful complication of mis-folded sickle cells that often requires hospitalization) free, or in-patient hospitalization free for up to 54.8 months.

Treatment with Casgevy is a lengthy process. However (I have covered the treatment journey in a previous post), that can take up to a year, with patients hospitalized for months as their cells are extracted, sent to a lab, engineered, and re-infused, followed by regular appointments with physicians to monitor recovery.

Perhaps this explains why there are no revenue figures as yet. In its earnings press release Crispr Therapeutics disclosed:

> As of the end of 2024, more than 50 authorized treatment centers (ATCs) have been activated globally, including centers in all regions where CASGEVY is approved, and more than 50 patients have already had at least one cell collection across all regions. The number of new patients initiating cell collection is expected to grow significantly throughout 2025

Besides the US, the therapy is approved in Great Britain, the EU, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the Kingdom of Bahrain (Bahrain), Canada, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and apparently patients from all regions have had cells collected.

Casgevy is priced at ~$2.2m per patient, so we might speculate that once each of the ~50 current patients' treatment is complete, revenues will be recorded, and the figure will be ~$110m. Crispr Therapeutics shares profits with its partner Vertex ([VRTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated")), the Boston-based Pharma best known for its double-digit billion Cystic Fibrosis Franchise, 60/40 in favor of Vertex, so would earn ~$44m.

During a [fireside chat](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755267-crispr-therapeutics-ag-crsp-guggenheim-smid-cap-biotech-conference-transcript) at the Guggenheim SMID Cap Biotech conference earlier this month, Crispr Therapeutics CEO Samarth Kulkarni discussed booking Casgevy profits — or losses — as follows:

> I think the way it’s going to show up for us on our P&L is a single line item at this point because it’s a net cost and you see this as a collaboration expense and when the franchise becomes profitable you’ll see that as the net profits attributed to us become net revenues essentially.

When questioned on profitability, the CEO suggested:

> what people don’t understand is that only a part of those expenses are what you need to have a commercial infrastructure and to sell the product. A large part of the investments that we’re making right now essentially are to expand manufacturing capacity, as well as to continue our trials

However, the CEO did add that Casgevy ought to eventually drive “relatively attractive gross margin,” and that he felt that “potentially by 2028 we could be breakeven as a company.”

Once the target 75 ATCs are up and running, and let's speculate each one treats 25 patients per annum, that's 1,875 patients per annum in total, multiplied by $2.2m is $4.125bn, multiplied by Casgevy's 40% share equals $1.65bn of revenues per annum.

### Easing The Casgevy Preconditioning Regime Can Exponentially Increase Number Of Patients Treated

At present, given that patients must undergo a “pre-conditioning” regime — specifically myeloablative busulfan conditioning — which is similar to chemotherapy, before their cells can be extracted, it may not be surprising if patients are reluctant to try Casgevy, even if the rewards outweigh any risks (to date, the therapy's safety profile has proven strong, although there is a significant risk of infertility thanks to the pre-conditioning).

The next frontier for Crispr Therapeutics and partner Vertex ([VRTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated")) is to find ways to ease or eliminate the pre-conditioning regime. Here are some comments from CEO Kulkarni, again speaking at the recent Guggenheim conference (there was no Q4 earnings call with analysts):

> with gentler conditioning, the way it works is we have our own efforts essentially that we have an ADC (antibody drug conjugate) where we acquired the antibody from another company. It’s an antibody towards c-Kit or CD117 and then we have our own toxin that we’ve conjugated to that antibody and so we’re developing that for gentler conditioning.
> 
> Vertex have said that they have other agents that they’re developing not just one but multiple agents towards gentler conditioning efforts and so we’re going to put it all together and see what’s the best and ultimately bring that to bear for patients.

Crispr Therapeutics and Vertex are still at an early stage of development. In this regard, with no assets in the clinic yet, this is a space worth watching as a more benign pre-conditioning would triple, or even quadruple the addressable market, the companies estimate.

Then, looking even further ahead, the prospect of “in vivo” administration — using injected lipid nanoparticles to guide the CRIPSR therapy to its target, which would require no pre-conditioning, and potentially no time in hospital, is the “holy grail.” That is not just the case for Casgevy, but across many of Crispr Therapeutics' other pipeline projects, which we'll now take a closer look at.

### Crispr Therapeutics Pipeline Set To Flourish In 2025?

Crispr Therapeutics has been working with cell therapies — similar to Casgevy in terms of the pre-conditioning, cell engineering, cell infusion approach — but has ultimately opted to prioritize “allogeneic” therapies. This is an approach that uses engineered cells from a donor, rather than a patient's own cells.

CTX112 is an anti-CD19 allogeneic CAR-T therapy indicated for B-cell malignancies and for the autoimmune condition systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”), while CTX131 is an anti-CD70 allogeneic CAR-T indicated for renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and other solid tumors, and hematological cancers.

There are no allogeneic therapies approved today, while there are plenty of approved autologous — patient, not donor cell derived — cell therapies approved, earning billions of dollars per annum between them. That's primarily because of the risk that a patient's immune system rejects donor cells, leading to potentially fatal complications such as graft vs. host disease (“GvHD”).

In its 2024 annual report / [10K submission](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4711467-crispr-therapeutics-q2-earnings-casgevy-updates-underline-blockbuster-potential), CRISPR explains the unique qualities of its two next-generation candidates and why they may succeed where so many allogeneic therapies have fallen short:

> 1.Elimination of the T-cell receptor, or TCR, to reduce the risk of Graft versus Host Disease, or GvHD.
> 
> 2.Site-specific insertion of a CD19-directed CAR (for CTX112) or CD70-directed CAR (for CTX131) into the TRAC locus.
> 
> 3.Removal of the class I major histocompatibility complex, MHC I, from the cell surface to improve the persistence of the CAR T cells in an “off-the-shelf” setting.
> 
> 4.Disruption of Regnase-1 to increase functional persistence, cytokine secretion and sensitivity, and effector function.
> 
> 5.Disruption of TGFBR2 to reduce tumor microenvironment inhibition of multiple CAR T cell functions.
> 
> 6.For CTX131 only, knock-out of CD70 to prevent CAR T cells from killing other CAR T cells and further increase potency.

The 10K also discusses recent CTX112 data that elicited responses in six out of six patients previously treated with T-cell engager therapies, and “dose-dependent cell expansion with Cmax comparable to approved autologous CAR T products.” An update from the clinical study of CTX131 is expected this year, in solid tumors.

It's the in-vivo pipeline that may provide the most meaningful data readouts in 2025, however, as shown below (slide taken from a recent corporate presentation):

in vivo pipeline updates (presentation)





Earlier this year, Sana Biotechnology ([SANA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SANA "Sana Biotechnology, Inc.")) revealed that it had successfully transplanted UP421, its allogeneic primary islet cell therapy engineered with its proprietary hypoimmune (“HIP”) technology into a patient with type 1 diabetes without the use of any immunosuppression.

Sana stock [leaped >250% on the news](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748320-sana-biotechnology-stock-price-rise-deserved-post-diabetes-cell-therapy-success). Crispr has its own diabetes program running along similar lines. While no data has been promised in 2025 (a Phase 1 clinical study is ongoing) the wider fact that an in-vivo therapy has been successfully administered to a patient — Intellia Therapeutics ([NTLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTLA "Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.")) achieved something similar back in 2021 — offers hope that Crispr Therapeutics, never usually far behind in any gene therapy development race, could report success in 2025 from any one of four different studies.

Concluding Thoughts: Investors Need To Be Patient — There Is Still So Much Promise
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crispr Therapeutics' share price has oscillated between ~$40 and ~$80 since the beginning of 2022. It previously reached highs of >$200 per share and >$150 per share, primarily related to the promise of Casgevy and Vertex's ~$900m payment to increase its share of Casgevy profits from 50%, to 60%.

The irony is that now Casgevy has aced its pivotal studies and is approved in multiple territories, the share price cannot catch a break, albeit, it gained 10% yesterday on the back of a solid set of earnings and business updates.

The Crispr / Cas9 gene editing approach — which I have not discussed in detail here but have covered in detail in [previous posts](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736088-crispr-therapeutics-q3-earnings-no-casgevy-revenue-but-plenty-of-optimism) — has come in for some criticism, due to progress having been slower, and costs higher, than might have been hoped.

The reality is, however, that concepts such as “functional cures” for diseases that formerly plagued patients for their entire lives, “allogeneic” cell therapies that could be prepared rapidly and safely for patients with oncological or autoimmune diseases, or an “in vivo” therapy that would require potentially a single visit to a physician's office, and single injection to provide a permanent cure, are still tremendously exciting and valuable ideas that may be within reach.

Unlike other companies working with CRISPR/Cas9, Crispr has brought an extremely valuable therapy in Casgevy all the way to market, showing in the process that it is the most dynamic CRISPR/Cas9 drug developer out there.

I also disagree with those who criticize the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. The reality is that gene editing itself is not the hard part — there are several ways this can be done, and CRISPR/Cas9 is certainly one of them — the hard part is drug delivery.

Crispr is making solid headway addressing this issue with lipid nanoparticles — like those used in the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer ([PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) and Moderna ([MRNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRNA "Moderna, Inc.")), gentler preconditioning, and allogeneic therapies. That's why I typically look beyond the day-to-day share price movements, and instead focus on the progress of the science and the studies.

By 2028, Crispr Therapeutics could be a billion dollar revenue company through Casgevy alone. This more than justifies the current market cap in my view (don't forget the $1.6bn of cash either), while the remainder of its pipeline, if projects are successful, could easily add another $10bn to the market cap.

A more sobering take is to look at Sana's market cap valuation of <$650m, despite its in-vivo success, apply a dose of realism, and wonder if these drug developers can achieve the lofty goals they have set themselves.

This perspective will put off many investors, and likely keep the share price down, but if you are a believer in the work Crispr is doing, like I am, you'll keep holding its stock and monitoring progress.

With some major data readouts upcoming in 2025, and potentially some meaningful Casgevy revenues also later in the year, this does not feel like a bad time for shareholders to be adding to their position.
