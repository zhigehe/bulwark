Equity returns in Brazil and other countries are outstripping that of U.S. stocks so far in 2025, with Bank of America saying investors are looking beyond the U.S. exceptionalism theme.

The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) has risen ~2.7% this year through midday Friday. That increase is behind 12% and 10% gains in Brazil and Germany, respectively, BofA said. Chinese, U.K. and Australian equities were each returning 6%, and Canadian stocks were clocking in a 4% return.

“International stocks front-running peak U.S. exceptionalism,” Bank of America investment strategists led by Michael Hartnett said in their Flow Show note Friday.

Investors are looking at the potential of “geopolitical peace” in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine, and betting on a lack of escalation in the [U.S.-China trade war](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403017-yales-budget-lab-sees-223-hit-to-average-american-household-from-trumps-china-tariff "U.S.-China trade war") - the “only one that matters,” Hartnett said.

BofA has been cautioning about a peak in the U.S. exceptional theme that’s fueled longstanding outperformance of U.S. stocks over international markets. The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) rose more than 20% in 2024 and 2023.

The theme is nearing its peak as investors in an “exceptionally expensive” U.S. market see excess federal fiscal spending, a fading “bubble” in AI capital expenditures, and immigration curbs, BofA said last week. Hartnett, who coined the Magnificent Seven” term, said last week the group is at risk of morphing into the [“Lagnificent Seven”](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401535-the-lagnificent-seven-us-exceptionalism-is-expected-to-peak-bofa "“Lagnificent Seven”").
