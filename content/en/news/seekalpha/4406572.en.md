Earnings Call Insights: CoreCivic (NYSE:[CXW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXW "CoreCivic, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Damon Hininger highlighted significant growth opportunities tied to the recent change in the presidential administration, including increased demand from federal agencies such as ICE and the U.S. Marshal Service. He noted that recent legislation, such as the Laken Riley Act, could necessitate up to 110,000 additional detention beds.
* Hininger emphasized proactive measures, including $40M-$45M in capital expenditures, to prepare facilities and transportation resources for potential new contracts with ICE. He stated, "We are leaning forward on expenditures for facility CapEx and transportation assets."
* CFO David Garfinkle noted that adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $0.16, exceeding average analyst estimates by $0.06. Normalized FFO per share was $0.39, surpassing estimates by $0.05. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $74.2M.
* President Patrick Swindle discussed operational improvements, including occupancy reaching 75.5%, the highest since Q1 2020, and reduced reliance on expensive temporary labor.

### Outlook

* Management anticipates steady increases in federal populations throughout 2025. Guidance for 2025 includes diluted EPS of $0.48-$0.61 and FFO per share of $1.37-$1.50. Additionally, $40M-$45M is allocated for potential facility activations.
* Hininger mentioned ICE-specific proposals for 28,000 beds, which could generate up to $1.5B in revenue, depending on utilization.
* The company is preparing for potential idle facility activations, which could take 4-6 months to operationalize.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue totaled $479.3M, reflecting a 2% decline compared to the prior year. Excluding closed facilities, underlying revenue growth increased 8% year-over-year.
* Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $90M in Q4 2023 to $74.2M, partly due to the termination of contracts at the South Texas Family Residential Center and the California City Correctional Center.
* Federal revenue from ICE declined 22%, but excluding the South Texas facility, ICE revenue increased 5% year-over-year. Revenue from state partners grew 6.4%, driven by new contracts with Montana and Wyoming.
* Garfinkle highlighted reduced operating expenses, including an $8.3M decline in costs related to temporary labor.

### Q&A

* Joe Gomes, Noble Capital Markets: Questioned ICE capacity needs and alternative solutions like Guantanamo or El Salvador. CEO Damon Hininger responded that ICE's capacity requirements could range from 150,000 to 200,000 beds and emphasized CoreCivic's value proposition, including cost efficiency and readiness.
* Greg Gibas, Northland Securities: Asked about the breakdown of available ICE beds and margin implications. CFO David Garfinkle explained that 13,000 beds are in idle facilities, with additional capacity at operational sites. He noted that margins at idle facilities would stabilize above 25% once fully utilized.
* Ben Briggs, StoneX Financial: Inquired about Montana's new RFP and ICE's electronic monitoring program. Management confirmed active engagement in both opportunities and noted significant investments in technology and personnel.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on ICE contract opportunities and CoreCivic's ability to meet demand. Skepticism arose around startup costs for idle facilities and potential delays in ICE funding.
* Management's tone was confident, particularly regarding operational improvements and proactive measures for federal contracts. Hininger repeatedly emphasized readiness, stating, "We are exceptionally well positioned."
* Compared to Q3, the tone was more upbeat, reflecting anticipation of policy-driven demand increases under the new administration.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 2024 saw a decline in adjusted EBITDA from $83.3M in Q3, primarily due to the termination of high-margin contracts. However, normalized FFO per share and adjusted EPS both exceeded Q3 levels.
* Management's tone shifted positively, with greater focus on growth opportunities tied to ICE and the U.S. Marshal Service.
* Analysts continued to prioritize ICE-related questions, but concerns about startup costs and contract timing persisted.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted uncertainties regarding ICE contract timing and funding, which could delay facility activations.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential startup expenses for idle facilities, which could temporarily impact margins.
* Dependence on federal policy changes and funding increases remains a significant risk.

### Final Takeaway

CoreCivic is positioning itself for significant growth opportunities in 2025, driven by increased federal demand for detention capacity under the new administration. With 28,000 ICE beds proposed, potential revenue could reach $1.5B. Despite lingering uncertainties regarding contract timing and startup costs, management's proactive measures and operational improvements signal readiness to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
