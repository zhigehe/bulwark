Boeing (NYSE:[BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA "The Boeing Company")) on Saturday said it was cutting staff in its Space Launch System that is part of NASA’s Artemis program to bring humans back to the moon for the first time in 50 years. The aviation giant said it expects to eliminate 400 jobs amid revisions to the program and its costs.

Affected employees will receive 60-day notices of the involuntary layoffs in the coming weeks, the company said.

Artemis's launches were estimated to cost $93 billion through 2025. During his first term, President Donald Trump approved of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration program to bring astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission.
