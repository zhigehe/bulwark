T-Mobile (NASDAQ:[TMUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS "T-Mobile US, Inc.")) has [launched public beta testing](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996142-t-mobile-starlink-beta-takes-off "launched public beta testing") of the first space-based mobile network in the U.S. powered by SpaceX's ([SPACE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPACE "SpaceX")) Starlink.

The beta trial is open for all wireless users in the U.S. - including customers of rival telecom firms Verizon ([VZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ "Verizon Communications Inc.")) and AT&T ([T](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T "AT&T Inc.")) - to register for free access until July.

"During beta, you can send and receive satellite-powered text messages, with data and voice capabilities to follow," T-Mobile (NASDAQ:[TMUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS "T-Mobile US, Inc.")) announced.

T-Mobile Starlink uses satellites with direct-to-cell capabilities orbiting the Earth to deliver cell phone signals. " When a userâ€™s cell phone gets out of range of a cell tower, the phone automatically connects to the T-Mobile Starlink network. No need to manually connect," the company stated.

After the service's launch in July, T-Mobile Starlink will be included at no extra cost on Go5G Next and Go5G Business Next. T-Mobile ([TMUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS "T-Mobile US, Inc.")) customers on any other plan can add the service for $15/month per line. The service will be available to Verizon ([VZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ "Verizon Communications Inc.")) and AT&T ([T](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T "AT&T Inc.")) customers for $20/month per line.

Customers who sign up for the beta trial will be eligible for a 33% discount once the service launches, which will apply through February.

"Users will be enrolled on an ongoing basis to help test the system and provide feedback before launching in July," T-Mobile ([TMUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS "T-Mobile US, Inc.")) added.
