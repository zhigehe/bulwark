When it comes to AI stocks, many investors have been focusing on mega-cap names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) or Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")).

But what about smaller companies? **Which small/mid-cap stocks should investors be watching in the AI space?**

We asked Seeking Alpha analysts [**Tech Stock Pros**,](https://seekingalpha.com/author/tech-stock-pros) [**Brett Ashcroft Green**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/brett-ashcroft-green) and **[Michael Wiggins De Oliveira](https://seekingalpha.com/author/michael-wiggins-de-oliveira)** for their picks.

[**Tech Stock Pros:**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/tech-stock-pros) AI is in an awkward position after the market woke up to DeepSeek, i.e., the ability to make AI models with lower computing power without compromising performance. There's still a lot of confusion about the impact it'll have, which puts the AI names under heavy investor scrutiny, but there are still windows for profit.

Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:[MPWR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPWR "Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.")) is one such window, largely considered a smaller-cap name relative to semis. This is a once-high-traction AI name that fell out of grace in 2H24 after losing socket share with Nvidia's (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) GB200 and getting downgraded by Edgewater Research.

We like this name because we think they're well positioned to outperform expectations into 2026 on the higher power requirement needs across the end markets in which it operates: enterprise data (content at Nvidia), automotive, computing and storage, communications, consumer and even industrial.

Another name that comes to mind is Astera Labs (NASDAQ:[ALAB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALAB "Astera Labs, Inc.")), which operates in connectivity. As the barrier for AI endpoint is lowered, we're looking at a higher need for connectivity down the line.

Having said this, getting into either of these at the right stock price is crucial to play on these longer-term catalysts.

**[Brett Ashcroft Green:](https://seekingalpha.com/author/brett-ashcroft-green)** For small-cap AI-related stocks, Airship AI (ASIP) has an intriguing deck and an easy-to-understand model of what they are trying to achieve. The company develops video analytic software for object and facial recognition.

I like that itâ€™s almost purely software-related and national security-focused during a runway where more will be spent on improving U.S. national security as well as border surveillance. The tech can be applied to almost anything with a camera attached. With the R&D team in Taiwan, I get the inkling they can absorb important tech from Mainland China, where this type of technology is most advanced. 

PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation (NASDAQ:[PRCT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRCT "PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation")) is a good mid-cap in the med-tech space. With a market cap under $4B, they focus on Aquablation therapy and have a Swiss Army knife prostate-focused surgical platform. Biotech and med-tech should be great AI-adjacent beneficiaries that large and mega-cap healthcare R&D departments are hunting for. They already generate about $200M in revenue and are growing.

[**Michael Wiggins De Oliveira:**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/michael-wiggins-de-oliveira) I believe that investors should back stocks that are ready to inflect higher on a new narrative. A narrative where they can point towards deploying AI to increase their customers' productivity.

The setup that I recommend is super easy to follow and highly profitable. I like to recommend businesses that are moving from negative to positive free cash flow positive.

Case in point, since Asana's (NYSE:[ASAN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN "Asana, Inc.")) free cash flow margin runs ahead of its non-GAAP profit margins by approximately 200 basis points, I believe that starting in February 2025, Asana (NYSE:[ASAN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN "Asana, Inc.")) will be on a path to deliver about 5% free cash flow margins.

In practical terms, I'll always remind investors that they should never think about what the company is doing now. What matters is looking ahead 12 months to where the company will be.

Today, Asana (NYSE:[ASAN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASAN "Asana, Inc.")) is viewed in a negative light, as yet another Covid-bubble unprofitable business. But what if, in the coming twelve months, there's some growth left in the business? That, together with its strong balance sheet, and now free cash flow positive? Add to that some new AI narrative, and the bull case writes itself as the stock is propelled higher.
