The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index"))([VOO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO "Vanguard S&P 500 ETF"))([SPY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY "SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust")) has been sturdy in 2025 in the face of two “negative shocks,” including U.S. President Donald Trump’s order of tariffs on key trading partners, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said this week. 

The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) has risen 2.5% this year, following gains of more than 20% last year and in 2023. For 2025, “so far, I would say that the news that we've seen on tariffs - they've had more bark than bite, meaning they've proven to be opportunities for investors to buy,” [Lee told CNBC’s “Closing Bell”](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/07/tariffs-have-had-more-bark-than-bite-says-fundstrats-tom-lee.html "Lee told CNBC’s “Closing Bell”") on Friday. 

Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed by a month or more this week. China, meanwhile, has imposed retaliatory tariffs against a 25% levy on Chinese products, paid for by U.S. importers. Stocks ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index"))([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index"))([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) [fell Friday](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405171-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market "fell Friday"), in part after Trump said he will announce [reciprocal tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405350-trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-are-coming-so-what-are-they "reciprocal tariffs") next week.

Although hit with a late-January selloff, the S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) ended the month up by 2.7%. “This is a sign of resilience as dips are being bought,” Lee said in a Friday [post on X](https://x.com/fundstrat/status/1887978797712162830 "post on X") (formerly Twitter).

The selloff stemmed from the other market "shock": the swelling popularity of [China’s DeepSeek](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398699-chinese-ai-lab-deepseek-rattles-silicon-valley "China’s DeepSeek") R1 chatbot app, which came with concerns about the startup's relatively low-cost AI technology.

For markets, a "good sanity check" will come in the form of next week's January consumer inflation report, Lee wrote.

Lee said "big news" this week was [ISM manufacturing activity rising above 50](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401935-u_s_-ism-manufacturing-pmi-signals-expansion-in-january "ISM manufacturing activity rising above 50") in January. The reading marked the first indication of expansion after 26 straight months of contraction, the Institute for Supply Management said. 

“That really does point to earnings dispersion improving,” Lee told CNBC. “So I like industrials, the financials,” he said. He also expects the lagging area of small-cap stocks ([RTY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY "Russell 2000 Index")) to eventually perform well.

During the tariff delays, Mexico and the U.S. will discuss reducing border crossings of drugs and migrants into the U.S., and high-powered weapons into Mexico. Canada said it’s enhancing its [previously announced C$1.3B border security plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2024/12/government-of-canada-announces-its-plan-to-strengthen-border-security-and-our-immigration-system.html) and that talks are ongoing.
