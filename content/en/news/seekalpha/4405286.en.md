Centrus Energy (NYSE:[LEU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LEU)) +33.2% in Friday's trading after easily beating [Q4 adjusted earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404844-centrus-energy-non-gaap-eps-of-3_20-beats-by-1_56-revenue-of-151_6m-beats-by-44_93m) and revenue expectations, pointing to a rising backlog, the success of its HALEU production, and the restart of centrifuge manufacturing activities.

Q4 net profit fell slightly to $53.7M, or $3.20/share, from $56.3M, or $3.58/share, in the year-earlier quarter, but both were far above analyst consensus estimates, and revenues surged 46% Y/Y to $151.6M; the company's backlog totaled $3.7B as of December 31 and extends to 2040.

Centrus (NYSE:[LEU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LEU "Centrus Energy Corp.")) said during the quarter it secured new government contracts, made contingent sales of $2B in contracts and commitments, and obtained private financing that will help underpin a potential expansion of its enrichment plant in Ohio.

The company said it strengthened its balance sheet with the closing of $402.5M in convertible senior notes, leading to an unrestricted cash balance of $671.4M as of year-end 2024.

The surge in Centrus ([LEU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LEU "Centrus Energy Corp.")) shares appears to be helping some other small modular reactor names, including Oklo ([OKLO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKLO "Oklo Inc.")) +16.1%, Nuscale Power ([SMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMR "NuScale Power Corporation")) +8.3%, Nano Nuclear Energy ([NNE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNE "NANO Nuclear Energy Inc.")) +3.9%.
