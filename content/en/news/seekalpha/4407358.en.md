Earnings Call Insights: First Capital Real Estate Investment Trust ([OTC:FCXXF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCXXF "First Capital Real Estate Investment Trust")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Adam Paul highlighted the successful execution of the first year of the company’s three-year strategic plan, including a $320M divestiture program in 2024, which aligned with the $1B divestiture goal over the three-year period. He emphasized that these efforts aim to reduce exposure to low-yielding and non-income-producing assets.
* The company achieved a 14.9% year-over-year OFFO growth, adjusted to 5.4% after excluding nonrecurring items. Same-property NOI increased by $17.7M or 4.4% due to leasing activity.
* Debt-to-EBITDA improved to 8.7 times by year-end, exceeding the target of low 9x for 2024. The company remains on track for its goal of low 8x by the end of 2026.
* CFO Neil Downey reported Q4 operating FFO of $68M, equating to $0.32 per unit, consistent with Q4 2023. He also noted strong same-property NOI growth of 3.4% year-over-year in Q4, driven by higher rents and improved recoveries.

### Outlook

* Management forecasts same-property NOI growth of approximately 4% in 2025, supported by contracted rent escalations and stabilized leasing activity. This excludes lease termination fees and bad debt expenses.
* Development expenditures for 2025 are expected to range between $130M and $160M, focusing on projects like Humbertown Shopping Center, 1071 King Street West, and Yonge & Roselawn.
* The company expects portfolio operational CapEx to remain consistent with 2024 levels at $73M, alongside normal inflationary growth in G&A expenses.

### Financial Results

* Q4 total NOI reached $115M, a $5M year-over-year increase, with same-property NOI contributing $105.5M, reflecting a 3.4% growth. Key drivers included higher base rents and recoveries.
* Full-year 2024 OFFO was $291M or $1.36 per unit. Adjusted for nonrecurring items, normalized FFO stood at $270M or $1.26 per unit, marking a new record since 2019.
* Dispositions in 2024 totaled $320M, with asset sales achieving an average premium to IFRS NAV of over 50%.
* Occupancy improved by 60 basis points year-over-year to 96.8%, nearing the all-time high of 96.9% set in 2019.

### Q&A

* Dean Wilkinson, CIBC, asked about the impact of leverage targets on asset divestitures and development activities. CFO Neil Downey reiterated the company’s goals to achieve low 8x debt-to-EBITDA by 2026, while CEO Adam Paul emphasized the potential for redeploying proceeds into core grocery-anchored centers and development post-2026.
* Lorne Kalmar, Desjardins, inquired about the macroeconomic impact on the pace of dispositions. COO Jordie Robins noted that while the market remains challenging, the company is still progressing with its $1B divestiture objective.

* Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management showed consistent confidence, with discussions shifting more toward future growth opportunities and less on immediate operational risks.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Both quarters highlighted the importance of the three-year plan, with Q4 showing stronger execution on divestitures and leasing metrics.
* Q4’s adjusted OFFO growth of 5.4% marked a deceleration from Q3’s 7%, attributed to the timing of growth-related factors.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged macroeconomic uncertainty as a potential headwind for dispositions but emphasized the quality of assets and disciplined pricing strategies.
* Analyst concerns included tenant watchlists and the impact of slowing population growth on retail demand. Management noted no material changes in tenant behavior or lease negotiations.
* The company’s reliance on achieving disposition targets and executing development projects poses potential risks, especially under challenging market conditions.
