Earnings Call Insights: Intercorp Financial Services Inc. (NYSE:[IFS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IFS "Intercorp Financial Services Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Luis Felipe Castellanos highlighted the recovery in Peru’s macroeconomic environment, with GDP growth in Q4 reaching 3.7% and expectations for 2.8% growth in 2025. He emphasized that IFS achieved an ROE of over 18% in Q4, driven by improved cost of risk and strong performances in insurance and wealth management segments. He also noted Interbank's increased market share in loans and deposits, solidifying its position as the third-largest bank in these categories.
* CFO Michela Casassa reported that IFS's net income grew by 71% year-over-year in Q4, totaling S/ 496 million and resulting in an 18.2% ROE. She attributed this to lower cost of risk, reduced funding costs, and improved investment portfolio performance. She also highlighted double-digit growth in individual life insurance, annuities, and wealth management assets under management.

### Outlook

* Management provided 2025 guidance, targeting an ROE of 16% for the year, driven by high single-digit loan growth, particularly in commercial banking and a recovering consumer loan portfolio. Margins are expected to recover, with projected NIM above 5.4%, supported by improved funding costs and loan yield recovery.
* Cost of risk is anticipated to remain around 3%, reflecting a stable risk environment.
* Digital adoption continues to be a priority, with over 80% of retail and 70% of commercial customers already classified as digital.

### Financial Results

* IFS reported a net income of S/ 496 million for Q4, up 71% year-over-year and 26% sequentially, with an ROE of 18.2%, aligning with mid-term targets.
* Interbank’s cost of risk decreased to 2.6%, down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting improved consumer payment behavior and liquidity events.
* The share of low-cost deposits increased by 16% year-over-year, contributing to a 100 basis-point decrease in funding costs.
* Wealth management assets under management reached a historic high of $7.3 billion, growing 17% year-over-year, while fee income surged by 28%.
* Insurance operations saw double-digit growth in individual life and annuities, maintaining leadership with a market share of over 30% in annuities.

### Q&A

* Ernesto Gabilondo, Bank of America: Asked about fee income growth and its digital contribution. CFO Casassa indicated fee income is expected to grow in the high single to low double digits, supported by Izipay, Inteligo, and consumer portfolio recovery. She noted most fees are now digital due to high digital adoption rates among customers.
* Yuri Fernandes, JPMorgan: Questioned the 16% ROE guidance given Q4's strong performance. CEO Castellanos explained that Q4 ROE benefited from seasonal factors and Inteligo’s investment portfolio, with management being cautious about 2025 due to potential pre-electoral year volatility.
* Nicolas Riva, Bank of America: Inquired about plans for calling the 2030 Tier 2 bonds. CEO Castellanos confirmed the call will be executed, funded by the recent bond issuance.

* Compared to Q3, management demonstrated increased confidence in the recovery trajectory but maintained a prudently conservative outlook for the coming year.

* Loan growth accelerated, with a 17% year-over-year increase in commercial loans and a slight recovery in consumer loans, compared to moderate growth in Q3.
