Earnings Call Insights: Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:[LSCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSCC "Lattice Semiconductor Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ford Tamer highlighted the successful launch of the Nexus 2 platform and two new Avant devices, strengthening the company's position in the small-to-mid range FPGA market. He noted "record design wins in 2024" and emphasized double-digit revenue growth from new products.
* Tamer announced the inauguration of a new R&D site in Pune, India, and emphasized its significance in advancing AI and software development capabilities. He also outlined the expanded leadership team with new hires, including Lorenzo Flores as CFO and Nicole Singer as Chief People Officer, along with internal promotions.
* CFO Lorenzo Flores stated, "Revenue for the full year 2024 was $509.4 million," while emphasizing disciplined operating expense management and workforce realignment efforts to support long-term financial growth.

### Outlook

* Revenue for Q1 2025 is projected to be between $115 million and $125 million, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 69% Â± 1%.
* Non-GAAP EPS for Q1 2025 is expected in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share.
* CEO Tamer reiterated the expectation for a "U-shaped recovery" through 2025, with low single-digit revenue growth for the year. Long-term revenue growth of 15%-20% is anticipated by 2026, driven by new product launches and inventory normalization.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue totaled $117.4 million, in line with guidance but reflecting an 8% sequential decrease and a 31% year-over-year decline due to inventory normalization and macroeconomic headwinds.
* Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by a $7 million one-time charge, reducing it to 62.1%. Without the charge, the gross margin would have been 68.1%.
* Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 2024 was $0.15, but excluding the one-time charge, it would have been $0.20 per share. Free cash flow margin improved to 34% in the quarter, supported by increased operational cash flow.
* Full-year 2024 revenue was $509.4 million, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 67.4% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.8%. Revenue from new products, including Nexus and Avant, grew double digits compared to 2023.

### Q&A

* Melissa Weathers, Deutsche Bank: "Any particular end-markets performing better than others?" CEO Tamer highlighted improvements in industrial, automotive, and communications sectors, while computing remained strong. He added, "Channel inventory is expected to normalize by mid-2025."
* Ruben Roy, Stifel: "What drives your 15%-20% growth target by 2026?" Tamer attributed it to new products like Avant and Nexus, which now make up mid-teens of total revenue, as well as expanding design wins and adoption in AI and automotive markets.
* Srini Pajjuri, Raymond James: "How do you view post-quantum cryptography potential?" Tamer stated, "We are the only FPGA provider with a solution today," citing adoption by major Tier-1 OEMs and partnerships in security applications.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on inventory normalization timelines and the competitive positioning of new products. Concerns were raised about short-term revenue softness in industrial and automotive segments.
* Management maintained a positive tone, emphasizing long-term growth potential, new product momentum, and operational discipline. CEO Tamer's confidence was evident in phrases like "we are very optimistic" and "we are confident in achieving our targets."

* Management's tone remained consistent, emphasizing the U-shaped recovery and long-term growth potential. Analysts continued to focus on inventory dynamics and market recovery timelines.
* Strategic priorities shifted slightly, with increased emphasis on post-quantum cryptography and AI-driven applications.
