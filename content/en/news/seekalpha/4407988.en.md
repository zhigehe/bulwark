### Management View

* CEO Alan Trefler highlighted the strong results achieved in 2024 and expressed excitement about the momentum heading into 2025. He emphasized the transformative impact of Pega GenAI Blueprint, describing it as central to client interactions and a major driver of engagement and innovation. Trefler noted the addition of capabilities for legacy transformation and cloud integration, including importing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and APIs to modernize workflows.
* Trefler mentioned the launch of Pega AgentX, an offering designed to make workflows "agentic" by integrating AI agents into established procedures. He stated, "Pega AgentX enables our clients to leverage the power of their workflows to deliver the agents they need to better serve customers and operate efficiently."
* CFO Kenneth Stillwell confirmed that Pegasystems achieved Rule of 40 status in 2024, driven by a balance of ACV growth and free cash flow margin. He reported that annual contract value ([ACV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACV "Virtus AllianzGI Diversified Income & Convertible Fund")) grew 11% year-over-year in constant currency, with Pega Cloud ACV increasing 21%. Stillwell also highlighted a 59% year-over-year increase in cash flow from operations, reaching $346 million.

### Outlook

* Management provided guidance for 2025, targeting 12% ACV growth year-over-year. Stillwell clarified that this guidance does not include significant contributions from Pega GenAI Blueprint adoption, which could provide upside potential.
* The company plans to increase investments in sales and marketing in 2025 to support new logo acquisition while maintaining efficiency. Stillwell noted that Pega Cloud ACV is expected to remain the primary driver of growth.
* Stillwell stated, "Our philosophy is that free cash flow per share should grow faster than ACV growth."

### Financial Results

* ACV increased 11% year-over-year in constant currency, with Pega Cloud ACV growing 21%. The company attributed this growth to its GenAI Blueprint and targeted account sales strategy.
* Free cash flow grew 68% year-over-year to $338 million. Stillwell highlighted improvements in Pega Cloud gross margin, which rose from 75% in 2023 to 78% in 2024.
