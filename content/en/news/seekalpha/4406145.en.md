Frontera Energy ([OTCPK:FECCF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FECCF "Frontera Energy Corporation")) and partner CGX Energy ([OTCPK:CGXEF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGXEF "CGX Energy Inc.")) said Tuesday the Guyana government [terminated their exploration license](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/guyana-issues-30-day-notice-cancel-frontera-cgx-energys-corentyne-license-2025-02-11/ "terminated their exploration license") for the Corentyne block.

While the companies did not disclose the reason for the cancellation, the government previously had expressed a lack of confidence in the joint venture's ability to find a financial partner for the project.

The JV said it believes its license for the Corentyne block remains in place and it is assessing all legal options available to assert its rights and will respond to the government.

The Corentyne field is the only area Frontera ([OTCPK:FECCF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FECCF "Frontera Energy Corporation")) and CGX ([OTCPK:CGXEF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGXEF "CGX Energy Inc.")) have left in Guyana after the companies returned two other blocks earlier.

In June, the companies said they submitted a notice of potential commercial interest to Guyana's government for the Wei-1 discovery to preserve their interests in the license.

The JV drilled the Wei-1 well in 2023, its second well on the Corentyne block; at the time, the JV said the well fulfilled an obligation under the second phase of a second renewal of the original 10-year license, and that it also served as an appraisal well for a program with the government.
