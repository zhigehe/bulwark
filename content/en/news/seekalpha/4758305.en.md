Gold bulls have enjoyed a remarkable run in the precious metal. A troy ounce is up 44% from a year ago, and shares of gold-mining companies are up considerably more. The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (NASDAQ:[RING](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING "iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF")) has returned more than 65% in the past year, smashing the relatively paltry 18% gain in the iShares All-Country World Index ETF ([ACWI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACWI "iShares MSCI ACWI ETF")).

I was bullish on RING last August as it knocked on the door of key resistance. The fund rallied above $33-$34, an important spot, before coming back down to earth by late in the fourth quarter. RING has returned 8% since my [August 2024 analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717304-ring-gold-miners-outpacing-gold-still-a-low-valuation), about in line with the S&P 500’s gain, and I reiterate a buy rating now that it has once again climbed above resistance. I will also provide a refresher on the valuation, which has turned even more compelling now that gold prices are above $2900 per ounce, an all-time high.

RING Beating Gold and the ACWI YoY

According to the [issuer](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239654/ishares-msci-global-gold-miners-etf), RING seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global equities of companies primarily engaged in the business of gold mining. The ETF offers investors exposure to companies that derive the majority of their revenues from gold mining and gives targeted access to global gold mining stocks. RING can be used to diversify a portfolio and to express a global sector view.

Now ranked No. 2 out of 429 in its asset class, RING has grown markedly since my Q3 2024 analysis. Assets under management is now $1.1 billion, nearly double the level from last summer. The fund sports a moderate [annual expense ratio](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING/expenses#source=first_level_url%3Asymbol%7Csection_asset%3AETFGrades%7Cbutton%3Aexpenses_category) of 39 basis points, while the forward [dividend yield](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING/dividends/scorecard#source=first_level_url%3Asymbol%7Csection_asset%3AETFGrades%7Cbutton%3Adividends_category) has dropped to 1.14% as of February 12, 2025. 

[Share-price momentum](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING/momentum/performance#source=first_level_url%3Asymbol%7Csection_asset%3AETFGrades%7Cbutton%3Aperformance_category) is stellar today, earning RING a perfect A+ grade in that category from Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. Prospective investors probably understand that gold miners are some of the most volatile equities in the global market, so the [Risk rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING/risk#source=first_level_url%3Asymbol%7Csection_asset%3AETFGrades%7Cbutton%3Arisk_category) is weak. Finally, there are [liquidity issues](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING/liquidity#source=first_level_url%3Asymbol%7Csection_asset%3AETFGrades%7Cbutton%3Aasset_flows_category) with RING considering that average daily volume is less than 300,000 shares and its 30-day median bid/ask spread is wide at 17 basis points, per iShares. So, using limit orders, particularly around the market open is prudent.

For a portfolio update, the 4-star-rated ETF by Morningstar has mixed exposure across the style box. One-quarter of the allocation is housed in large-cap growth, and there is a more than 40% weight to global SMID caps. Investors should also notice that 80% of RING is invested in non-US stocks, so that adds an extra degree of currency risk and global macro variability. 

What’s particularly appealing today is the fund’s valuation. With high gold prices, earnings estimates have been on the rise for its holdings, resulting in a low 10.9 price-to-earnings ratio. The long-term EPS growth rate is north of 30%, a jump from what I found last year; the resulting PEG ratio is very low, near 0.3x.

RING: Portfolio & Factor Profiles

So far, the numbers look very impressive for RING, but risk is seen in the top 10 holdings which account for a high 74% of the fund. I have [covered](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717228-newmont-stock-raising-price-target-gold-hits-record-highs) names such as Newmont Corp ([NEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM "Newmont Corporation")), Agnico Eagle Mines ([AEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEM "Agnico Eagle Mines Limited")), and Barrick Gold Corp ([GOLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD "Barrick Gold Corporation")) previously, and I am generally bullish on the group. Still, paying close attention to both the fundamentals and technicals among the top three positions is key. 

Going forward, I would like to see gold miners pay out more shareholders via dividends since cash flow should be robust given where gold prices are and as wage cost increases have eased. Of course, interest expense remains elevated for many of RING’s holdings which do hold material debt amounts.

Seasonally, RING has performed very well so far in what’s usually a lackluster month. The ETF has historically shined in March and April, so if the past is any kind of prologue, more gains could be on tap. May through June has been a weak stretch, however.

The Technical Take
------------------

With shares undervalued as gold approaches the $3000 mark, I see technical strength in RING. Notice in the chart below that the fund is back above the $33-$34 mark that I highlighted in the middle of last year. A bearish false breakout occurred this past October, leading to a swift 25% correction. The fund held the highs from late 2023 despite falling below its long-term 200-day moving average as 2024 came to a close.

Today, momentum is very strong, in fact, it may be stretched. Take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph – it's above 70, suggesting that some consolidation within a longer-term uptrend is possible. With price above both the 50dma and 200dma, though, the bulls control the primary trend. Finally, there’s a high amount of volume by price from $33-$34 down to the mid-$20s which should offer a cushion if we see a protracted pullback.

The Bottom Line
---------------

I have a buy rating on RING. I see the global gold mining fund as attractive on valuation, with bullish seasonality in play soon. Technicals are solid and relative strength is very high so far in 2025.
