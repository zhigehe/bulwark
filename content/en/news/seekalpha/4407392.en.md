Earnings Call Insights: Aethlon Medical (NASDAQ:[AEMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEMD "Aethlon Medical, Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Jim Frakes noted that Aethlon Medical has made significant progress in focusing on oncology and implementing cost reductions. Operating expenses were reduced by 50% compared to the same quarter last year, enabling resources to be directed toward critical oncology trials in Australia and India.
* Chief Medical Officer Steven LaRosa reported that three patients have been enrolled in the Australian oncology trial for the Hemopurifier. One patient completed the treatment phase, showing no adverse events or device-related issues. Protocol amendments have been introduced to accelerate enrollment, including the removal of a two-month run-in period and broader eligibility criteria.
* CFO Jim Frakes highlighted financial improvements, stating that the company’s cost-cutting measures have optimized resource allocation for ongoing clinical programs while maintaining a cash balance of $4.8 million at the end of the quarter.

### Outlook

* The company expects protocol amendments in the Australian trial to increase enrollment rates and reduce delays. Approval for similar changes in the Indian trial is being pursued.
* The first cohort of the Australian trial is expected to provide safety data after all three patients complete their treatments and follow-up assessments. Subsequent cohorts will explore increased Hemopurifier treatment frequencies.
* Management anticipates that the updated protocol will shorten time-to-treatment and improve data collection efficiency in both regions.

### Financial Results

* Operating expenses for the quarter decreased to $1.8 million from $3.6 million in the prior year, driven by reductions in payroll, professional fees, and administrative costs.
* Clinical trial expenses increased by $200,000 due to advancing trials in Australia, with the company expecting a 43% tax rebate for qualifying expenses.
* Net loss for the quarter was $1.8 million, a marked improvement from $3.5 million in the prior year.

### Q&A

* Marla Marin, Zacks: Asked about the impact of patients not advancing to treatment in the Australian trial. Steven LaRosa clarified that nine to 18 Hemopurifier-treated patients are required, and valuable data is still collected during the run-in period. Jim Frakes noted that the updated protocol eliminates the two-month run-in period, simplifying the enrollment process.
* Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group: Inquired about expected enrollment pace following the activation of the third Australian site. Steven LaRosa expressed confidence in accelerated enrollment given the large patient pool and experienced team at the Sydney site.
* Anthony Vendetti: Asked about the potential use of the Hemopurifier for bird flu treatment. Jim Frakes explained that while the device has not been used for bird flu in humans, it could be considered if current treatments prove ineffective.
* Anthony Vendetti: Questioned whether the $1.8 million quarterly expense level is sustainable. Jim Frakes indicated that expenses may increase as trials progress and staffing needs grow.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised questions about trial enrollment progress and cost sustainability, reflecting cautious optimism. Concerns centered on patient recruitment timelines and operational efficiency.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing progress in clinical trials and cost management. Responses in the Q&A were measured, particularly regarding future expense projections.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Operating expenses decreased significantly from $2.9 million in Q2 to $1.8 million in Q3, reflecting aggressive cost-cutting measures.
* Management’s tone in the current quarter was more focused on specific trial milestones, compared to broader strategic discussions in the previous quarter.
* Analysts’ questions evolved from initial trial setup concerns to more detailed inquiries about enrollment progress and protocol efficiency.
* Protocol updates in the Australian trial marked a shift in strategic focus, aiming to accelerate patient recruitment and improve data timelines.

### Risks and Concerns

* Enrollment challenges remain a key risk, despite protocol amendments designed to streamline the process.
* Regulatory delays in India could impact the timeline for initiating trials in that region.
* Analysts highlighted the potential for increased operating expenses as trials advance, which could strain financial resources.

### Final Takeaway

Aethlon Medical has demonstrated meaningful progress in its oncology trials, supported by protocol updates aimed at accelerating patient enrollment and reducing delays.
