Google (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and SoftBank ([OTCPK:SFTBY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY "SoftBank Group Corp.")) are among the investors in quantum computing startup QuEra Computing, Bloomberg reported.

Google and SoftBank's Vision Fund participated in a round that saw QuEra Computing raise $230M “in a matter of weeks,” QuEra CEO Andy Ory told the [news outlet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/google-softbank-back-quantum-startup-quera-in-230-million-deal "news outlet").

The company solved a series of technical challenges, which spurred the investors approaching QuEra for the new funding. Of the $230M, $60M has yet to be paid out as it will have to hit certain technical milestones, Bloomberg added. The company intends to use the additional funding to increase the size of its staff to around 130 employees.

Prior to the new capital raise, QuEra was valued between $750M and $1B, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the conversations.

QuEra was spun off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018 and already brings in "tens of millions" in revenue from several customers, including Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Bloomberg added.

Quantum computing has become a hot topic on Wall Street, thanks in part to recent advancements made by Google.

Late last year, the tech giant [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4384004-quantum-stocks-edge-higher-on-googles-willow-chip "announced") its Willow quantum chip that many saw as a technological breakthrough. Since then, quantum computing-related stocks, including IonQ ([IONQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IONQ "IonQ, Inc.")), D-Wave Quantum ([QBTS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QBTS "D-Wave Quantum Inc.")), Quantum Computing ([QUBT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QUBT "Quantum Computing Inc.")), Rigetti Computing ([RGT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGT "Royce Global Value Trust")) and others have [soared](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397034-quantum-stocks-keep-shining-as-honeywells-quantinuum-announces-new-rd-center "soared") in value amid renewed investor interest in the space.
