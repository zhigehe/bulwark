Goldman Sachs initiated Silence Therapeutics (NASDAQ:[SLN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLN "Silence Therapeutics plc")) with a Sell rating and a $6 price target on Tuesday, arguing that with only about $173M of cash and equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, the U.K.-based biotech will struggle to complete a key Phase 3 trial.

Goldman analyst Richard Law argued that Silence (NASDAQ:[SLN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLN "Silence Therapeutics plc")) can only start but cannot complete its $300M cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) for its lead asset, zerlasiran, and it will have to find a major pharma partner to help develop and commercialize the therapy.

Additionally, the analyst argued that zerlasiran targeted at atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with high lipoprotein (a) “looks undifferentiated” from competing candidates, and the company’s development timeline for the treatment is “multiple years behind” those of its rivals.

“Given SLN’s constrained financial resources and the need to seek capital, we foresee a risk for delays in initiating the Ph. 3 CVOT that could set zerlasiran further behind its major competitors,” Law wrote.
