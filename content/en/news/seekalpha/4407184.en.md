After a 10-year run, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:[MNST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNST "Monster Beverage Corporation")) will continue to be the official energy drink of the UFC ([TKO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TKO "TKO Group Holdings, Inc.")), making this partnership the longest sponsorship deal in the history of both companies.

Through a multi-year deal with the UFC, the Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:[MNST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNST "Monster Beverage Corporation")) logo will continue to enjoy prominent placement at all UFC events, as well as at the center of the famous UFC Octagon. Monster Beverage will also feature prominently among athletes at all Monster-sponsored UFC events and post-event press conferences.

“The Monster logo has been a fixture in the Octagon for a decade—literally right in the middle of our biggest events. When you think of UFC, you think of Monster,” said UFC president and CEO Dana White.

Added Monster co-CEO Rodney Sacks, “This historic renewal marks the biggest sponsorship deal in our history and the largest in UFC history.”

Shares of TKO Group Holdings ([TKO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TKO "TKO Group Holdings, Inc.")) the parent company of UFC, closed higher for an eighth consecutive while Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:[MNST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNST "Monster Beverage Corporation")) shares are in the green for a fifth consecutive day.
