* Notable customer wins included one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, the University of San Diego, and a major seven-figure ARR deal—one of the largest in Procore's history. An Australian contractor expanded its Procore adoption by nearly 10x, highlighting the platform's ability to integrate with ERP systems.
