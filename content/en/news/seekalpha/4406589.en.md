### Management View

* CEO George Colony emphasized the completion of Forrester's multi-year transition to the Forrester Decisions (FD) platform, with 80% of contract value (CV) now on the FD portfolio. He noted that the company is now fully focused on selling and supporting FD, which is expected to drive long-term shareholder and client value.
* Colony stated, "Retention improved by 2 points, and contract value per client increased 10% from $143,000 at year-end 2023 to $158,000 at year-end 2024." The percentage of multi-year contracts also grew from 62% to 69%.
* He highlighted the launch of new tools and services, including the generative AI tool Izola, which saw increased functionality and usage, and the launch of Forrester Decisions for data, AI, and analytics to address high-growth areas like financial services and high-tech.
* CFO Chris Finn reported that Q4 revenue was $108 million, a 9% decline year-over-year, while full-year revenue declined 10% to $432.5 million. Operating income increased 32% to $8.9 million for the quarter due to cost controls, including a workforce reduction of approximately 6%.
* Finn added, "Net income and earnings per share increased 42% and 44%, respectively, compared to Q4 of last year."

### Outlook

* Management anticipates flat contract value growth in 2025, citing factors such as continued tech market weakness, economic uncertainties, and adjustments to the company's sales culture and processes.
* Revenue is projected at $400 million to $415 million for 2025, representing a decline of 4% to 8%. EPS guidance for the year is between $1.20 and $1.35.
* Colony outlined three priorities for 2025: improving retention, driving growth through targeted sales strategies, and enhancing events to boost retention and CV growth. Specific investments in events include shifting marketing dollars, incentivizing client participation, and expanding event experiences.

### Financial Results

* Forrester reported Q4 revenue of $108 million vs. analysts' estimate of $106.25 million. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was $0.36 vs. analysts' estimate of $0.34.
* Full-year revenue was $432.5 million, a decline from $480.8 million in 2023. Operating income for the year decreased 26% to $38.5 million, while net income fell 23% to $28.1 million.
* Research revenues decreased 7% in Q4, while consulting revenue declined 8%. The events segment saw a 42% decline in Q4 revenue to $2.7 million.
* The company ended the year with $104.7 million in cash and investments and repurchased $16 million worth of shares during 2024.

### Q&A

* Andrew Nicholas, William Blair, asked about Q4 bookings challenges and their impact on industries. Chief Sales Officer Nate Swan explained that smaller tech vendors and government agencies faced budgetary constraints, while execution challenges in India also contributed to weaker results.
* Nicholas followed up on 2025 CV growth expectations and macroeconomic visibility. Colony noted that the company has reduced its exposure to smaller tech vendors and expects stabilization in 2025, driven by improved execution and pipeline development.
* Anja Soderstrom, Sidoti, inquired about challenges in India and the transition to larger customers. Swan emphasized ongoing efforts to improve sales motions and retention lifecycle processes, which have shown success in early renewals.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed concerns over Q4 execution challenges and the impact of smaller tech vendor performance, reflecting a slightly negative tone. Questions focused on the company's ability to penetrate senior-level clients and drive CV growth in a challenging macro environment.
* Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing progress in retention and CV metrics while acknowledging areas needing improvement. Colony's forward-looking statements demonstrated confidence: "We are focused on executing, making this distinct model work."
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone during prepared remarks remained consistent, but the Q&A section saw analysts pressing more on execution and guidance concerns.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Management's tone was consistent across quarters in outlining progress on the FD migration, but Q4 saw a sharper focus on execution challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties.
* Revenue guidance for 2025 reflected a more conservative outlook compared to Q3, driven by late-quarter bookings issues and economic headwinds.
* Analyst questions in Q4 centered more on specific areas of weakness, such as small tech vendors and geographic challenges, compared to broader macro concerns in Q3.
* The company remained optimistic about the long-term potential of Izola and the FD platform, reiterating key strategic priorities for 2025.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management cited macroeconomic uncertainties, including political changes in the U.S. and continued weakness in the tech market, as potential risks to 2025 performance.
* The transition to selling FD and targeting larger clients remains a challenge, with execution and retention improvements critical to achieving growth targets.
* Analyst concerns included the ability to stabilize events and consulting revenues and the impact of downsizing smaller tech vendor relationships.

### Final Takeaway

Forrester Research enters 2025 focused on stabilizing its financial performance and driving long-term growth through retention, targeted sales strategies, and enhanced client offerings. While macroeconomic challenges and execution issues remain, the companyâ€™s shift to the Forrester Decisions platform, combined with investments in AI-based tools and events, positions it to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the tech market.
