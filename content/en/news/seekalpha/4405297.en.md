Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF "Airbus SE")) ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")) said Friday it has [delayed plans](https://www.ft.com/content/12490140-dd6d-4191-9495-a0dadb68874c "delayed plans") to fly a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035, citing slower than expected advances in technology, in a setback for the aviation industry’s hopes to achieve net zero.

The airplane manufacturer had told the *Financial Times* [earlier this week](https://www.ft.com/content/54934cb4-4fdc-43af-bc68-5ea12f78bf27 "earlier this week") that “2035 remains the ambition” for the aircraft after European airlines scaled back their ambitions for hydrogen’s role in reaching net zero by 2050.

Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF "Airbus SE")) ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")) did not provide a new timeline for the project, but the Force Ouvriere union said staff had been told that the technology was running 5-10 years behind the pace needed to support the original 2035 target.

The union also said Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF "Airbus SE")) ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")) had indicated it would cut the budget dedicated to its hydrogen initiatives by 25% and planned to shut down plans to test hydrogen fuel cell engines on a modified A380 superjumbo, *FT* reported.

The company said it remained "committed to [its] goal of bringing a commercially viable, hydrogen-powered aircraft to market," but recent developments "indicate that progress on key enablers, particularly the availability of hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources at scale, is slower than anticipated."

Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF "Airbus SE")) ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")) has been more bullish than rival Boeing about the potential for hydrogen to help decarbonize emissions from flying, and engineers at the company have been working for years on several different zero-emission concepts, all of which rely on hydrogen as their primary power source.
