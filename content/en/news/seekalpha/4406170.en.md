As President Trump continues to implement new tariffs, U.S. markets could face heightened volatility as investors adjust to the shifting dynamics of the global economy.

Vanguard, one of the world’s leading asset managers, suggests that looking to history for context could provide valuable insights. For long-term investors, this means preparing for potential market fluctuations as they navigate the evolving narrative surrounding the future of international trade.

While much of the tariff talks may appear negative to certain parts of the market, they may also bring opportunities as well the ETF provider noted.

“Over the long term, the potential changes in the global trading ecosystem could create both disruptions and opportunities,” Vanguard’s senior international economist Kevin Khang stated.

“For instance, supply chains have already evolved since the 2018–2019 tariffs, with China now accounting for much less of the market share for U.S. imports than before 2018. These changes, though disruptive, can offer opportunities for new businesses positioned to take advantage and for astute active investors who can identify such businesses early on,” Khang added.

For investors looking to closely monitor the tariff situation, they may look towards exchange traded funds that focus around nations such as the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and China. See some funds below:
