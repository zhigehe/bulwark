Earnings Call Insights: Veeco Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:[VECO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VECO "Veeco Instruments Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Bill Miller highlighted 2024 as a successful year with milestones such as shipping an LSA system for 2-nanometer gate all-around logic chips and an agreement to ship an LSA evaluation to a second memory customer in 2025. The semiconductor business achieved record revenue, driven by laser annealing and advanced packaging growth.
* Revenue for 2024 reached $717 million, an 8% increase year-over-year, supported by a 13% growth in the semiconductor segment. Non-GAAP operating income rose to $116 million, while diluted non-GAAP EPS increased to $1.74.
* CFO John Kiernan noted that Q4 revenue totaled $182 million, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41. He also reported a year-end backlog of approximately $410 million, down $80 million, primarily due to reduced data storage business.

### Outlook

* Management projects Q1 2025 revenue between $155 million and $175 million, with gross margin at approximately 42% and diluted EPS ranging from $0.26 to $0.36.
* AI-driven advanced packaging revenue is expected to double in 2025, growing from $75 million in 2024 to approximately $150 million. Growth is attributed to capacity expansions by leading foundries and HBM manufacturers.
* China revenue is forecast to decline in 2025, contributing 25%-30% of first-half total revenue, down from 36% for the full year 2024, as customers digest capacity.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue of $182 million compared to analysts' estimate of $176.3 million, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.41 compared to an estimate of $0.40.
* Annual semiconductor revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $467 million, comprising 65% of total revenue. Gross margin for Q4 was 41.5%, impacted by product mix and evaluation program expenses.
* Cash and short-term investments increased to $345 million, with annual cash flow from operations at $64 million.

### Q&A

* Charles Shi, Needham & Company: Asked about China revenue trends and advanced packaging growth. CFO Kiernan clarified that China revenue for the first half of 2025 would decline but still represent 25%-30% of total revenue. CEO Miller noted advanced packaging would double in revenue to $150 million in 2025, driven by AI and wet processing technologies.
* Wei Mok, Oppenheimer: Inquired about NSA shipments and China regulatory impacts. CEO Miller confirmed NSA systems are gaining traction with multiple applications under evaluation. CFO Kiernan stated that regulatory changes in China have not affected short-term revenue visibility.
* Gus Richard, Northland Capital: Questioned LSA qualifications for gate-all-around and gross margin progression. CEO Miller confirmed all customers are qualified for gate-all-around and expected gross margins to stabilize at approximately 42% for 2025.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed neutral to slightly positive sentiment, focusing on China revenue normalization and advanced packaging growth. Questions highlighted uncertainties in China and optimism about AI-driven demand.
* Management conveyed confidence in growth areas such as advanced packaging and NSA systems but acknowledged headwinds in China and data storage. Statements like "we see this as a multiyear opportunity" reflected a forward-looking tone.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone remained consistent, with management emphasizing growth opportunities while addressing regional challenges.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted to emphasize AI-driven growth in advanced packaging, with a projected doubling of revenue in 2025. China’s declining contribution to revenue was reiterated, similar to the previous quarter.
* Gross margin guidance decreased to 42% from the 43%-44% range in Q3, reflecting product mix changes.
* Analysts maintained focus on China and advanced packaging, consistent with prior concerns.
* Management’s confidence in AI-related growth increased, while concerns regarding data storage persisted.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified declining revenue from China as a significant headwind, with a potential normalization to around 20% of total revenue by 2025 or 2026.
* Data storage revenue is expected to decline by $60 million to $70 million in 2025, with no new system sales anticipated.
