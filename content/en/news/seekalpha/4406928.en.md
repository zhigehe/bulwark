Airbnb (NASDAQ:[ABNB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB "Airbnb, Inc.")) is set to announce third quarter earnings on Thursday, after market close.

Wall Street [expects](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly) the San Francisco-based rental home company to post quarterly EPS of $0.58, while revenue is expected to rise 9% to $2.42 billion.

The company’s spending to boost its international market has helped it to double the growth rate of nights booked in its expansion markets versus its core markets. Earlier in November, the company [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4262829-airbnb-just-reported-earnings-here-is-why-shares-are-rallying) that gross booking value rose 10% year-over-year during its third quarter, while revenue grew 10%, primarily driven by solid growth in nights stayed and a modest increase in the average daily rate.

“We view the upcoming earnings report as a possible catalyst for shares as the focus shifts from margin uncertainty to accelerating room night growth and upcoming product launches,” said Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, adding that the brokerage expects 4Q gross bookings growth of +11.1% Y/Y.

UBS analyst Stephen Ju pointed out that on a regional basis, he expects “EMEA demand to continue to be driven by shorter lead times” which improved towards the back of the third quarter.

Investors will also focus on margin guidance to get more clarity on the company’s spending plans for the year. Analysts also believe that foreign exchange could be a headwind for Airbnb this quarter.

“Margins may remain moderately compressed in eFY25 as management intends on investing in its growth, core accommodation, and new offerings. Much of the growth in 2025 will be geared towards Airbnb's geographical footprint as well as new offerings,” [noted](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755964-airbnb-stock-beaten-down-buy-before-experiences-brings-it-back) Seeking Alpha analyst [Michael Del Monte](https://seekingalpha.com/author/michael-del-monte#source=url_first_level%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Aauthor_brief%3Amichael-del-monte%7Csection_asset%3Aauthor_brief%7Cauthor_name).

Over the last three months, EPS estimates have seen two [upward revisions](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/revisions) versus five downward revisions. Revenue estimates have been revised upwards seven times versus 10 downward moves.

Wall Street, Seeking Alpha analysts and Seeking Alpha's [Quant Ratings](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/ratings/quant-ratings#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews) are cautious and rated the company as a Hold.

The stock has lost nearly 13% so far this year, compared to the nearly 21% rise in the broader S&P500 Index.
