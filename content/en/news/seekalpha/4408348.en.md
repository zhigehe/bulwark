Earnings Call Insights: Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ:[UDMY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UDMY "Udemy, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Greg Brown highlighted that Udemy exceeded expectations across all key metrics, achieving 8% year-over-year revenue growth for 2024 and adjusted EBITDA significantly above guidance. The company is focusing on operational efficiency and driving growth through strategic resource allocation toward large enterprise customers. Brown described 2025 as a "transition year" with a clear plan to reaccelerate growth and unlock long-term opportunities.
* Brown noted progress in the enterprise segment, with ARR growth from large enterprise customers outpacing SMB ARR growth by 4 percentage points. The quarter also saw nearly 50 deals exceeding $100,000 in ARR, the highest for the year. Key new or expanded enterprise customers include Analog Devices, Arm, NASDAQ, and Kellanova.
* Founder and CTO Eren Bali emphasized leveraging AI to transform learning. Bali stated that Udemy is launching AI-assisted role-playing simulations and career academies in 2025 to expand career-oriented learning opportunities. The company is also enabling instructors to scale the creation of hands-on learning labs using AI.
* CFO Sarah Blanchard highlighted strong financial performance, with Q4 revenue up 5% year-over-year to approximately $200 million, and adjusted EBITDA reaching $19 million, or 10% of revenue. Gross margin for Udemy Business improved to 75%, driven by changes in the instructor revenue share. Blanchard reiterated the company’s focus on disciplined expense management and scalable revenue.

### Outlook

* Full-year 2025 revenue is expected to range between $787 million and $803 million, representing flat to 2% year-over-year growth, including a 2 percentage point FX headwind. Adjusted EBITDA guidance has been raised to $75 million to $85 million, approximately 10% of revenue.
* Q1 2025 revenue is projected between $195 million and $199 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $17 million and $19 million.
* Udemy anticipates 2025 Udemy Business revenue to grow approximately 5% year-over-year, with large enterprises continuing to outperform SMBs. Consumer revenue for 2025 is expected to decline approximately 6% year-over-year, including a 3 percentage point FX headwind.
* Blanchard confirmed plans to achieve $130 million to $150 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2026, supported by margin improvements from revenue mix shifts and changes to instructor revenue share.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue totaled nearly $200 million, with Udemy Business contributing $130 million, a 13% year-over-year increase. ARR for Udemy Business grew 11% to $517 million, while ARR from large enterprises increased 12%.
* Gross margin for Q4 improved by 500 basis points year-over-year to 64%, driven by the instructor revenue share change and higher revenue contribution from Udemy Business.
* Consumer segment revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $70 million, primarily due to lower individual course purchases, partially offset by personal plan subscriptions.
* The company ended 2024 with $356 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and free cash flow of $38 million.

### Q&A

* Jason Tilchen, Canaccord Genuity: Asked about customer interest in soft skills and role-play simulations. CEO Greg Brown highlighted early positive signals from large enterprise customers and improving win rates.
* Ryan MacDonald, Needham: Inquired about monetization opportunities in the consumer marketplace. CFO Sarah Blanchard noted a mix of better engagement and additional revenue from initiatives like career academies.
* Stephen Sheldon, William Blair: Asked about the sequential decline in Udemy Business revenue for Q1 2025. Blanchard attributed this to FX, SMB capacity reductions, and shorter quarter duration, with expectations for sequential growth resuming later in the year.
* Yi Fu Lee, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about net dollar retention trends. Blanchard acknowledged upsell pressures and longer sales cycles but emphasized stable gross dollar retention and efforts to support deeper customer engagement.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed caution about macroeconomic pressures, elongated sales cycles, and SMB headwinds but were generally optimistic about Udemy's enterprise focus and AI capabilities. Questions reflected interest in monetization, ARR growth, and product expansions.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding enterprise momentum and AI-led innovation. Brown frequently emphasized strategic focus and positive customer signals, while Blanchard outlined clear financial targets and disciplined cost management.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts showed increased interest in AI product impact and enterprise penetration. Management’s tone was consistent but slightly more forward-looking, with clearer articulation of 2025 priorities.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted to emphasize a "transition year" in 2025, with a focus on enterprise customers and operational efficiency. The prior quarter highlighted achieving new profitability milestones and setting the foundation for long-term growth.
* Strategic focus has evolved toward AI-driven innovation and upskilling solutions. While enterprise ARR growth remains strong, SMB reductions are expected to create near-term headwinds.
* Analysts in Q4 were more focused on AI product monetization and enterprise customer expansion compared to Q3, which centered on operational efficiency and cost savings.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted FX headwinds and the impact of a $20 million reduction in SMB capacity as challenges for 2025. Extended sales cycles and upsell pressures, particularly in EMEA, remain concerns.
* Analysts raised questions about retaining net dollar retention rates and sustaining consumer engagement amid declining revenue in that segment.

### Final Takeaway

Udemy concluded 2024 with strong financial performance and significant progress in its strategic shift toward enterprise customers and AI-driven innovation. While 2025 is positioned as a transition year with flat to modest revenue growth, the company is focused on scaling its AI capabilities, revitalizing its consumer marketplace, and driving operational efficiency to achieve $75 million to $85 million in adjusted EBITDA. Analysts expressed optimism regarding the company’s enterprise momentum and product roadmap but noted macroeconomic challenges and near-term headwinds in the consumer and SMB segments.
