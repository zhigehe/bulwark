A small innovation-focused biotech company called Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ:[NNOX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNOX "Nano-X Imaging Ltd.")) came to my attention about two years ago when I was researching the biotech industry. The healthcare sector in general has been on its tail in the last few years, lacking the broad market [by 53%](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-gb/adviser/article/trailing-the-sp-500-healthcare-stocks-look-deeply-undervalued/ "https://www.janushenderson.com/en-gb/adviser/article/trailing-the-sp-500-healthcare-stocks-look-deeply-undervalued/"). However, the S&P 500 is currently valued at its historically high level, and some of the lagging sectors like healthcare appear to be more attractive on a relative basis. On the other hand, the huge long-term demand in the healthcare industry may cause a rebound in the industry. I am now starting a buy rating on NNOX and view it as an interesting exposure to secular growth in the healthcare sector. I will explain later in the article that the current AI revolution will also be a key technology tailwind for this company.

Nano-X Overview
---------------

Nano-X Imaging Ltd. is a biotech company known for its innovative medical imaging systems. Its main product is **Nanox.ARC**, which is designed to make CT scanning much more affordable and accessible than products using the conventional approach. The company believes that its system is more operationally advantageous in both portability (accessibility) and energy-efficient usage. Its "groundbreaking" X-ray imaging device is not only smaller in size and simpler to operate but also more affordable than traditional X-ray machines.

The company's goal is to make Nanox.ARC "*as a standard equipment, alongside traditional x-ray and CT technologies.*" Overall, the company is still in its early growth phase. Nanox.ARC has received [FDA approvals](https://nano-ximaging.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nanoxarc-imaging-system-receives-fda-clearance-general-use/ "https://nano-ximaging.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nanoxarc-imaging-system-receives-fda-clearance-general-use/") with deployment at healthcare facilities in seven states in the US. The company is certainly looking for an inflection point where much faster revenue growth can be achieved from a wider acceptance of its products and services.

According to the [Q3 report](https://investors.nanox.vision/news-releases/news-release-details/nanox-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and "https://investors.nanox.vision/news-releases/news-release-details/nanox-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and") of 2024, the company had total cash, and cash equivalents of about $57.1 million, while the operations cost $26.1 million in Q3. More details can be found in the following sheet of current assets provided by NNOX for the 9 months of 2024.

NNOX Q3 balance sheet - from Nanox





Notice that the company has more cash than debt, which has created some room in the short term for continuing to expand its capabilities in the competitive market of medical imaging and diagnosis and, more importantly, building a more attractive business model for its product. This cash position is critical for NNOX in the foreseeable future, as it is not expected to make money anytime soon. The GAAP net loss reported in the recent quarter is substantial, at $13.6 million. I expect two or three quarters that would be covered financially with the current balance before any new funding would be needed.

Golden pass to wider acceptation
--------------------------------

The FDA approvals such as the most recent [tomosynthesis feature](https://www.investing.com/news/swot-analysis/nanoxs-swot-analysis-aidriven-imaging-stock-faces-growth-hurdles-93CH-3776288 "https://www.investing.com/news/swot-analysis/nanoxs-swot-analysis-aidriven-imaging-stock-faces-growth-hurdles-93CH-3776288") for Nanox.ARC systems are huge in that the FDA 510k clearance is like a golden pass. The system can be allowed to be used in all healthcare facilities including hospitals, clinics, medical institutions, imaging centers, etc.

It opens up potential revenue streams, especially in places where access to advanced imaging is limited. The following from [Q3 conference](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739377-nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739377-nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript") calls are some positive numbers and signs:

* The usage rate of each system is boosted from an average of seven scans per day to maybe even 20.
* Commercial deployment is about 47 units and there are close to 50 that are in the pipeline for both commercial and clinical use
* The company plans to double the pipeline, expanding sales staff, service, and support teams in key U.S. markets and driving revenue in sales

From a business perspective, I see NNOX tapping into a huge market with unlimited potential for usage. According to Nanox,

> Up to 33% of adults and 75% of older adults in the world suffer from multiple chronic conditions, which are often undiagnosed, increasing chances of hospitalization and death.

It can be easily seen that the uses of the diagnosis, scans, and data collection can be much more due to the recurrent nature of the need and the process involved.

Radiology AI innovations are secular tailwinds
----------------------------------------------

Imagine you have a full body scan and AI comes in to analyze the data in seconds and inform any "findings". This is one of the perfect scenarios where I see that the "red-hot" AI innovation could bring great value on a large scale in the healthcare field. I believe that the secular growth opportunities for Nanox come from its promising AI solution, Nanox.AI, which interprets CT scan data and applies advanced AI models to analyze the data and help identify some key ailments, including "coronary artery disease, musculoskeletal disease, and fatty liver" according to the company's statement.

Notice that one of the major industry trends is the increase in the use of AI in Healthcare. As shown below, it is widely expected that AI in the Healthcare Market will pick up the pace and grow at a CAGR of 48.5% to reach $153.61 billion in 2029.

AI Market in Healthcare - from Research and Markets





I expect NNOX's products and services will find their revenue to pick up significantly once the healthcare sectors start to embrace AI systems in scale. It may happen sooner than we would imagine given the rapid development of AI technology and the fact that huge money has been [invested](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240822210358/en/Artificial-Intelligence-AI-in-Healthcare-Market-Focused-Research-2024-2029-Featuring-Google-AWS-Microsoft-Medtronic-NVIDIA-Siemens-Healthineers-Intel-Merative-and-Augmedix---ResearchAndMarkets.com "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240822210358/en/Artificial-Intelligence-AI-in-Healthcare-Market-Focused-Research-2024-2029-Featuring-Google-AWS-Microsoft-Medtronic-NVIDIA-Siemens-Healthineers-Intel-Merative-and-Augmedix---ResearchAndMarkets.com") from mega companies like Amazon, and Microsoft, just to name a few.

NNOX's use of AI to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses should be a game-changer in medical imaging. Its AI solution is also easy to use, and integrated with existing picture archiving and communication systems, and electronic medical record systems, including 30M records, and 500 images as indicated below:

NNOX AI experience - from Nanox





In the future, I believe that Nanox.AI can have a lot of opportunities to generate more value by integrating with many systems and operations with "a wide spectrum of imaging protocols", such as the EMR integration for streamlining care that could be easier to use, and make a substantial impact.

Incremental positioning is the right approach
---------------------------------------------

NNOX is a very volatile stock that can be categorized as a speculative growth name. The stock carries a price-to-sale ratio of about 30 with no earnings. I have a very limited weight in my portfolio for this type of play. I currently use the option wheel strategy to build my NNOX position. The approach involves selling PUT (also known as cash-secured for the underlying NNOX shares) collecting the premium, and using the proceeds to buy the NNOX shares. When the PUT gets assigned, I can optionally sell covered calls and buy more shares with the call option premium.

The following is the put option chain for March:

[![https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NNOX/options?expiration=2025-03-21-m](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/44152406-17394998782202108.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/44152406-17394998782202108_origin.png)



NNOX PUT Option Chain - from bartchart.com





It can be seen that $7.5 PUT can be sold for about $0.81 which represents about 11% premium based on the current stock price of $7.55. Notice that this option has IV of 90% which is very high. Selling PUT is a conservative way to build the NNOX position by taking advantage of the volatile options. To capture the greater upside potential, the premium can be used to buy NNOX shares. This approach is known as the option wheel.

Keep in mind if the stock price drops below $7.5, I will get 100 shares assigned for 1 PUT sold. I can sell call on these shares to get additional fund and buy more shares. If the stock price is over $7.5 at the PUT expiration date, my gain is limited to $0.81. But the put selling process can continue.

Investors could use the PUT premium to buy long-call options to build an NNOX position (known as synthetic position) with a much lower starting capital and much limited (total) loss in case the hockey stick growth explosion never happens.

Risk Analysis
-------------

The growth promises are built on disruptive innovation to replace the existing X-imaging services, which would not be scaled to cover multiple needs and lack streamlined AI-related services. There is always a risk that the new technology may fail to take the market in time, and product adoption may require other factors to work together.

The company has been around for a few years, but its revenue growth has been rather disappointing for some investors. This may potentially indicate limited acceptance or limited use cases. The full-body scan and new features newly approved via FDA 510k clearance should be a "big opener" for its revenue growth. Investors want to pay closer attention to the upcoming quarters for any evidence of growth pick-up or indication that the "hockey stick" moment may not materialize any time soon. If revenue disappointment occurs, the stock could plummet.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

NNOX seems to be positioned well in the anticipated fast-growing AI healthcare market. Its product addresses an underserved market where affordable medical imaging for the full body is needed and information can be easily accessed for health care purposes. NNOX is a small-cap stock that could be a beneficiary for multiple market tailwinds, including the small-cap rotation in the market and the AI Apps in the healthcare industry. I have a buy rating on NNOX, and I view it as a speculative growth play in 2025, which could be a good candidate on investors' watch list for secular growth exposures.
