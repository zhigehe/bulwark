He emphasized the company's success in achieving $20B in cumulative debt commitments over its 20-year history.
* Bluestein noted a continued focus on defensive balance sheet management, maintaining a 91% first-lien exposure in Q4 and over $1.1B in liquidity across the platform. He stated, "We are incredibly well-positioned to benefit from a more favorable originations market in 2025."

### Financial Results
