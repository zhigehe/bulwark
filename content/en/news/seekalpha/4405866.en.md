* SelectQuote (NYSE:[SLQT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLQT "SelectQuote, Inc.")) shares rose more than 30% in extended trading on Monday after it [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997276-selectquote-announces-350-million-strategic-investment-from-bain-capital-morgan-stanley) a $350M strategic investment from funds managed by Bain Capital, Morgan Stanley Private Credit, and Newlight Partners.

* The companyâ€™s renegotiation of its Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a lower interest rate on the remaining balance.
