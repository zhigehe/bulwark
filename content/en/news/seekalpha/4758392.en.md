Investment environment
----------------------

Global financial markets performance was mixed in the fourth quarter. In November, Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election sparked a strong U.S. equity market rally, with investors hoping his economic policies would underpin continued U.S. economic growth. However, Trump’s threats to ignite a global trade war pressured non-U.S. equities. Equity markets were broadly weak in December following hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank.

Fixed income investments declined in both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, as bond yields rose across most sovereign curves.

Portfolio review
----------------

In the fixed income market, the portfolio held an underweight in U.S. fixed income securities. These investments were positive contributors to relative performance. A portfolio overweight in unhedged international sovereigns slightly detracted from relative performance, however, as international bonds generally declined during the quarter.

The portfolio held an overweight in U.S. equities. While U.S. stocks broadly outperformed international shares in the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s U.S. equity investments were relative detractors. Investments in international equities, where the portfolio was modestly underweight, contributed positively to relative performance.

Over the period, the portfolio’s equity and fixed income exposures averaged 65.19% and 32.27%, respectively.

Manager outlook
---------------

The global economy remains late cycle, and any incremental risk-taking should be approached with caution. As global monetary policy diverges, and economic broadening impacts sectors in varying degrees, investors should seek to balance a security’s ability to benefit from the cycle’s extension with its valuation.

The U.S. economy’s streak of outperforming other advanced countries looks set to continue. This is not, however, the full-throated, risk-on environment typically associated with the advent of a new cycle.

We remain neutral on Europe, despite signs of steadying economic activity. The region’s central banks were earlier than the Fed in lowering rates, but that was due to necessity. China, on the other hand, could break out of an extended stupor, now that the central government has communicated intentions to deliver meaningful stimulus.

Any shift in U.S. economic policy will undoubtedly reverberate through the corporate sector and financial markets. Deregulatory, corporate tax, and other pro-growth aspects of the incoming administration’s agenda would likely be favorable for riskier assets. However, tariffs and other policy initiatives may present risks to growth.

Although an extension of the cycle should be conducive for riskier assets, valuations are elevated, with most equity segments’ price-to-earnings ratios residing in the top quartile of their long-term average.

Despite the possibility of broadening economic growth, small- and mid-cap stocks are one of the few categories within the U.S. where earnings estimates still have meaningful potential to grow into their valuations. And although broader participation in the equities rally is a welcome development, investors should not lose sight of the Magnificent 7’s continued ability to beat expectations.

The price of fighting inflation was steep for bond investors. But with most of that battle behind us, the new, higher range of bond yields globally has left the asset class in a better position to deliver steady income and diversification to riskier assets.

In the U.S., the Treasuries yield curve reset to higher levels and steepened in the wake of November’s election. Although having already sold off, longer-dated bond yields could face additional pressure if economic growth further surprises to the upside, or trade policies and robust wages prove inflationary.

Corporate credits are richly valued. A candidate for incremental allocation in this space would likely be higher-quality, high-yield issuers, as this category provides more carry and a larger yield cushion. Securitized credits, by contrast, appear more fairly valued and stand to benefit from rising values of their underlying assets.

Outside the U.S., diverging economic fortunes and monetary policy create opportunities. Europe, for example, likely has little choice but to continue its accommodative course, keeping a tailwind for sovereign yields intact.

Portfolios typically invest in a diversified portfolio of Janus Henderson funds and ETFs as well as external ETFs, normally consisting of approximately 60% stocks and 40% bonds and money market securities.

Performance attribution is a method used to analyze and quantify the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its benchmark and does not represent actual performance. Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion.
