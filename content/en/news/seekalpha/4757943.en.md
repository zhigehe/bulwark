Investment action
-----------------

I recommended a [hold rating](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740644-leslies-stock-upside-unlikely-as-demand-environment-remains-poor) for Leslie’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:[LESL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LESL "Leslie's, Inc.")) when I wrote about it in November’24 as I expected consumer demand to remain poor given how the macro environment was previously. There also weren’t any strong signs of demand returning anytime soon. Based on my current outlook and analysis, I recommend a hold rating. I acknowledge that LESL has shown some early signs of stabilization, particularly with Pro Pool sales growth and inventory improvements. However, I believe LESL still faces several near-term challenges that make a bullish stance difficult to justify. Profitability remains weak, macroeconomic headwinds persist, and its turnaround strategy is still in its early stages. If management can pull off its turnaround strategy successfully and the macro backdrop turns, the stock could see major upgrades, especially since it is heavily levered. Hence, I think a more cautious stance is warranted for now.

### Review

LESL [reported 1Q25](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LESL/earnings) revenue of $175.2 million, a 0.7% y/y increase, and this is very notable because sales had been declining for the past seven quarters. Even more notable, comparable sales growth saw 0.2% y/y, marking the first positive comp since 4Q22. The main driver was Pro Pool sales, which grew 9.3% y/y, which is very encouraging as it reflects LESL’s efforts to deepen relationships with commercial customers and expand its footprint in the professional service segment have worked. While equipment sales were still down 4% y/y, this is a remarkable improvement from -18% y/y in 1Q24, suggesting that demand *may be stabilizing*. However, not everything is rosy. Residential pool sales declined 0.8% y/y, and hot tub sales were down 4.8% y/y, reinforcing the ongoing softness in discretionary consumer spending. Profitability also remains a major issue. Gross margins fell 175 basis points y/y to 27.2%, and this led to an adj EBITDA performance of -$29.3 million. Adj EPS also came in poorly at -$0.22.

Looking ahead into FY25, I respect management’s decision to be cautious given how things have been. The guide calls for revenue to be in the range of $1.30 - $1.37 billion, implying flat to 3% y/y growth; adj EBITDA at $96 - $116 million, and adj EPS in the range of -$0.01 to $0.07.

Overall, I consider LESL 1Q25 results a relatively positive one compared to the past few quarters. However, I think switching to a bullish stance is still very difficult today. In my view, one of the biggest headwinds LESL continues to face is the poor macroeconomic environment. Interest rates [remain high](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate) with no signs of [major cuts](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-wait-months-next-rate-cut-tariffs-risk-inflation-flare-up-2025-02-11/), housing market activity [remains soft](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/existing-home-sales), and discretionary spending [remains weak](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html), all of which are major headwinds for LESL. Unless macro conditions improve significantly, it will be difficult for LESL to report meaningful revenue growth.

Next, I think management’s turnaround strategy has potential, but the execution risks are high. The way I see it, there are three major initiatives that management is relying on to drive improvement:

* Expanding Local Fulfillment Centers [LFCs]: LESL has so far introduced 26 LFCs, serving as inventory hubs to improve product availability and reduce logistics costs. This could help improve margins over time, but if utilization ramps up slower than expected, near-term margins could take a hit, and there will be minimal positive impacts.
* Scaling Pro customer expansion: This seems like a logical move given the positive momentum that LESL is seeing with its Pro Pool sales (up 9.3% y/y in 1Q25), but I am unsure if this is the right time to ramp up operations as underlying demand is *very uncertain*. Remember that underlying sales for Pro Customers (e.g., consumer outsourcing cleaning services) are tied even more towards discretionary spending (the alternative is to do it themselves to save costs). If the ramp-up does not come with improved demand, this would just mean elevated operating costs in the near term.
* Enhancing inventory efficiency: This is good, in my opinion. Management managed to reduce inventory by $63 million (-19% y/y), which has resulted in improved working capital and allowed LESL to pay down some debt. However, these savings have yet to translate into margin benefits, so there is *a lot more to be done*, which I wonder if LESL can cut as much inventory as they want to if they are expanding LFCs.

Finally, LESL's balance sheet is a big concern. It ended 1Q25 with $757 million in debt, translating to a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 7.5x, which is a very high level. This significantly restricts LESL's ability to reinvest into the business (e.g., expand its store count or fund long-term growth aggressively) or growth through acquisition. In short, there is little wiggle room, financially, for LESL to make big bets, which means the path to recovery is going to be slow. Without significant margin expansion (to drive up profits to give it cash), I believe LESL will remain trapped in a cycle of weak earnings and high debt, making a material valuation re-rating difficult.

### Valuation

At this point, for anyone that wants to invest in LESL, it is really a bet on the US macroeconomy recovering over the next 12 months—which appears to be what the market is implying with the current 25x forward PE multiple that LESL trades at. I don’t know the probability of this happening, but it is fair to assume that it *may happen*. This could drive up equity value by a huge magnitude given how levered LESL is, and also because the stock has already been beaten down to a very low level.

Overall, I neither have a strong view of LESL’s stock getting sold heavily again because it's already at near penny stock levels, but also have no strong view for a major valuation upgrade because of the headwinds and limitations I mentioned above. Hence, the best move forward is to just avoid participating in this stock for now.

Final thoughts
--------------

My recommendation is a hold. While LESL has made some progress, I still think it is very difficult to turn bullish at this juncture. The improvement in sales trends is encouraging, but margin pressures, high debt, and execution risks make it difficult to justify a buy rating. Hence, I think the best path forward is to be neutral on the stock, acknowledging both the headwinds ahead and the potential for a turnaround if execution improves.
