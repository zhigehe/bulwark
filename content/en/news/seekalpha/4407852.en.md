Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook teased the launch of the tech giant's upcoming iPhone SE with a post on X on Thursday.

"Get ready to meet the newest member of the family," Cook wrote in the [post](https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918 "post"). "Wednesday, February 19."

Shares rose 1.6% in late morning trading.

The iPhone SE, expected to be priced around $499, will be the first iPhone with an in-house modem. Apple has [traditionally](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4371939-apple-makes-roadmap-for-self-made-cellular-modems-potentially-challenging-qualcomm-dominance-report "traditionally") relied on Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")) for its modem chips.

Apple first introduced the iPhone SE in 2016, but a lack of features have led to slow sales of the device. The company most recently refreshed the iPhone SE in 2022 and is still the only iPhone that has a home button and does not use Face ID. The new iPhone SE is likely to incorporate Apple Intelligence and have a similar form factor to the iPhone 14.

The launch of the iPhone SE comes at a time when Apple is looking to reinvigorate revenue growth from the iconic device, which was first announced in 2007. Revenue attributed to the iPhone fell 1% year-over-year in the most [recent quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401015-apple-slips-as-services-reach-record-high-china-iphone-sales-slump "recent quarter") to $69.14B, below the $71.04B estimate.

Despite concerns of stagnation, CEO Cook said on the company's earnings call that he believes there is still more room for innovation in the smartphone category, particularly around form factor. "I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline," Cook said. "So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone."
