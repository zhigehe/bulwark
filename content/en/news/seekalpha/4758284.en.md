Martin Barraud





Qualys (NASDAQ:[QLYS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QLYS "Qualys, Inc.")) is a cloud-based enterprise cybersecurity company I have been following for a while. In the past I have covered the stock twice, with [the most recent one](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684723-qualys-recent-pullback-due-to-over-reaction-risk-reward-remains-attractive) in April last year, when I assigned the stock a buy rating. Back then, the stock was trading at around $163 per share.

Looking at where QLYS is trading today at $137 per share, it appears that my April bullish call has been quite a miss. Though QLYS would go on and reach a 1-year high of $172 per share just two weeks after my published coverage, the stock then continued trending down until November, when it started to gain momentum and tested $150 price level, before seeing a further downtrend to reach where it is today, down about -16% from the price at my last coverage.

I maintain my buy rating for QLYS. My conservative 1-year price target of $150 projects about 9% upside. Risk-reward is attractive.

QLYS has maintained decent fundamentals as of Q4 2024. Revenue growth has slowed down to 10% from just under 20% about 2 years ago. However, profit margin and operating cash flow (OCF) generation have improved within the same period. In Q4, profit margin was 27%, pretty much the similar level to where it was last year and almost 600 bps higher already from two years ago. QLYS also generated over $244 million of OCF, the similar amount it made last year that has already been a significant improvement in the past two years. At the end of 2022, for instance, QLYS only managed to generate just under $200 million of OCF.

Consequently, QLYS has been able to continue its share repurchase activity without any issues. In 2024, QLYS repurchased about $140 million worth of shares. This has remained the major use of cash for the company. QLYS ended FY 2024 with over $381 million of cash and short-term investments. Though the liquidity level here is lower than the same time last year, overall liquidity remains solid, in my view.

Catalyst
--------

I believe QLYS’ ETM (Enterprise TruRisk Management) and ROC (Risk Operations Center) could be differentiated solutions that would address the sticky enterprise vendor-consolidation trends more efficiently. Started in recent years, the vendor-consolidation trend has stemmed from growing needs of large enterprises to reduce operational cost by rationalizing the use of third-party enterprise solutions. In the end, this has affected many cloud solution providers across verticals, including those in the cybersecurity space, influencing them to realign their product and sales strategies around bundled offerings at better projected ROI on the customers’ ends.

As the CEO pointed out in the Q4 earnings call, a key highlight of the product would be the platform’s capability to be comprehensive while quantifying the risk from a business perspective. In my view, this would be a unique problem-solving capability at the executive level that could drive longer-term adoption, as illustrated by the management:

> Today, they say we fix so many things and we had so many issues, but that doesn't mean anything to the business. ETM allows them to go out and be able to say, look, our $500 million business as a potential loss of $10 million a day. And currently, based on risk signals from multiple different products, the possibility of that happening is high. And if we invest $500,000, we can bring that risk down to an acceptable level and so now it is a much better conversation that the CISOs can have with the CFOs to say, "Look, we can invest $500,000 in this particular area of cybersecurity and to bring down the potential of losing $10 million a day by 80%, that's a much better conversation

Furthermore, given the increasing reliance on channel partners as a go-to-market strategy, I believe QLYS would continue to see stronger international growth in a more scalable and capital efficient way, even more so if ETM and ROC deliver as expected.

10K





While geographically the US has been where QLYS has generated the majority of its revenue, we have seen how international growth has accelerated significantly over the recent years. Looking at the company’s [10K for FY 2023](https://investor.qualys.com/node/17331/html#i0668aaa2a4b841bfbaf18f9d4436768b_46), we can clearly see how international business grew by just under 13% last fiscal year, still outpaced by US growth. As of the end of FY 2024, this is no longer the case, since the international business accelerated to 15%, far outpacing 7% growth in the US. Historically making up just about 40% of the business, the international segment also saw a growing dominance in driving overall QLYS’ business, making up 42% of the business as per the latest quarter.

Risk
----

I believe risk appears minimal. Though ETM and ROC appear to be promising solutions, I may consider enterprise product education, sales cycle, and channel partner alignment as key areas where issues may arise.

First off, pushing ETM and ROC through channel partners would increase the deal size, which while beneficial for the channel partners to some extent, it also means that some deals may take longer to close. Meanwhile, product education both on the clients and channel partners’ ends could also present a bottleneck due to the potential complexity of the solutions.

In the end, some of these issues could translate into higher unexpected sales and marketing (S&M) expenses for QLYS, which have historically been the largest operating expense item for the company. So far, QLYS has done relatively well in maintaining a disciplined growth approach as of Q4 2024. S&M grew by just under 9%, still not outpacing revenue growth despite the top-line slowdown. As such, I believe any unexpected go-to-market challenges could directly negatively affect operating and eventually share performance.

Valuation / Pricing
-------------------

My target price for QLYS is driven by the following assumptions for the bull vs bear scenarios of the FY 2025 projection:

1. Bull scenario (50% probability) assumptions - I expect QLYS to achieve an FY 2025 revenue of $659.2 million, a 8.5% growth YoY, in line with the [market’s estimate](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QLYS/earnings/estimates). I assume a forward P/S to expand to 9x, implying a share price appreciation to $160.
2. Bear scenario (50% probability) assumptions - QLYS to deliver FY 2025 revenue of $645 million, missing the low-end of the market’s estimate slightly, growing at 6% YoY. I assign QLYS a forward P/S of 8x, lower than where it is trading today.

own analysis





Consolidating all the information above into my model, I arrived at an FY 2025 weighted target price of $150 per share, projecting just about 9% 1-year gain from the current price of $137. I would maintain my buy rating for the stock.

Again, as I did in my earlier analysis of QLYS, I applied a conservative approach. I assumed no share repurchase activities and also lowered my bear-case revenue projection. Furthermore, 8x forward P/S seems to be overly conservative since QLYS has not yet tested that level yet YTD, while the stock has already traded at 9x, as per my bull projection, in January. QLYS still appears undervalued, in my opinion.

Conclusion
----------

QLYS maintains its decent fundamentals despite the recent sideways movement. The shift in go-to-market strategy as QLYS relies more on enterprise channel partners seems to be a positive note, especially since QLYS will focus more on marketing its unique enterprise offerings, ETM and ROC. Risk remains minimal. I maintain my buy rating.
