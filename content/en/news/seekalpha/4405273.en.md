Earnings Call Insights: GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:[EAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EAF "GrafTech International Ltd.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Tim Flanagan emphasized GrafTech’s progress in its strategic initiatives, including a 13% year-over-year increase in sales volume despite flat global graphite electrode demand. He highlighted the successful launch of the 800-millimeter product offering, which is expected to drive growth in future years.
* Flanagan stated that the company achieved a 23% year-over-year reduction in cash COGS per metric ton, exceeding initial projections. He also noted $40 million in working capital reductions for the year and a strengthened liquidity position of $464 million following a financing transaction that extended most debt maturities to December 2029.
* COO Jeremy Halford shared that Q4 production volume reached 25,000 metric tons, with a capacity utilization rate of 55%. Sales volume was 27,000 metric tons, driven by higher commitments from key regions such as the U.S. and Europe.
* CFO Rory O'Donnell reported a net loss of $49 million for Q4 and highlighted that adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $7 million from negative $22 million in Q4 2023, supported by cost reductions.

### Outlook

* Flanagan noted that the company is targeting low double-digit sales volume growth for 2025, building on its market share recovery efforts and increased customer engagement.
* GrafTech announced a 15% price increase on uncommitted 2025 volumes, aiming to restore pricing and profitability levels. Flanagan described this as a critical step to address unsustainable current pricing levels. He acknowledged ongoing challenges in pricing dynamics but emphasized the need for higher average selling prices to support long-term investments.
* Halford stated that volume growth in 2025 will focus on the U.S. and European regions, supported by the introduction of the 800-millimeter product and new multi-year agreements.

### Financial Results

* Q4 net sales declined 2% year-over-year, reflecting lower pricing and a shift in business mix from LTA to non-LTA volumes. Non-LTA weighted average pricing was $3,900 per metric ton, down 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year.
* The company delivered a full-year cash COGS reduction of 23%, bringing it to $4,290 per metric ton, exceeding prior guidance. For 2025, GrafTech expects a mid-single-digit decline in cash COGS per metric ton, targeting approximately $4,100 for the full year.
* Liquidity increased to $464 million by year-end 2024, supported by a strategic financing transaction that reduced near-term debt maturity pressures.

### Q&A

* Abe Landa, Bank of America: Questioned the impact of tariffs on Mexican imports. CFO Rory O'Donnell explained that the company’s integrated supply chain offers flexibility to shift production among its facilities to minimize tariff impact. He confirmed that 60% of 2025 volume commitments account for current tariff expectations.
* Bennett Moore, JPMorgan: Inquired about customer reactions to the 15% price hike. Flanagan responded that early feedback has been supportive, citing the small cost impact relative to steel production margins.
* Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets: Asked about market share recovery. Flanagan emphasized ongoing efforts through customer engagement and the introduction of value-added services such as the Architect furnace productivity system.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism about the sustainability of pricing improvements, given persistent competitive pressures. Questions focused on market dynamics, cost reductions, and the feasibility of achieving higher prices.
* Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, particularly regarding the potential for market share recovery and the impact of new product offerings. Flanagan’s remarks on pricing increases and cost reductions reflected confidence in long-term profitability.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts maintained a slightly negative tone on near-term pricing challenges, while management’s tone was consistent, focusing on strategic actions and long-term opportunities.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Sales volume increased from 26,000 metric tons in Q3 to 27,000 metric tons in Q4, reflecting growth in customer commitments.
* Q4 cash COGS per metric ton improved to $4,100 from $4,200 in Q3, continuing the downward trend in costs.
* Management maintained its focus on market share recovery and cost control, consistent with Q3 priorities. However, the tone on pricing dynamics grew more urgent, with the announcement of a 15% price increase.
* Analysts continued to focus on pricing and competitive pressures, similar to concerns raised in the previous quarter.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified geopolitical uncertainties, including tariffs on Mexican imports, as a potential risk to supply chain operations. Mitigation strategies include leveraging flexibility in its global production network.
* Persistent pricing challenges were noted as a critical issue, with management emphasizing the need for higher average selling prices to sustain profitability and growth.
* Analysts raised concerns about the impact of sustained low pricing on profitability, particularly given the competitive dynamics in key regions.

### Final Takeaway

GrafTech is focused on executing its strategic initiatives to navigate challenging market conditions. Key actions include cost reductions, a targeted 15% price increase for 2025, and market share recovery strategies supported by new product offerings such as the 800-millimeter electrodes.
