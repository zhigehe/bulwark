Earnings Call Insights: Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA ([OTCPK:NWARF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWARF "Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Norwegian Air Shuttle achieved over 50% market share in Norway, supported by 70% of passenger growth in Avinor airports during 2024 flowing to its airlines. Passenger numbers reached 6.2 million in Q4, with a 19% capacity increase year-over-year.
* CEO Geir Karlsen highlighted the delivery of three new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, with plans to receive four ahead of summer 2025. A slower growth rate of 4% is projected for 2025 compared to 18% and 13% in the prior two years, enabling a focus on cost efficiency and synergies.
* The company launched “Program X,” a profitability initiative targeting cost reductions, revenue optimization, and efficiency improvements. A Chief Performance Officer role has been created to oversee this program.
* Wideroe contributed NOK 1.8 billion in revenue in Q4, with a 13% year-over-year passenger increase and improved load factors. The commercial side of Wideroe was notably profitable, which has not been typical in recent years.
* CFO Hans-Joergen reported Q4 group revenue of NOK 8.2 billion, up 39% from the prior year. EBIT came in at negative NOK 93 million, impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and nonrecurring items.

### Outlook

* Norwegian Air Shuttle expects a 15% capacity growth in Q1 2025, reducing to 5% from April onwards and 2% by the end of the year. The company is optimistic about stable or improving yields from Q2 2025.
* The company plans to take deliveries of 11 to 13 aircraft in 2025, aiming to increase the fleet size to 94–96 aircraft by year-end.
* Program X is expected to deliver results on profitability, cost reduction, and synergies with Wideroe over the next 12 to 24 months.
* Management expressed confidence in booking trends for 2025, with forward load factors and revenue above prior-year levels from April onwards.

### Financial Results

* Total Q4 revenue reached NOK 8.2 billion, driven by a 39% growth year-over-year. Wideroe contributed NOK 1.8 billion to the revenue figure.
* Passenger growth was strong, with a 32% increase year-over-year, maintaining a load factor between 80% and 90%. Ancillary revenue per passenger rose to NOK 188, up from NOK 173.
* The quarter's net loss was NOK 223 million, while EBIT was negatively affected by NOK 206 million in foreign exchange impacts and NOK 372 million in nonrecurring items.
* The company ended the quarter with NOK 9.9 billion in cash and an equity ratio of 19.3%.

### Q&A

* Unidentified Analyst: "You have a regularity target of 99.5%. I didn't hear you say any punctuality target, which currently is around slightly below 80%, at least in Q4." CEO Geir Karlsen: "The target internally is 85%. That's what we are striving for every single day."
* Hans-Erik Jacobsen, Nordea: "You guide for plus single-digit increase in nonfuel unit cost ex-fuel. Is this low, mid, high single digit?" CEO Karlsen: "We are guiding on a single-digit cost increase...and hopefully, we can narrow that guiding during the next quarters."
* Andrew Lobbenberg, Barclays: "SAS now out of bankruptcy. Are they winning back some of the corporate traffic that you gained in recent years?" CEO Karlsen: "I don't think so...we are gaining market share."
* Ole Martin Westgaard, DNB Markets: "How much did wet leases impact your operations in 2024? And what are your plans there for 2025?" CEO Karlsen: "The impact on wet lease in 2024 was somewhere between NOK 300 million and NOK 400 million. For 2025, we anticipate a very limited need for wet lease."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about cost guidance, competitive pressures from SAS and Ryanair, and the Boeing delivery delays. Their tone was neutral to slightly skeptical, pressing for more specifics on Program X and synergies with Wideroe.
* Management demonstrated confidence during prepared remarks, emphasizing growth opportunities and cost management plans. However, they were more cautious in responding to analysts' questions, particularly regarding EBIT guidance and Boeing-related uncertainties.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone reflected a greater focus on operational challenges, while analysts maintained consistent skepticism.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 guidance emphasized a sharp slowdown in capacity growth for 2025, compared to the prior focus on expansion outlined in Q3.
* The introduction of Program X marks a strategic shift toward cost efficiency and operational streamlining, a pivot from Q3’s emphasis on growth and network expansion.
* Analysts in Q4 sought more clarity on synergies from Wideroe and cost implications, while Q3 questions centered on competitive positioning and forward bookings.
* Management’s tone in Q4 was more measured, reflecting the operational challenges from currency headwinds and Boeing delays, contrasting with the optimistic tone in Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management flagged currency depreciation of the Norwegian Krone, which impacted costs, particularly on fuel and maintenance.
* Boeing delivery delays and strike-related issues remain a significant operational risk, influencing both capacity plans and cost structures.
* Rising aviation charges in Norway and potential competitive pressures from SAS and Ryanair were noted as potential risks to market share and profitability.
* Analysts highlighted lingering uncertainties around Program X and its timeline for delivering tangible financial benefits.

### Final Takeaway

Norwegian Air Shuttle is pivoting its focus toward cost efficiency and operational streamlining through its newly launched Program X, while projecting a reduced capacity growth of 4% for 2025. The company remains confident in its market leadership in Norway and the synergies anticipated from its collaboration with Wideroe. However, challenges such as currency headwinds, Boeing delivery delays, and competitive pressures from SAS and Ryanair pose risks that investors should closely monitor in the coming quarters.
