Currently, there are many unknowns and significant risks in the market. We have tariffs, sanctions, AI-driven energy demand, a hot labor market, potentially reduced taxes on the horizon, etc. However, all of this has one thing in common - i.e., pressure on the inflation rate, which, in turn, translates to a higher-for-longer scenario. In fact, there has been even an increased chatter around the Fed potentially increasing the base rates to combat inflation going forward. Granted, it is not the [base case](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), but then again, I think you would agree with me that the FOMC (or the market) has been so many times wrong here since 2022, where we just have to take each "base scenario" with a grain of salt.

The FOMC dot plot from December 2024 indicates a gradually declining interest rate curve, which as we already know is wrong. The market has now given the [highest probability](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) to 400-425 bps level ending 2025.

So, in my opinion, what we have to take into account is the following:

* Converging back to ~2% or even a lower interest rate environment seems very unlikely.
* Refinancing risk is still out there for those companies that had assumed below market-level borrowings before the interest rates surged higher.
* High-duration assets might remain depressed for a longer period of time.
* Businesses that can pass through the higher financing costs/inflation to the customers look quite interesting now.

With this in mind, let me elaborate on two dividend-driven securities that are likely to benefit from the higher-for-longer scenario.

**#1 - Mid-America Apartment Communities**
------------------------------------------

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. ([MAA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAA "Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.")) is an S&P 500 REIT with a pure-play focus on residential properties in the Sunbelt region.

The beauty of residential REITs is that they embody excellent inflation-pass-through that is based on short-term rent agreements. Namely, most REITs venture into long-term rent/lease agreements that lock in prices and come with relatively minor price escalators. Yet, in the case of residential REITs, the contracts are resigned quite frequently, allowing the property owners to quickly synchronize pricing with the actual supply/demand dynamics.

Another key advantage of residential REITs is that they play in an asset class for which there is a secular demand in place and, importantly, a favorable medium-term supply/demand balance (or rather an imbalance). Since the interest rates are elevated, it costs a lot to build new housing and take new mortgage. This has led to two things: 1) depressed levels of new construction, and 2) higher residential rent prices.

The chart below captures this essence nicely.

MAA Q3, 2024 Earnings Presentation





Plus, the comment from Eric Bolton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MAA - confirms this aspect as well:

> As we have discussed, we historically have seen the actual delivery and leasing pressure from competing new development peak at roughly two years after the start of construction. Based on our analysis, the volume of new construction started in calendar year 2023 or two years ago dropped 39% from the peak of starts during the extraordinarily low interest rate environment in calendar year 2022, and then starts, sequentially, drop another 50% in calendar year 2024. So this is expected to result in a significant decline in actual unit deliveries starting this year and into 2026 and 2027.

Apart from the higher-for-longer context for MAA, there are obviously several REIT-specific fundamental factors that render the investment case interesting.

MAA has an upper investment grade balance sheet and net debt to EBITDA of only 3.9x, which is materially below the [sector average](https://s1.q4cdn.com/498755859/files/doc_presentations/2024/Nov/NAREIT-NOV-2024-FINAL.pdf) of 5.9x. The weighted average maturity life is 7 years, which strengthens further MAA's financial position. The FFO payout is also very conservative at 66%, which helps relax the pressure from the balance sheet in funding the new residential expansion plans. In other words, MAA is financially well-positioned to capitalize on the existing supply/demand opportunity.

Finally, we have to also appreciate the fact that MAA's properties are of a high quality and aimed at middle-class customer base, which creates easier conditions to successfully pass forward the inflation component via new rent agreements.

MAA Q3, 2024 Earnings Presentation





For example, for 2025 the plan is to divest $325 million of older real estate to maintain an up-to-date quality and the ability to increase rents.

In my view, MAA presents a great opportunity for income-oriented investors, who want to shield their investments from inflation. The current dividend of ~3.9% coupled with a robust growth potential is something that has to be definitely considered.

#2 - **Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund**
-------------------------------------------

Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund ([MSDL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL "Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund")) is a first-lien focused BDC, which lends to already established and strong cash-flowing businesses.

The reason why BDCs, in general, are decent vehicles to hold in portfolios under such market circumstances as we have now is related to the floating asset base. Most BDCs, usually, provide credit financing based on fixed spread and SOFR, which is fully correlated to the base rate levels.

In MSDL's case, almost the entire chunk of the portfolio lies in senior secured first-lien floating loans.

Yet, if we think what it practically means for the underlying businesses, we will quite quickly conclude that there is nothing positive there. Namely, higher SOFR means more expensive debt service, which, in turn, increases the credit/default risk.

In my view, MSDL is one of the few BDCs that has this risk well-mitigated.

The graph below illustrates how diversified MSDL's portfolio is. In fact, 95% of the total loan book is placed in non-cyclical industries.

[![portfolio](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/49926601-17393667319767892.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/49926601-17393667319767892_origin.jpg)



MSDL Q3, 2024 Earnings Presentation





MSDL's earnings quality is also, arguably, one of the best-in-class as less than 2% of the total income is related to PIK. The remaining share almost exclusively stems from pure cash interest income generation. The portfolio quality remains robust as well. As of Q3, 2024, the portfolio company weighted average loan-to-value was only 40%. The non-accruals on an FV basis account for only 0.2% of the total asset side.

The leverage is 0.99x, which is materially below the sector [average](https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf) of 1.17x. This in combination with well-covered base dividend provides a tangible source of cash flows for MSDL to drive the portfolio growth.

Speaking of growth, MSDL was one of the few BDCs that managed to register positive adjusted NII per share growth in Q3, 2024. This growth has been possible mostly due to consistently positive net funding volumes.

Finally, and this is very important, many BDCs actually have damaged their embedded advantage of providing strong cash flows in a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. The reason is because they have assumed below market-level borrowings, which now have to be refinanced at much higher interest rates, thereby introducing a drag on the future NII generation levels.

MSDL is not exposed to this issue. As we can see in the table below, a significant portion of external debt financing is linked to SOFR and the remaining borrowings have already somewhat similar yields to those that can be obtained in the capital market now.

MSDL Q3, 2024 Earnings Presentation





All in all, MSDL is another great high-yielding (~9.7% dividend) pick that can offer resilient income streams during periods of elevated inflation.

The Bottom Line
---------------

Currently, we have plenty of risks out there, which have one thing in common: They create (or potentially will create) an upward pressure on inflation. All of this is clearly supportive of a higher-for-longer scenario going forward.

Many asset classes will not do well, some might do fine, and some could thrive.

In this article, I discuss two income-focused securities (one from the BDC and one from the residential REIT segment) that should benefit from these kinds of market conditions.
