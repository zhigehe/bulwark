Wall Street's major market averages inched higher on Thursday as headline PPI inflation came in hotter than expected.

Early on and the benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) was +0.5%, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) was +0.9%, and the blue-chip Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) was +0.2%.

The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) fell 7 basis points to 4.55%. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) fell 3 basis points to 4.32%.

Major equity averages finished mixed on Wednesday, while yields firmly jumped as Wall Street assessed a hotter-than-anticipated monthly U.S. consumer inflation report.

"Markets saw a moderate selloff yesterday, as an upside surprise for U.S. inflation saw investors price in fewer rate cuts for the rest of the year. However, the news that the U.S. and Russia were set to start negotiations over Ukraine saw those losses pared back," Deutsche Bank's Henry Allen said.

As investors priced in higher inflation and a more hawkish Fed, U.S. Treasuries sold off sharply across the curve yesterday, Allen added

U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407064-trump-putin-agree-to-start-negotiations-immediately-over-russia-and-ukraine "Donald Trump") on Wednesday said he had a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to visit each other's countries and start negotiations to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.

"Russian President Putin will hold talks with Trump over Ukraine. Markets are not likely to overreactâ€”there is inevitable uncertainty about how long any deal would be honored. A ceasefire would not change energy flows or start reconstruction, and higher defense spending is inevitable," UBS' Paul Donovan said.

On the economic front, the headline and core PPI [came in hotter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407653-headline-core-ppi-come-in-hotter-than-expected "came in hotter") than expected in January. The PPI rose 0.4% M/M in January, surpassing the 0.3% advance expected.

Initial jobless claims dropped more than expected in the past week as well.

The Fed balance sheet will come in later in the day.
