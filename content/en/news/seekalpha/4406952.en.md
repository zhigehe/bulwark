Earnings Call Insights: Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:[BHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHF "Brighthouse Financial, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Eric Steigerwalt highlighted 2024 as a year of both achievements and challenges. He emphasized the company's progress on strategic initiatives aimed at improving capital efficiency and maintaining a combined risk-based capital ([RBC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBC "RBC Bearings Incorporated")) ratio within the target range of 400%-450% under normal market conditions.
* The company reported $10 billion in total annuity sales for 2024, with record sales of $7.7 billion from its flagship Shield annuity product suite, a 12% increase over 2023. Life insurance sales also grew 18% year-over-year to $120 million.
* Steigerwalt announced the completion of a reinsurance agreement covering a legacy block of universal life and variable universal life products, providing additional capital benefits in Q4.
* CFO Ed Spehar noted that the company contributed $100 million to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC) to maintain its estimated combined RBC ratio near 400% as of December 31, 2024. He stated, "Our financial plan currently anticipates that our combined RBC ratio will be relatively stable over the next few years without additional support from the holding company."
* Spehar also highlighted a $200 million increase in asset adequacy testing reserves related to a legacy block of fixed annuities, partially contributing to a $300 million decline in total adjusted capital ([TAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TAC "TransAlta Corporation")) during the quarter.

### Outlook

* Management reiterated its commitment to maintaining its RBC ratio within the 400%-450% range under normal markets while continuing to explore reinsurance opportunities and refine its hedging strategies.
* Regarding its legacy block of variable annuities and older Shield products, Steigerwalt indicated ongoing work to develop a hedging strategy and stated, "We are focused on managing that risk so that there is no issue for market movements and interest rate movements."
* The company expects to see additional inflows in 2025 from BlackRock's LifePath Paycheck product, which has already been implemented in six employer retirement plans.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, excluding a notable item, were $352 million, up from $243 million in Q3 2024. The favorable $48 million notable item was related to actuarial model updates.
* The annuity segment reported adjusted earnings of $327 million, driven by higher net investment income. The life segment contributed $52 million, supported by increased net investment income and underwriting margins.
* Corporate expenses declined by over 7% year-over-year for 2024, reflecting strong cost discipline.
* Holding company liquid assets stood at $1 billion pro forma for the capital contribution to BLIC.

### Q&A

* Wes Carmichael, Autonomous Research: Asked about the drivers of RBC in Q4 and the impact of strategic initiatives. CFO Ed Spehar explained that strategic initiatives, including standalone hedging for Shield new business and a reinsurance deal, provided over $400 million in benefits. However, a $200 million increase in reserves and rate-driven impacts on annuity statutory results partially offset these gains.
* Suneet Kamath, Jefferies: Questioned whether the company is considering a non-public structure due to complexity. CEO Steigerwalt affirmed the company's focus on long-term shareholder value, emphasizing its 50% reduction in shares outstanding since 2018 and continued efforts to reduce complexity.
* Ryan Krueger, KBW: Inquired about potential future reinsurance opportunities. Steigerwalt confirmed that the company is evaluating additional in-force reinsurance deals and flow reinsurance for Shield new business.
* Jimmy Bhullar, J.P. Morgan: Asked about the company's comfort level with its RBC ratio at 400%. Spehar confirmed that the company is comfortable operating at this level while continuing to unlock capital through ongoing initiatives.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism over the company's ability to reduce complexity and manage its RBC ratio effectively, with questions focusing on the challenges of hedging strategies and capital management.
* Management maintained a neutral to slightly positive tone, emphasizing progress on strategic initiatives and reiterating confidence in the company's liquidity and capital position.
* Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management showed increased focus on addressing strain from new business and improving operational efficiencies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Adjusted earnings in Q4 2024 showed a significant sequential improvement compared to Q3 2024, driven by actuarial updates and higher investment income.
* The company completed an additional reinsurance agreement in Q4, building on the fixed and payout annuities reinsurance deal announced in Q3.
* Management's tone in Q4 was more confident regarding the progress of strategic initiatives, although analysts continued to press for details on hedging and capital efficiency.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged challenges related to the impact of interest rate volatility on statutory results, noting a $350 million negative impact in Q4 from rate movements.
* Analysts raised concerns about the complexity of managing the legacy block of variable annuities and Shield products, as well as the timing of long-term free cash flow projections.
* To mitigate risks, the company is refining its hedging strategies, exploring reinsurance opportunities, and maintaining a strong liquidity position at the holding company.

### Final Takeaway

Brighthouse Financial demonstrated strong sales performance in 2024, particularly in its flagship Shield annuity and life insurance products. The company is actively addressing challenges associated with hedging complexity and statutory strain while maintaining a stable RBC ratio. Strategic initiatives, including additional reinsurance deals and ongoing cost discipline, position the company for improved capital efficiency and growth opportunities in 2025.
