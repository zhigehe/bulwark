Earnings Call Insights: P10, Inc. (NYSE:[PX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PX "P10, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Luke Sarsfield highlighted that P10 raised $1.4 billion in fee-paying AUM during Q4, bringing the 2024 total to $3.8 billion, surpassing the initial $2.5 billion guidance. He emphasized the strong momentum across private equity, credit, and venture capital strategies.
* The acquisition of Qualitas Funds, a European private equity fund of funds manager, was reiterated as a key move to enhance P10’s global footprint and expand its client base. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2025, adding approximately $1 billion in fee-paying AUM.
* CFO Amanda Coussens noted a quarterly revenue of $85 million, a 35% year-over-year increase, driven by higher contributions from direct strategies and catch-up fees from Bonaccord II.
* Coussens also confirmed that $815,327 shares were repurchased in Q4 at an average price of $12.72, with $43.5 million available for further buybacks.

### Outlook

* Management projects gross fundraising of at least $4 billion in 2025, reflecting a 60% increase over the 2024 guidance. This excludes the $1 billion in incremental fee-paying AUM expected from the Qualitas Funds acquisition.
* Revenue is anticipated to achieve double-digit growth in 2025, excluding catch-up fees, but including contributions from Qualitas Funds post-acquisition.
* FRE margins are expected to remain in the mid-40% range in 2025, with modest downward pressure due to the integration of Qualitas Funds.

### Financial Results

* Fee-paying AUM reached $25.7 billion at year-end, up 10% year-over-year, with $905 million in Q4 fundraising offset by $152 million in step-downs.
* Fully diluted adjusted net income per share for Q4 was $0.30, a 44% increase year-over-year, with full-year ANI per share reaching $1.00.
* Catch-up fees for the year totaled $38.9 million, primarily driven by Bonaccord II, which added $18.9 million in Q4.
