Chevron's (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) oil and gas reserves have fallen to their [lowest levels in at least a decade](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-struggles-replace-oil-gas-reserves-amid-hess-deal-limbo-2025-02-11/ "lowest level in at least a decade"), highlighting the importance of the company's planned acquisition of Hess' ([HES](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HES "Hess Corporation")) Guyana assets, according to a Reuters analysis published Tuesday.

Chevron’s (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) oil and gas reserves dropped more than 1B boe to 9.8B boe at the end of 2024 from 11.1B boe at the end of the prior year, although some of the decline was due to acreage sales.

At the same time, the company’s reserves replacement ratio has dropped to 45%, after hovering at ~88% over the previous 10 years, according to the analysis.

The low rate of reserve replacement raises "red flags," Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng said, highlighting investor concerns about the company's longer-term prospects.

Cheng said Chevron's ([CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) replacement ratio has been below the breakeven requirement over the past three years.

Hess' ([HES](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HES "Hess Corporation")) stake in the Guyana oilfields could help fill the gap in Chevron's ([CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) reverses, but the $53B acquisition - first announced in late 2023 - has been held up in court by Exxon Mobil, the leader of the consortium operating in Guyana.
