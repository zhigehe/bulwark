Earnings Call Insights: Camden Property Trust (NYSE:[CPT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPT "Camden Property Trust")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ric Campo highlighted Camden's strategic priorities for 2025, signaling a shift towards acquisitions and capital recycling. He outlined plans to replicate strategies from the post-financial crisis period, focusing on acquiring assets, developing new properties, and selling older apartments to optimize the portfolio's competitiveness.
* Campo emphasized significant population growth in Camden's Sunbelt markets, with Texas and Florida accounting for one-third of the U.S. population increase in 2024. This trend supports robust long-term housing demand.
* According to CFO Alex Jessett, the company reported Q4 2024 core FFO of $1.73 per share, exceeding guidance by $0.03 due to higher other income and lower operating expenses. Same-store NOI for 2024 grew 1.1%, with revenue growth at 1.3%.

### Outlook

* Management provided 2025 core FFO guidance in the range of $6.60 to $6.90 per share, with a midpoint of $6.75. This reflects a forecasted decrease compared to 2024, driven by higher interest expenses and expected flat same-store NOI.
* Projected same-store revenue growth for 2025 is set at 1%, with expense growth expected to reach 3%. Camden anticipates a modest 0% to 2% revenue growth across most markets, with better performance in top markets like Tampa, Southern California, and Washington, D.C. Metro.
* Camden plans for $750 million in acquisitions and dispositions as part of a broader initiative to rebalance the geographical distribution of its portfolio by 2027. Dispositions will target older, capital-intensive assets, while acquisitions will focus on newer properties.

### Financial Results

* Core FFO for the full year 2024 reached $6.85, with a same-store expense growth of 1.8%, primarily due to reduced property taxes and insurance costs. Camden's balance sheet remains robust, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.8x.
* Q4 2024 saw blended lease trade-outs at negative 1.2%, with new leases down 4.7% and renewals up 3.2%. Occupancy averaged 95.5% for the quarter.
* Camden completed construction on two developments in Q4 2024 and acquired a suburban Austin property for $68 million at a stabilized yield of 5%.

### Q&A

* Jamie Feldman, Wells Fargo: Questioned expectations for lease growth trends in 2025. CFO Jessett responded that blended lease growth is expected at 1% to 2%, with new lease rates turning positive in the third quarter.
* Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets: Asked about signs of supply impact fading. Jessett highlighted improving signed new lease trends in Q4 2024 and January 2025 as evidence of recovery.
* Sanket Agrawal, Evercore ISI: Inquired about $750 million transaction guidance. CEO Campo discussed improving transaction volume due to narrowing price gaps between buyers and sellers.
* Eric Wolfe, Citi: Asked about front-loaded acquisition strategy. Jessett explained acquisitions will precede dispositions to maximize tax efficiency through reverse 10/31 exchanges.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts displayed cautious optimism, with many questions focused on supply-demand dynamics and the expected recovery in lease rates. Concerns centered on elevated supply in certain markets and interest expense impacts.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly in prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic opportunities and market resilience. However, they acknowledged ongoing challenges in markets like Austin and Nashville.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts showed increased interest in transaction activity, while management demonstrated heightened confidence in 2025's strategic direction.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted towards a more detailed strategic plan for acquisitions and dispositions, compared to the broader focus on operational metrics in Q3 2024.
* Same-store revenue growth projections for 2025 are lower than expectations for 2024, reflecting ongoing supply pressures in certain markets.
* Analysts' focus shifted from insurance cost savings in Q3 to broader transaction opportunities and market-level performance in Q4.
* Management's tone was slightly more confident in Q4, with a clear emphasis on long-term portfolio optimization and market rebalancing.

### Risks and Concerns

* Elevated supply in markets like Austin and Nashville remains a challenge, with revenue in these areas expected to decline by up to 3% in 2025. Management remains cautiously optimistic about recovery by year-end.
* Rising interest expenses and potential headwinds from economic uncertainties could pressure financial performance.
* Analysts also raised concerns about the timing and execution of planned acquisitions and dispositions.

### Final Takeaway
