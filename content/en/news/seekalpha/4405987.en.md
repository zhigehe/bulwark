Oil prices jumped on Tuesday, building on the previous day's gains amid worries over tighter Russian oil supply, while lingering tariff fears kept prices in check.

Brent crude futures ([CO1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM "Brent Futures")) were up +1.38% to $76.92 a barrel by 6 am ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) rose +1.22% to $73.20. Both contracts posted gains of nearly 2% in the prior session after three weekly losses in a row.

Reports showed Russian production fell further below its OPEC+ quota in January, while new U.S. sanctions targeted individuals and tankers transporting Iranian crude to China.

Meanwhile, on the geopolitical front, President Trump said he would give Hamas until noon Saturday to release all Israeli hostages, raising the threat of renewed conflict in the region.

Looking at metals, CreditSights said Tuesday, "the rationale for  [aluminum tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405874-trump-signs-order-imposing-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum " aluminum tariffs ") is less clear since it's a less prominent sector in the U.S., while higher tariffs will lead AA to redirect its Canadian aluminum to European markets."

"The steel industry seems to be becoming quasi-government-owned, with the Nippon/US steel deal being blocked for national security reasons and now the imposition of blanket tariffs," the brokerage said.

With rising steel prices and the Federal Reserve being less likely to cut rates, a key question is "whether this will affect demand from rate-sensitive end markets like construction and autos."

Steel makers like Cleveland-Cliffs ([CLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLF "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.")) with operations in Canada and Mexico could benefit from tariffs, as rising steel prices may offset increased costs, it added.

ETFs in the metals and mining sector surged Monday after President Trump said the U.S. will impose new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, on top of existing metals duties. ETF: (NYSEARCA:[SLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLX "VanEck Steel ETF"))

Elsewhere, a pilot program in China that allows insurers to buy gold for the first time could free up billions of dollars of investment in the metal, adding further impetus to a [record-setting rally,](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405459-commodity-roundup-gold-prices-hit-record-high-as-trump-announces-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminium "record-setting rally,") [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/china-frees-possible-27-billion-from-insurers-to-invest-in-gold "Bloomberg reported"). 

Ten insurance firms — including PICC Property & Casualty Co. and China Life Insurance Co., two of China’s biggest — will be able to invest as much as 1% of their assets in bullion, in a program that became effective last Friday. That would translate into a potential 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) of funds, Minsheng Securities Co. said in a note.
