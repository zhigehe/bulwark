Stock index futures slipped on Tuesday as President Donald Trump signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.

S&P 500 futures ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) -0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures ([US100:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US100:IND "NASDAQ 100 Futures")) -0.4%, and Dow futures ([INDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDU "Dow Jones Futures")) -0.1%.

The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) rose 2 basis points to 4.52%. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) was flat at 4.29%.

Wall Street's major averages concluded trading on Monday in positive territory, as investors now look ahead towards Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's testimony and key inflation data that is slated to be released later in the week.

"The tariff news has continued to build over the last 24 hours, but risk assets got the week off to a solid start yesterday," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.

Trump [signed the executive orders](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405874-trump-signs-order-imposing-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum "signed the executive orders") after-hours Monday imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., canceling all exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries.

"Our U.S. economists published a piece suggesting that if sustained, steel and aluminum tariffs combined with reciprocal tariffs could increase core PCE in 2025 by an additional 30-40bps, depending on the ultimate passthrough to consumer prices," Reid added.

"Trump stated there will be no exceptions to aggressively taxing US buyers of foreign metals. If there is no retreat, this will reduce U.S. steel consumersâ€™ competitiveness via higher import and domestic costs. Retail consumers are less likely to notice the tax unless job losses are explicitly linked to it," UBS' Paul Donovan said. 

Traders will also be keen to hear Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee later in the day.
