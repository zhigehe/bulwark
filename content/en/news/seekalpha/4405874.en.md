President Trump signed the executive orders after-hours Monday imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., canceling all exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries.

The prooclamations signed at the White House were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers.

"This is the beginning of making America rich again," Trump said in the Oval Office, as he signed dual executive orders for steel and aluminum tariffs. "No exceptions, no nothing," Trump added.

The president also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S.

Trump also has so far imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in addition to previous tariffs, and threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico before reaching short-term deals with their governments.
