As Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) explores the [robot market](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4139957-apple-moves-forward-with-tabletop-robot-report "robot market") to boost sales, a widely watched analyst believes the tech giant is exploring both the humanoid and non-humanoid markets alike.

"Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots for its future smart home ecosystem, and these products are still in the early proof-of-concept stage internally," TF International Securities' analyst Ming-Chi Kuo [said](https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342 "said") on X. "While the industry debates the merits of humanoid vs. non-humanoid designs, supply chain checks indicate Apple cares more about how users build perception with robots than their physical appearance (so Apple uses anthropomorphic instead of humanoid), implying sensing hardware and software serve as the core technologies."

The launch of an Apple-branded robot, which could be its ["next big thing,"](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4086985-apple-said-to-look-at-personal-robots-for-next-big-thing-report "\"next big thing,\"") is unlikely to occur anytime soon, Kuo added. Citing current progress and the typical development cycles, mass production of a robot likely will not start until at least 2028, if not later.

In addition, Apple has been "unusually open" about sharing some of its robotics research in recent memory, Kuo said. This includes a [research paper](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement "research paper") published last month that described a robot that looks similar to the lamp at the start of Pixar movies. (Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the CEO of Pixar before he sold it to Disney ([DIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS "The Walt Disney Company")) in 2006).

The company is also [said](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4139957-apple-moves-forward-with-tabletop-robot-report "said") to be working on a smart home tabletop robot that has an iPad-like display and a robotic arm.
