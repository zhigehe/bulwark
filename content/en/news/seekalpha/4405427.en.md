President Donald Trump on Sunday said the U.S. may be carrying less debt than previously believed, adding that it could be due to fraud related to payments to the debt, according to media reports.

Trump reportedly made the comments to reporters on Air Force One en route to New Orleans for the Super Bowl. 

[Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-09/trump-suggests-musk-found-irregularities-in-us-treasuries?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczOTEzOTY3NiwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NzQ0NDc2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkZRNFlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIyQTIyNzNDMjg0QkQ0Q0I2OEVBNTIwMjg0MkEwMkE1NCJ9.xFHWt40sPXrHJNamt7xg65APJaRxmVLZWMPdKksvKGU) that Trump suggested the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk has found irregularities with U.S. Treasuries. He said some of the debt may be disregarded, but didn’t say what may be discarded.

“We may have less debt than we thought,” Trump was quoted as saying.

DOGE has been investigating the Treasury Department, but a federal judge has limited the private information it can access.

The U.S. Treasury says the country has $36.2T in debt outstanding.
