The Alpha Architect 1-3 Month Box ETF (BATS:[BOXX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOXX "Alpha Architect 1-3 Month Box ETF")) and the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:[MUB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MUB "iShares National Muni Bond ETF")) are very different funds. One focuses on simple muni bonds, the other runs a complicated options strategy with effectively the same risk-return profile as t-bills. The risks, returns, and dividends offered by these funds are very different, but they do have one key similarity: income and returns are tax-advantaged. As this is an important, and rare, characteristic, thought to write a comparison piece for these ETFs.

MUB is a simple muni bond ETF. It has a 3.0% dividend yield, 3.4% SEC yield. Dividends are exempt from federal income taxes. Credit risk is low, rate risk and overall volatility both moderate. After-tax income seems low *for most investors*, at least relative to investment-grade bonds and the like.

BOXX achieves effectively identical returns as t-bills. Income is almost always retained within the fund, allowing investors to defer their taxes. It has expected returns of around 4.4% *right now*, but this number would decline if the Fed continues to cut rates. Overall risk and volatility are extremely low, risk-adjusted returns high. BOXX's tax advantages seem weaker compared to MUB, to me at least.

In my opinion, BOXX is the overall stronger choice due to higher risk-adjusted returns. MUB's tax advantages seem stronger, so it might be preferable to some, perhaps many, investors.

BOXX versus MUB: Comparison
---------------------------

#### Strategy and Holdings

MUB is a simple index ETF investing in investment-grade muni bonds, offering broad-based, diversified exposure to these securities.

BOXX is a more complicated fund, using options to achieve returns effectively identical to those of t-bills. In theory, and practice.

Considering the above, an investment in BOXX has similar implications as an investment in t-bills.

BOXX has a longer, more in-depth explanation of its strategy [here](https://alphaarchitect.com/2023/05/box-spreads-an-alternative-to-treasury-bills/), I have my own [here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4635166-boxx-cash-alternative-etf-5-8-percent-options-yield).

#### Potential Tax Benefits - MUB Tentative Winner

The (potential) tax benefits of each fund are very different.

MUB's dividends are exempt from federal income taxes, a significant, straightforward benefit for investors.

BOXX's strategy allows the fund to retain a significant portion of its income within itself. This means few, if any, distributions, allowing investors to defer taxes until a moment of their choosing. Investors might be able to time their sales so as to minimize their tax burden, depending on their circumstances.

BOXX's options are generally classified as 1256 contracts, which are taxed 60% at long-term capital gains rates, 40% short-term. Long-term capital gain tax rates should be lower than income tax rates for most investors, although obviously circumstances vary.

MUB's tax benefits seem highly certain. Muni bonds *are* exempt from federal income taxes, and although the situation *could* always change, it seems pretty clear right now.

BOXX's tax benefits are somewhat uncertain, however. Its strategy does not *necessarily* result in retaining income within the fund / being able to defer taxes. Operational issues could result in taxable events, and did result in BOXX paying one distribution this past August. BOXX's strategy *mostly* works, but not 100%. Being able to *defer* taxes does not *necessarily* result in a diminished tax burden, either: perhaps investors simply never have a good time to sell.

Overall, MUB's tax benefits seem *better* than BOXX's, being stronger and more certain. As these issues are ultimately dependent on the specific circumstances of each investor, I'm sure there are many exceptions.

Calling MUB the *tentative* winner in this area seems appropriate.

#### Credit Risk - BOXX Winner

MUB focuses on AA-rated muni bonds, with sizable investments in those rated AAA and A.

MUB





MUB's credit quality is quite high, which *should* ensure small, short-lived losses during downturns and recessions. MUB suffered a double-digit drawdown during the pandemic, much higher than expected for a fund with its credit quality. I've noticed similar losses in other muni bond ETFs. Liquidity issues and overall market bearishness seem the likeliest culprits. Losses lasted for a few months, with the fund recovering from these in June.

Data by YCharts





BOXX's credit quality is a bit more complicated. T-bills have effectively zero credit risk, barring an unprecedented U.S. default. BOXX is basically a synthetic t-bills ETF, so should see effectively zero losses during downturns and recessions, same as t-bills. I could see tiny, short-lived losses during periods of market stress, but even that seems unlikely.

For reference, drawdowns for BOXX, MUNI, and t-bill ETFs.

Data by YCharts





BOXX's option strategy suffers from counterparty risk. Said options are bought through / guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which has an AA credit rating, and which is considered a systematically important financial institution by the government.

In my opinion, and for all intents and purposes, BOXX's credit risk is significantly lower than that of MUB.

#### **Interest Rate Risk - BOXX Clear Winner**

MUB's muni bonds have an average duration of 6.3 years, in-line with broader bond benchmarks.

BOXX's option strategy does not have material market or rate risk, so the fund's duration is effectively zero (same as t-bills). I'm not sure that duration is the appropriate word when discussing these issues for an options ETF, but it is definitely the simplest.

MUB's interest rate risk is significantly higher than that of BOXX. Expect significantly higher capital losses / declining share prices for MUB when interest rates increase. MUB's share price is down 8.8% since early 2022, when the Fed started to hike. Results are a bit better than expected, but not significantly so.

Data by YCharts



BOXX was created in late 2022, so missed most of the turmoil caused by Fed hikes. Still, I'm quite confident that the fund's share price would have remained stable during 2022, and during any future hiking cycle. Prices have *increased* since inception, due to retaining income, with the hiking cycle having no measurable impact on the fund's share price.

Data by YCharts



Flip side of the above is that MUB might see higher capital gains when interest rates decrease. Considering current market conditions and guidance, there is no guarantee that the Fed will cut rates, nor is there any guarantee that these would lead to capital gains for MUB. The Federal Reserve cut rates in 2024 and MUB's share price *declined*, for instance.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_2d39f55e7784a98cf5c9f17632643a79.png)

Data by YCharts



In my opinion, and considering the above, MUB's share price will *not* significantly increase in the coming months. I do expect bond prices to recover from prior losses, at maturity if not earlier, but this should not result in *significant* gains.

In my opinion, BOXX's lower duration is a net advantage vis a vis MUB, as it decreases overall volatility. More dovish investors, or those wishing to trade on higher bond prices, might disagree.

#### Overall Volatility - BOXX Clear Winner

BOXX's overall volatility is extremely low, in-line with t-bills. MUB's volatility is below-average, in-line with its moderate duration and high-quality portfolio. Volatility is as follows, I've included ETFs tracking other bond sub-asset classes for reference:

Data by YCharts



Comparing their returns shows a similar pattern. BOXX is a straight line, MUB does fluctuate somewhat.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_0a4d2c8da4f8ffaf7a52f7b21794062b.png)

Data by YCharts



BOXX's incredibly safe, stable share price and returns are a significant benefit for shareholders, and an advantage relative to MUB. BOXX is appropriate for cash investors, or those looking to minimize risk as much as possible. MUB is appropriate for risk-averse investors too, but there is *some* risk and volatility here, and definitely an inappropriate investment for cash investors.

#### Yield Analysis - MUB Tentative Winner

MUB sports a 3.0% dividend yield, 3.4% SEC yield. Standardized SEC yields seem the more appropriate figure for MUB, considering heightened rate volatility in prior years.

 [![MUB](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/48557980-1739389635727805.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/48557980-1739389635727805_origin.png) 



MUB





BOXX sports a 0.3% dividend yield, from its one dividend payment. Expected returns should be effectively identical to t-bill rates, which currently stand at 4.3%.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_0682c6e0767f22c2da1f7b89a637b17b.png)

Data by YCharts



BOXX's 4.3% yield is higher than MUB's 3.4% SEC yield. Expected returns are higher for the former, with BOXX outperforming MUB since inception, as expected.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_8bad1750f3f45589427e5b6a2f4d3bb3.png)

Data by YCharts



After-tax income for these funds depends on the circumstances of each specific investor. By my calculations, there is a breakeven tax rate of 21%: BOXX provides higher after-tax income for investors facing lower rates than 21%, MUB higher for those facing higher rates. Assuming investors don't sell, that is. For reference, long-term capital gain taxes cap out at 20%, short-term at 37%.

Further Federal Reserve cuts would immediately decrease t-bill rates, and BOXX's expected returns. MUB's dividends would not be immediately affected by these, perhaps in a couple of years.

Overall, MUB does seem to provide higher after-tax income to most investors, at least in the medium and long-term. At least some investors might get more out of BOXX's tax deferment, though, even though long-term income seems almost certain to be lower. MUB seems like the tentative winner in this section but interested in reading what others think.

#### Risk-Adjusted Yield and Returns - BOXX Clear Winner

BOXX has outperformed MUB since inception:

At significantly lower volatility:

Data by YCharts



Due to the above, BOXX's risk-adjusted returns and yield are both significantly stronger than those of MUB. Federal Reserve cuts would *narrow* this gap, but are unlikely to completely close it, under current guidance at least.

MUB's overall [risk-adjusted yield and returns seem quite weak](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657986-mub-municipal-bond-index-etf-no-compelling-investment-thesis) relative to most other bond sub-asset classes. MUB's tax-advantaged 3.0% yield provides the same post-tax income as a 4.6% taxable yield *for investors in the highest tax bracket*. Benchmark investment-grade ETFs yield around 4.3%, providing slightly less after-tax income than MUB. Lots of investment-grade ETFs have higher dividend yields than this, including the Janus Henderson B-BBB CLO ETF ([JBBB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JBBB "Janus Detroit Street Trust - Janus Henderson B-BBB CLO ETF")) and the Angel Oak Income ETF ([CARY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CARY "Angel Oak Income ETF")).

Data by YCharts



In my opinion, and considering the above, BOXX has a clear investment thesis and target market, while MUB does not. Few reasons to pick MUB over CARY, as the latter provides higher after-tax income and is less volatile. Some reasons to pick BOXX over CARY, with the former being much less volatile, and providing higher after-tax income right now.

BOXX seems particularly interesting for investors looking for tax-advantaged cash or ultra short-term investments. MUB *could* be of interest for longer-term investors looking for high-quality, tax-advantaged investments, but there are simply better, albeit taxable, choices in this space. As the tax advantages of these ETFs are dependent on the specific circumstances of each investor, I imagine MUB might be of interest to *some* investors, but probably not many.

Investors could achieve stronger risk-return profiles with a combination of BOXX and the VanEck High Yield Muni ETF ([HYD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HYD "VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck High Yield Muni ETF")). BOXX is lower-risk, lower-return than MUB, HYD the opposite. A simple 50% BOXX / 50% HYD allocation has a higher yield, lower volatility than MUB:

Cuts of 2.5% would narrow the gap above, but not fully close it. The market currently expects [one rate cut this year](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407027-only-one-fed-rate-cut-expected-in-2025-after-hot-january-inflation-data), a far cry from 2.5%.

Seeking Alpha - Table by Author





Both BOXX and HYD have outperformed MUB since inception. I expect HYD will continue to outperform, due to its higher yields. BOXX's outperformance is highly uncertain, but short-term outperformance seems likelier than not, as t-bill yields remain elevated.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_69c6350ed7004bfbc03ab2cfbfaff737.png)

Data by YCharts



MUB does have *some* benefits and advantages, but its overall risk-return profile and investment thesis seems weak. Investors can achieve higher income and stronger returns through combining better overall funds, including BOXX and HYD.

Conclusion
----------

MUB and BOXX both offer investors tax-advantaged income and returns. BOXX's overall investment thesis and risk-adjusted returns seem stronger and is my preferred choice.
