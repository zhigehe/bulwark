Stock index futures traded in the green on Monday, as investors looked forward to key economic data set to be released this week and assessed President Donald Trump's plans to impose fresh tariffs.

S&P 500 futures ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) +0.5%, Nasdaq 100 futures ([US100:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US100:IND "NASDAQ 100 Futures")) +0.7%, and Dow futures ([INDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDU "Dow Jones Futures")) +0.3%.

The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) was unchanged at 4.50%. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) was flat at 4.30%.

U.S. stocks closed in the red Friday, turning lower after a surge in consumers' inflation expectations, then falling further on a report that Trump was planning reciprocal tariffs.

[Trump](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405425 "Trump") said Sunday that he will announce a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports on Monday. The tariffs would apply to all countries.

The tariff news will clearly continue to dominate the agenda all week, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.

"Taxing steel and aluminum is less visible to end consumers. Taxing (bulk) imports from China is also less visible. Trade taxes in these areas are likely to be more enduring. They are still economically negative, but there are potentially fewer second-round effects," UBS' Paul Donovan said.

Traders were also looking forward to a macroeconomic data-heavy week, with the January retail inflation report on Wednesday and the wholesale inflation data on Thursday.

"The week after payrolls is usually quiet, but due to the first Friday of the month being the latest it could possibly be this month, then we bump straight into U.S. CPI in the week, with PPI on Thursday for an added bit of inflationary sparkle," Reid said.

While there are no major economic events scheduled for today, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee will take place on Tuesday.
