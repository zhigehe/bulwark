The changing narratives around U.S. tariffs on imported goods are causing “whipsawing moves” in the U.S. dollar and driving its short-term price trend lower, said Chintan Kotecha, senior equity derivatives research analyst at BofA, in a note.

According to BofA, analysts are still long the dollar with meaningful positions vs. the euro ([USD:EUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:EUR "US Dollar / Euro")), the Australian dollar ([USD:AUD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:AUD "US Dollar / Australian Dollar")), the Canadian dollar ([USD:CAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CAD "US Dollar / Canadian Dollar")), and the Mexican peso ([USD:MXN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:MXN "US Dollar / Mexican Peso")).

“But the declining price trend could see CTAs (commodity trading advisors) partially unwinding U.S. dollar longs in the near-term,” said Kotecha. “Notably, heightened volatility on these rapid, tariff induced foreign exchange moves also lends itself to trend follower positioning unwinds.”

This was seen in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar ([USD:CAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CAD "US Dollar / Canadian Dollar")) this week. The index is down about 0.22% over the past five days.

In addition, larger unwinds could come on the U.S. dollar sell triggers, Kotecha said. The U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar’s ([USD:CAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CAD "US Dollar / Canadian Dollar")) trigger is the closest at 90 basis points away, currently.

Here are BofA’s Trend Following Model Positions and their five-day projections:

* ([EUR:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUR:USD "Euro / US Dollar")) – Model CTA position: short; Trend strength: -56%; Five-day median projection: -47%
