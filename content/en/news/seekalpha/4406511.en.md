Home improvement and service platform Angi (NASDAQ:[ANGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANGI "Angi Inc.")) broke even in the fourth quarter from a loss of a penny a year earlier, giving shares a lift in after-hours trading after a four-day losing streak during the regular session.

Revenue generated from ads and leads fell 13% from a year ago, while services revenue was down 5%, resulting in a 12% decline in domestic revenue. International revenue improved by 5%, leading to a consolidated decline of 11% in total revenue to $267.9M, missing the consensus estimate by $13M. Adjusted EBITDA fell 23% to $32M driven primarily by the recovery in Q4 2023 of $11M of previously incurred legal fees.

The company also said there were 16% fewer service requests in the fourth quarter, 4% fewer monetized transactions, but a 14% increase in monetized transactions per service request.

Within each segment, Ads and Leadsâ€™ operating income increased 21% to $28.7M reflecting lower consumer marketing expenses on improved efficiencies and lower sales-related expenses, partially offset by 13% lower revenue and a $10.9M benefit from insurance coverage for previously incurred legal fees.

Operating loss for its Services segment swelled by 268% to ($7.1M) on lower revenue, higher amortization of intangibles, and $3.4M lower depreciation tied to capitalized software assets.

For the current quarter, Angi (NASDAQ:[ANGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANGI "Angi Inc.")) expects operating income to break even and adjusted EBITDA to decrease to $20M versus $2M and $32M in Q4, respectively. For all of 2025, operating income is seen reaching $25M to $60M and adjusted EBITDA of $135M to $150M compared to $145M in 2024.

Additionally, last month IAC Inc. ([IAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAC "IAC Inc.")) announced its Board of Directors approved a plan to spin off IAC's full stake in Angi (NASDAQ:[ANGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANGI "Angi Inc.")) to IAC shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025 but no sooner than March 31, 2025.
