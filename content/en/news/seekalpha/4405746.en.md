Flutter Entertainment’s (NYSE:[FLUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT "Flutter Entertainment plc")) FanDuel realized a 19% increase in the number of bets placed on the winner of Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, setting a record of 16.6M bets placed across ~3M active users.

Besides bets on the outcome of the game, FanDuel also let users bet on which Manning brother, Eli or Peyton, would kick a football through a field goal.

The two brothers went head-to-head in a live field goal competition during the Super Bowl pregame show, “Kick of Destiny 3,” with former Giant’s quarterback Eli Manning making the winning kick. FanDuel customers were able to make a free pick, after which those who placed their bets for Eli won an equal share of $10M in Bonus Bets, translating into $10 in Bonus Bets on the platform.

At its peak betting time, customer activity amounted to ~70K bets per minute.

Of the bets placed on the game, 83% were for the game’s total points to exceed 48.5 points, whether Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy would get over or under 5.5 rushing yards, and if Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert was over or under 52.5 receiving yards. Ninety-nine percent of all bettors took the over on both.

According to data from the American Gaming Association, legal bets placed on Super Bowl LIV were expected to reach nearly $1.4B, up 18.4% from last year’s Super Bowl with the majority of bets placed on either FanDuel (NYSE:[FLUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT "Flutter Entertainment plc")) or DraftKings ([DKNG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKNG "DraftKings Inc.")).
