Gerdau (NYSE:[GGB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GGB)) +5.6% in Monday's trading after President Trump said he planned to announce [25% tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405527-steel-aluminum-stocks-jump-as-trump-to-set-25-percent-tariffs) on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S.

Gerdau (NYSE:[GGB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GGB "Gerdau S.A.")) has units in the U.S. and previously touted its substantial operations there as a hedge against the risk of protectionism from Trump.

"Gerdau is typically seen as a key beneficiary in this context," BTG Pactual analysts [said](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/shares-brazils-gerdau-rise-after-trumps-steel-tariff-plans-2025-02-10/), although steel fundamentals in the U.S. are under pressure in the short term, so while the stock's initial jump "may be to cover shorts or look for a quick trade, we recommend some caution."

Brazil steel producing peer Companhia Siderurgica Nacional ([SID](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SID "Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional")), which is more exposed to the Brazilian market, recently traded +1.2% in an overall positive session for Brazilian equities; iron ore miner Vale ([VALE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE "Vale S.A.")) +0.9%.

Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam are the biggest sellers of steel into the U.S., according to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute; Brazil exported $6.1B of iron and steel in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for 41% of the exports, making it Brazil's largest buyer of iron and steel.
