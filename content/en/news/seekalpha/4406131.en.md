RV-manufacturer LCI Industries (NYSE:[LCII](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCII "LCI Industries")) swung to a profit in the fourth quarter on cost-saving initiatives, but sales were down by 4% during the quarter and by 1% for all of 2024 as [high financing costs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4393444-financing-costs-remain-a-drag-on-leisure-vehicle-category-analyst "high financing costs") shifted demand from pricey motorhomes to less expensive single-axle travel trailers.

“[LCI Industries] demonstrated continued market leadership and resilience in 2024, leveraging cost savings and operational improvements to increase EBITDA by $89 million over 2023. This performance came despite a challenging RV and marine industry backdrop,” said CEO Jason Lippert, adding that the company is seeing modest improvement in the RV market in 2025 with consolidated sales up 6% in January amid growing optimism from customers.

Accordingly, Lippert said LCI Industries (NYSE:[LCII](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCII "LCI Industries")) is on track to achieve $5B in net sales by 2027 and a return to double-digit operating margins.

[For Q4](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406025-lci-gaap-eps-of-0_37-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-803m-beats-by-2_17m "For Q4"), consolidated net sales of $803.1M were down 4% from a year ago but $2.2M better than analysts expected. A 6% cut in cost of sales during the quarter contributed to net income of $0.37 per share versus a loss of $0.09 a year ago, 8 cents above [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCII/earnings "expectations"). Q4 EBITDA increased to $45.8M from $35.6M last year.

By category, demand for travel trailers and fifth wheels increased 0.6% while motorhome sales were down 24%. In the company’s aftermarket segment, sales increased 1.2%, all of which contributed to a 4% drop in total sale. At the same time, profits swelled in its OEM segment to $1.86M from a loss of $11.7M, resulting in a 5-fold increase in operating profits.

Competitors Thor Industries ([THO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THO "THOR Industries, Inc.")) and Winnebago ([WGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WGO "Winnebago Industries, Inc.")) both swung to a loss in Q4.

LCI Industries (NYSE:[LCII](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCII "LCI Industries")) opened on Tuesday with a gain of 5%.
