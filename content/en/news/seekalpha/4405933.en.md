Baidu's (NASDAQ:[BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU "Baidu, Inc.")) CEO Robin Li said investment in data centers and cloud infrastructure is still required in spite of the cost efficiency shown by DeepSeek ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) compared to the large AI models, Reuters reported.

"The investment in cloud infrastructure is still very much required. In order to come up with models that are smarter than everyone else, you have to use more compute," said Li at the World Government Summit in Dubai, according to the [report](https://www.reuters.com/technology/baidu-ceo-says-more-ai-spend-still-needed-despite-deepseeks-success-2025-02-11/ "report").

Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

Chinese internet search giant Baidu was among the first companies in China to launch its AI service in 2023 after Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation"))-backed OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022. In November 2024, Li noted that the company's AI capabilities are [gaining](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4315400-baidu-dips-after-q3-online-marketing-revenue-disappoints-but-cloud-business-picks-up "gaining") broader market recognition, due to the increasing adoption of its AI model Ernie. Earlier this month, domestic AI rival Alibaba ([BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) released a new family of AI models called Qwen2.5-VL.

Compute, or Computational power, enables AI models to process large amounts of data, perform complex calculations and generate predictions.

On Tuesday, Li noted that DeepSeek's sudden emergence showed the unpredictable nature of innovation. "You just don't know when and where innovations come from," said Li.

Li also said that U.S. chip curbs have forced Chinese companies to innovate within computing constraints. In addition, Li seemed to soften his stance on closed-source development, and noted that open-source approaches could speed up AI adoption, the report added.

"If you open things up, a lot of people will be curious enough to try it. This will help spread the technology much faster," said Li as per the report.

U.S. tech stocks [plunged](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399000-nvidia-broadcom-lead-tech-stocks-lower-amid-deepseek-ai-impact#hasComeFromMpArticle "plunged") on Jan. 27, after DeepSeek last month [unveiled](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398699-chinese-ai-lab-deepseek-rattles-silicon-valley#hasComeFromMpArticle "unveiled") its AI model R1 and detailed in a paper how large language models, or LLMs, could be built on tight budgets and improved without human supervision. Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) saw around $589B in market cap [erased](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399188-nvidia-rebounds-after-record-589b-market-cap-rout#hasComeFromMpArticle "erased") on Jan. 27.

However, U.S. tech giants have been undeterred and plan to build their AI infrastructure further. Companies, including Alphabet's ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) Google, Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), Meta Platforms ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) and Microsoft have already [spent](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405172-google-amazon-plan-billions-in-capex-for-ai-undeterred-by-deepseek-moment "spent") billions in their last quarters, and plan a similar approach for 2025.
