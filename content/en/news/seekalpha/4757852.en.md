Investment environment
----------------------

* European equity markets were unsettled during the period – first, in October, by the extent and potential repercussions of the emerging Chinese stimulus measures, and then by the third-quarter reporting season when corporates reported results that largely reflected the subdued economic developments observed in summer 2024.
* European equities fell in November after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential win and his vow to implement trade tariffs that could hurt Europe’s economy. U.S. markets, on the other hand, surged ahead.
* In December, the subdued performance of European shares was affected by the hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), which were interpreted as an indication that the Fed could make fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than previously expected. This interpretation translated to yields moving higher on both sides of the Atlantic, with U.S. 10-year yields rising from 3.8% to 4.6% and German 10-year yields rising from 2.1% to 2.4%.
* Against this backdrop, value stocks outperformed growth stocks by 2.5%. Travel and leisure, banks, and media outperformed at the sector level, while real estate, chemicals, and basic resources underperformed.

Portfolio review
----------------

Austrian bank Erste Bank ([OTCPK:EBKOF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKOF "Erste Group Bank AG"))([OTCPK:EBKDY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKDY "Erste Group Bank AG")) was the portfolio’s top relative contributor over the quarter. The bank reported strong third-quarter results and benefited from the positive sentiment around the banking sector, with the expectation of “higher- for-longer” interest rates after the Fed’s hawkish December meeting boosting its share price.

Danish jewelry company Pandora ([OTCPK:PNDZF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PNDZF "Pandora A/S"))([OTCPK:PNDRY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PNDRY "Pandora A/S")) also contributed on a relative basis, benefiting from solid third-quarter results and its over-proportional exposure to the U.S. At quarter-end, the company’s share price was bolstered by a pullback in silver prices, which is a key input cost for Pandora. Another relative contributor was the Belgian-Dutch biotechnology company Argenx ([ARGX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGX "argenx SE"))([OTCPK:ARGNF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGNF "argenx SE")), which released a strong earnings report in late October. The company’s share price was further boosted by a positive phase II readout for its key drug VYVGART.

Detractors from relative performance included the semiconductor capital equipment company ASML ([ASML](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML "ASML Holding N.V.")), which reported poor results during the period, undershooting the market’s expectations. We closed our position during the period. In the same context, vacuum valve company VAT Group ([OTCPK:VACNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VACNY "VAT Group AG"))([OTCPK:VTTGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTTGF "VAT Group AG")) suffered from the broadly weak results posted in the semiconductor equipment space.

The dental implant company Straumann ([OTCPK:SAUHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAUHF "Straumann Holding AG"))([OTCPK:SAUHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAUHY "Straumann Holding AG")) posted solid overall numbers in the quarter, but its growth in the U.S. market came in behind expectations. The above-mentioned increase in yields also did not help the company’s performance, as consumer access to affordable credit is key to the company’s return to higher growth levels in the U.S.

Manager outlook
---------------

We believe that three of the main hurdles preventing more supportive economic conditions over the past two years are now on the cusp of turning around. The first was destocking, which became an issue in the aftermath of the pandemic but now appears to have run its course in most industries. The second was restrictive monetary policies, implemented to fight inflation, that now are starting to turn into monetary easing. The third was the long hesitation of Chinese authorities to stimulate the Chinese economy, which they now are starting to do, having perhaps at last reached their pain threshold.

Furthermore, we believe various potential catalysts are forming that could begin to lift the gloom hanging over European markets. These include a Ukrainian ceasefire, political change in Germany, growth acceleration in the U.S. providing support for European companies with a large U.S. presence, and a troughing of European purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs). We may not have a crystal ball, but progress in one or more of these areas could potentially lead to a positive reaction in the European equity market.

While we acknowledge the uncertainties around the exact shape of President Trump’s initial policies and the potentially flatter interest rate trajectory versus previous expectations (with the market anticipating that the easing cycle may have been short-lived, especially in the U.S.), we are confident on several opportunities in European equity markets.

Consistent with our core approach, the portfolio is set up in a balanced way in terms of stylistic factors and sector exposures, making relative performance independent of a specific macroeconomic development.

Monetary policy refers to the policies of a central bank, aimed at influencing the level of inflation and growth in an economy. It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. Volatility measures risk using the dispersion of returns for a given investment.  Please consider the charges, risks, expenses and investment objectives carefully before investing. For a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this and other information, please call Janus Henderson at 800.668.0434 or download the file from [Products - US Advisor](https://janushenderson.com/info). Read it carefully before you invest or send money.  Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Discussion is based on the performance of Class I Shares.

The comments should not be construed as a recommendation of individual holdings or market sectors, but as an illustration of broader themes.  Mutual fund performance for some periods may incorporate returns from older share classes, adjusted for fees and expenses. Visit [janushenderson.com/synthetic](https://janushenderson.com/synthetic) for specific details. Holdings are subject to change without notice.  For equity portfolios, relative contribution compares the performance of a security in the portfolio to the benchmark’s total return, factoring in the difference in weight of that security in the benchmark. Returns are calculated using daily returns and previous day ending weights rolled up by ticker, gross of advisory fees, may exclude certain derivatives and does not represent actual performance.  **There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.**  **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Foreign securities are subject to** additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  **Concentrated investments** in a single sector, industry or region will be more susceptible to factors affecting that group and may be more volatile than less concentrated investments or the market as a whole.  **Increased** **portfolio** **turnover** may result in higher expenses and potentially higher net taxable gains or losses.
