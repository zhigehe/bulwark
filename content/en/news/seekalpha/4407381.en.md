* Total net revenues for 2024 reached €5.8 billion, exceeding guidance of €5.6 billion. Net revenues (excluding treasury results) grew 8% organically to €4.8 billion, while EBITDA (excluding treasury results) rose 14% to €2.3 billion.
* The Investment Management Solutions (IMS) segment saw significant progress, achieving €608 million in annual recurring revenue ([ARR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARR "ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.")), representing a 17% increase driven by SaaS transformation and client expansion in North America and APAC.
* Deutsche Börse declared a €4 per share dividend for 2024 and announced a €500 million share buyback program for 2025. CFO Gregor Pottmeyer highlighted these measures as part of a broader commitment to shareholder returns.

### Outlook

* For 2025, Deutsche Börse projects net revenues (excluding treasury results) of approximately €5.2 billion and EBITDA (excluding treasury results) of €2.7 billion. Treasury results are expected to exceed €0.8 billion.
* The company expects ARR in IMS to grow by 13%-18% annually, supported by continued SaaS adoption and strategic growth initiatives in key markets.
* Regulatory developments, including active account requirements under EMEA 3.0, are anticipated to drive strong growth in fixed income trading and OTC clearing activities.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 marked Deutsche Börse’s strongest quarter ever for net revenue, driven by seasonal strength in software solutions and record revenues in commodities, FX, and fund services. Net revenue (excluding treasury results) increased by 7%, while EBITDA (excluding treasury results) grew by 18%.
* Fund services achieved 19% growth in custody revenues and 42% growth in settlement services, supported by new client onboarding and record fund assets under custody of over €4 trillion.
* Security services performed strongly, with assets under custody reaching €15.7 trillion. Net interest income rose 17% year-over-year, driven by higher cash balances exceeding €19 billion in Q4.
* Operating costs increased by 2% in Q4, reflecting disciplined expense management, reduced exceptional costs, and targeted investments.

### Q&A

* Arnaud Giblat, BNP Paribas Exane, questioned the discrepancy between 17% ARR growth and 6% revenue growth in IMS. Management explained that the difference stemmed from IFRS revenue recognition and the ongoing SaaS transformation.
* Johannes Thormann, HSBC, inquired about non-ESG ISS STOXX business performance. CFO Gregor Pottmeyer acknowledged headwinds in Market Intelligence and Eurex, noting restructuring efforts and plans to enhance product offerings.

* During the Q&A, management adopted a more defensive tone to address restructuring and revenue recognition challenges but maintained confidence in achieving long-term goals.

### Risks and Concerns
