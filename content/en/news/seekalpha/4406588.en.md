Earnings Call Insights: WESCO International (NYSE:[WCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WCC "WESCO International, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO John Engel highlighted a return to sales growth in Q4, driven by over 70% growth in the data center business and 20% growth in broadband. Electrical and Electronics Solutions ([EES](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EES "WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Fund")) also showed positive momentum with its first growth since early 2023, though industrial customer activity slowed, and utility business remained weak.
* Engel emphasized progress in WESCO’s digital transformation and portfolio optimization, including the divestiture of its Integrated Supply business and acquisitions of higher-margin service businesses such as Ascent. He stated, "These strategic portfolio moves are integral to achieving our 10-plus percent EBITDA margin goals."
* Engel announced a 10% increase in the common stock dividend to $1.82 per share for 2025 and plans to redeem preferred equity in June to improve cash flow and earnings per share.
* CFO Dave Schulz reported flat Q4 sales year-over-year, with organic sales up 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were impacted by lower gross margins and slightly higher SG&A. Adjusted EPS rose 19% to $3.16. Schulz noted, "Free cash flow reached $268 million for the quarter, contributing to a record $1 billion for the year."

### Outlook

* Management projected 2025 organic sales growth between 2.5% and 6.5%, with operating margins expected to expand as all three business units aim for profitable growth. Free cash flow is forecasted at $600 million to $800 million.
* Gross margin improvement is anticipated, particularly in Communications and Security Solutions (CSS), as supplier volume rebates increase and as margins on data center projects normalize over time.
* Adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2025 is set at $12 to $14.50.
* CEO Engel expressed confidence in the company’s position to "outperform markets," citing secular trends such as AI-driven data centers, electrification, and reshoring.

### Financial Results

* Q4 organic sales rose 2%, with pricing contributing 1.5%, while volume growth was just under 1%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were affected by a 20-basis-point decline in gross margin, driven by lower supplier rebates.
* CSS delivered 11% organic growth, driven by a 70% increase in data center revenues, which now represent nearly 40% of CSS sales. However, large-scale projects with lower gross margins weighed on segment profitability.
* Utility and Broadband Solutions ([UBS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBS "UBS Group AG")) faced continued softness, with organic sales down 6% in Q4. Broadband sales grew more than 20%, supported by strong performance in Canada.
* Full-year free cash flow exceeded expectations, reaching over $1 billion, or 154% of adjusted net income, driven by effective working capital management.

### Q&A

* Sam Darkatsh, Raymond James: Asked about confidence in a second-half utility recovery. Engel cited "new customer wins ramping up in the second quarter" and "customer inventory levels normalizing by mid-year."
* Tommy Moll, Stephens: Queried the timing and funding of preferred equity redemption. Schulz confirmed plans for a June redemption funded through cash on hand or borrowing under existing facilities.
* Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer: Asked about public power versus investor-owned utilities. Engel noted "mid-single-digit declines" in both segments but emphasized confidence in long-term secular growth trends driven by rising power demand.
* Ken Newman, KeyBanc: Asked about CSS margin trajectory. Schulz highlighted the normalization of gross margins on data center projects, which initially weigh on profitability but improve as projects progress.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, repeatedly raising concerns over the utility segment’s recovery timeline and the impact of large project margins in CSS. Concerns about macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory delays also surfaced.
* Management maintained a confident stance during prepared remarks, emphasizing strong secular trends and operational improvements. However, during Q&A, Engel adopted a more measured tone, acknowledging near-term challenges in utility and industrial markets.
* CEO Engel’s optimism was evident in phrases like "I’m confident WESCO will outperform our markets again this year," while CFO Schulz appeared more reserved, focusing on cost controls and efficiency improvements.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 sales growth marked a reversal from Q3’s flat organic sales. CSS showed accelerating momentum, driven by data center growth, compared to Q3’s 40% growth in the segment.
* Utility and Broadband Solutions continued to face challenges, with Q4 performance largely mirroring Q3’s declines. However, broadband exhibited a notable improvement in Canada during Q4.
* Management’s tone shifted slightly, with greater emphasis on secular growth trends and portfolio optimization in Q4, compared to a more cautious outlook in Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Continued weakness in the utility segment due to customer destocking and delayed project activity.
* Margin pressures in CSS from large-scale data center projects with lower initial gross margins.
* Potential macroeconomic headwinds, including regulatory delays and interest rate impacts on customer spending.
* Sluggish industrial markets in the U.S., with uncertainty surrounding long-term recovery.

### Final Takeaway

WESCO International’s Q4 2024 earnings call highlighted robust growth in its data center and broadband segments, offset by persistent challenges in utility and industrial markets. Management remains optimistic about 2025, projecting organic sales growth of 2.5% to 6.5%, alongside margin improvements and strong free cash flow generation. However, near-term risks in utility and industrial markets warrant close monitoring as the company executes its strategic initiatives and prepares for a recovery in key segments.
