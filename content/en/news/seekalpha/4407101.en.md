Earnings Call Insights: Mineralys Therapeutics (NASDAQ:[MLYS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLYS "Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Jon Congleton highlighted the company's focus on advancing its pivotal trials for lorundrostat, targeting dysregulated aldosterone in patients with uncontrolled and resistant hypertension. He mentioned that data from the Advance-HTN trial is expected in March 2025, and Launch-HTN results are anticipated in the mid-first half of 2025.
* The Advance-HTN trial enrolled 285 participants to evaluate lorundrostat as an add-on therapy. The trial uses a rigorous standardized background regimen to confirm the presence of uncontrolled or resistant hypertension. Concurrently, the Launch-HTN trial, with 1,083 participants, aims to assess the benefit-risk profile of lorundrostat in a real-world setting.
* Congleton emphasized the potential of lorundrostat to transform hypertension treatment, particularly in resistant cases, and noted ongoing exploratory programs in chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea.
* CFO Adam Levy reported that the company ended the quarter with $198.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. He stated, "We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned clinical studies as well as support corporate operations through the first quarter of 2026."

### Outlook

* Management reiterated guidance for Advance-HTN top-line data in March 2025 and Launch-HTN results by mid-first half of 2025.
* Congleton highlighted the potential for lorundrostat to achieve an 8 to 10 mmHg reduction in blood pressure, a range aligned with prior trial results, to significantly impact the treatment paradigm for hypertension.
* The Explore-CKD Phase II trial, now fully enrolled, will assess lorundrostat in patients with chronic kidney disease, with data expected in Q2 2025.

### Financial Results

* R&D expenses for Q4 2024 were $44.6 million, driven by the ongoing pivotal programs. This marked a significant increase from $23.7 million in the same quarter last year.
* G&A expenses grew to $7.2 million for the quarter, attributed to higher compensation and professional fees.
* The company reported a net loss of $48.9 million for the quarter, compared to $24.4 million in Q4 2023.

### Q&A

* Michael DiFiore, Evercore ISI, questioned the applicability of earlier trial data to the larger pivotal studies. CEO Congleton responded, highlighting confidence in lorundrostat's blood pressure reduction efficacy, supported by exposure-response data from prior trials.
* Richard Law, Goldman Sachs, inquired about the timing of pivotal trial data dissemination. Congleton reiterated that Advance-HTN results are expected in March, while Launch-HTN data is anticipated in the following months.
* Annabel Samimy, Stifel, asked about payer perspectives on blood pressure reduction thresholds. Congleton explained that payers are likely to support lorundrostat's positioning if it achieves an 8 to 10 mmHg reduction in resistant hypertension patients.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed curiosity and optimism about lorundrostat's potential but pressed management for clarity on trial designs, compliance measures, and expected outcomes.
* Management exhibited confidence in both prepared remarks and responses, emphasizing rigorous trial designs and key milestones. Congleton's repeated assurance of timely data release reflected a strong belief in the company's clinical strategy.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, with a focus on progress and readiness for upcoming data readouts.

* Management maintained a confident tone, underscoring progress in trial execution and broader clinical programs.
* Analysts continued to focus on trial designs and market positioning, similar to the previous quarter.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged the need for robust compliance measures in trials to mitigate variability in results.
* Analysts raised concerns about data extrapolation from smaller sample sizes in earlier trials and potential variability introduced by real-world settings in Launch-HTN.
* Hyperkalemia risk in patients with lower eGFR was noted as a potential safety consideration in the ongoing trials.

### Final Takeaway
