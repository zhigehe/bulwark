U.S. equities fell on Friday as investors assessed a slew of news related to tariffs and inflation.

Major benchmarks slid during the session amid reports that President Donald Trump was planning reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. Equities had earlier turned negative after economic data showed a surge in consumers' year-ahead inflation expectations. That overshadowed an earlier soft job market reading in a signal that the Federal Reserve will likely be happy about.

Despite a sell-off on Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) gained 1.47% over the week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) was up 1.46%. The blue-chip Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) rose 0.85%.

Elsewhere, the week saw a slew of earnings announcements from major names across sectors.

**Palantir ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc."))** shares rose after the company issued a full-year revenue forecast that exceeded analysts’ estimates. CEO Alex Karp highlighted significant growth in the U.S. market and the company’s unique positioning in the AI revolution, stating, "We are at the way beginning of our trajectory."

**Amazon.com ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc."))** fell after warning investors about the ongoing chip supply constraints and power limitations affecting growth rates in its cloud computing division. The company also issued a lackluster forecast for FY25 and warned of foreign exchange headwinds.

**Lumen Technologies ([LUMN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUMN "Lumen Technologies, Inc."))** rose after the telecommunications firm reported better-than-expected Q4 profit and revenue. Analysts expressed concern over near-term revenue declines and public sector pressures, with a slightly skeptical tone regarding the timing of revenue inflections.

**Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated"))** fell amid investor concerns over demand for new smartphones, even as fiscal first quarter results beat estimates and drew largely positive reactions from analysts.

**Broadcom ([AVGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO "Broadcom Inc."))** gained after a higher-than-expected capital spending forecast from customer Alphabet, which accounts for 9% of the firm’s sales, according to Bloomberg supply chain data.

**Honeywell ([HON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON "Honeywell International Inc."))** fell after the industrial conglomerate announced plans to split into three independent companies. The move is a result of a comprehensive evaluation undertaken a year ago by chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur aimed at simplifying the company’s operating structure.

**Cloudflare ([NET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NET "Cloudflare, Inc."))** climbed after the software company reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations and issued an optimistic 2025 guidance, underscoring its growing enterprise and AI momentum.

**Uber Technologies ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc."))** fell after reporting weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings and operating income, overshadowing a steady bookings growth.

**Pinterest ([PINS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINS "Pinterest, Inc."))** rose after the company reported strong holiday-quarter revenue and issued an upbeat sales forecast for the current period.

**Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc."))** fell as Q4 revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company outlined $75B CapEx for 2025, with focus on AI and cloud infrastructure.

**Peloton ([PTON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON "Peloton Interactive, Inc."))** rose after it raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $60M to $300M-$350M, citing gross margin expansion and continued cost discipline.

**Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."))** fell after giving a disappointing outlook for its data center business, an area where it’s struggling to catch up with AI computing leader Nvidia Corp.

**Monolithic Power Systems ([MPWR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPWR "Monolithic Power Systems, Inc."))** shares gained after the semiconductor device company reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations and gave an upbeat sales outlook.

**Ford ([F](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F "Ford Motor Company"))** fell after the automaker’s conservative outlook, which imbedded an expectation for increased incentives and continued losses from its struggling EV unit, raised concerns about its path to increased profitability.

**Digital Turbine ([APPS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APPS "Digital Turbine, Inc."))** surged after the mobile software company exceeded Wall Street estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results and raised its annual guidance.

**Merck ([MRK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK "Merck & Co., Inc."))** shares tumbled premarket after the pharma giant issued an outlook for the year that fell short of Wall Street estimates and said it is temporarily pausing shipments of its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, to China from February through at least mid-year.

**Philip Morris International ([PM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM "Philip Morris International Inc."))** advanced after topping consensus estimates with its fourth quarter earnings report and setting favorable full-year profit guidance.

**Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc."))** slipped after the China Passenger Car Association reported that shipments of China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in January were down 11.5% from last year and 32.5% lower than December.

**Rigetti Computing ([RGTI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGTI "Rigetti Computing, Inc.")) +3.9%, Palantir Technologies ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")) +38.5% and Super Micro Computer ([SMCI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI "Super Micro Computer, Inc.")) +33.7%** were among the most traded stocks in the U.S. market this week.
