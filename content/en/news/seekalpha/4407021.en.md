Barrick Gold (NYSE:[GOLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD)) +6.8% in Wednesday's trading to its highest since November after reporting better than expected [Q4 adjusted earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406675-barrick-gold-reports-mixed-q4-results-initiates-fy25-outlook) and announcing a [new $1B stock buyback program](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406683-barrick-gold-sets-1b-stock-repurchase-plan), helped by surging prices for gold.

Q4 net earnings more than doubled to $996M, or $0.57/share, from $479M, or $0.27/share, in the year-earlier quarter, but revenues fell 19% Y/Y to $3.65B, below analyst expectations, as the company's average realized gold price jumped to $2,657/oz from $1,986/oz a year ago.

Q4 gold production rose 15% Q/Q to 1.08M oz, taking full-year output to 3.91M oz, down 3.5% from 2023 but in line with Barrick's (NYSE:[GOLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD "Barrick Gold Corporation")) forecast for annual production toward the lower end of its guidance of 3.9M-4.3M oz.

Q4 copper production climbed to 64K metric tons from 48K tons in Q3; for the year, copper output increased 2.1% to 195K tons, in line with the company's guidance for 180K-210K tons.

However, Barrick ([GOLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD "Barrick Gold Corporation")) lowered its FY 2025 gold production guidance to 3.15M-3.5M oz due to the temporary closure of its Loulo-Gounkoto mine in Mali, while attributable copper production for 2025 is projected to rise to 200K-230K tons, driven by increased output at its Lumwana mine in Zambia.

CEO Mark Bristow said Barrick ([GOLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD "Barrick Gold Corporation")) will resume operations at Loulo-Gounkoto when authorities in Mali allow it to resume gold shipments, and he has been assured by Mali officials that $245M worth of gold seized by authorities [still belongs to the company](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/barrick-will-resume-operations-mali-once-it-can-ship-gold-ceo-says-2025-02-12/).

"We will start the operations as soon as we get approval to ship the gold and we need to ship the gold to pay anything to the government," Bristow said.
