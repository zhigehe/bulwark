Piper Sandler has downgraded Q32 (NASDAQ:[QTTB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QTTB "Q32 Bio Inc.")) to neutral from overweight, citing the company's decision to discontinue its drug ADX-097 before presenting data from a renal basket study.

The investment bank said that after bempikibart’s failure in atopic dermatology and mixed results in alopecia areata, it had "held out hope that ADX-097 would at least produce a signal from the drug’s open-label renal basket study," adding, "it seems clear management has seen something that would negate this opportunity."

Piper said it was moving to neutral on the stock "until a better picture of bempikibart’s efficacy profile in AA emerges."

The bank dropped its price target for the stock to $4 from $20.
