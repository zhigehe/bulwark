DNY59





Sometimes, nothing beats ordering in for dinner.

While it's not *typically* the healthiest option in the world, there's something about curling up on the couch after a long day and firing up one of the delivery apps ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc."), [DASH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASH "DoorDash, Inc.")) that just **hits the spot**. It's typically quick, convenient, and - most importantly - doesn't require much effort. Sure, you pay a little more, but in some cases, it can be worth it:

It's not just us that think this - Uber Eats' and DoorDash's success is proof of the demand for delivery services. With both apps raking in billions every year, it's a growing, lucrative market.

However, it's not without its flaws.

In most big cities right now, after placing an order, a delivery person will go to the restaurant for you, pick up your food, and bring it to you. So far - so good; this is the typical delivery flow that everyone's used to. But hiring a human to go do this is expensive and potentially wasteful - what if a robot could deliver your order instead?

This is the core idea behind **Serve Robotics** (NASDAQ:[SERV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SERV "Serve Robotics Inc.")).

This startup company is seeking to disrupt the delivery market with last mile robots that can successfully navigate the modern street surface, deliver food, and save on cost.

While this appears to be a good idea - at least in theory - we see **significant** challenges to widespread adoption, including a poor customer experience, and a weak product-market fit.

Combined with dismal financials and an absolutely astronomical, speculative valuation, the stock appears to be one of the better 'short' opportunities in the market at present.

**Today**, we'll examine SERV's business model, give our outlook for the stock, and explain why we think shares could have 80% downside (or more) to 'Fair Value' over the next few years.

Sound good? Let's dive in.

SERV's Business
---------------

As we just mentioned, SERV is in the food delivery robot game, with the core idea behind the business being that delivery is - for the most part - inefficient:

[![SERV](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/51481993-1739269036046239.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/51481993-1739269036046239_origin.png)



IR





In some respects, we completely understand the impetus to solve this problem.

Food delivery is both physically demanding and low paying for the person delivering the food, while simultaneously (on a percentage basis) expensive for the person ordering.

What if we could automate this?

SERV's IR projections for this market show a huge growth opportunity, along with significant potential cost savings for the whole value chain:

[![SERV](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/51481993-1739269637790872.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/51481993-1739269637790872_origin.png)



IR





If SERV can automate down costs to $1 per delivery, then it could mean massive savings on the part of the apps (with increased profitability), alongside cheaper deliveries for consumers. Plus, it could mean less low paying, physically demanding jobs in our economy. The impact of that - short term - is probably negative, but probably beneficial in the long run.

So - why isn't SERV a massive '**Buy**'?

We see two key issues with SERV's main business model:

* **Last mile of last mile**
* **Product / market fit**

Let's start with 'last mile of last mile'. As they describe it, SERV is a last mile delivery company, taking small packages short distances. In the logistics business, this is typically the most 'annoying' bit of the delivery chain, as it can be the most 'finicky'.

When it comes to food delivery, SERV's robots - in some settings - appear to be a decent option to bring food short distances, but in reality, there are a lot of moving parts to any delivery. On the food end, a delivery person needs to interface with the restaurant to transfer the order. At the customer end, the delivery person needs to bring the order to the customer's door.

While robots may be good at the actual 'transport' bit, all of the touchpoints appear much harder for a robot to execute than a human.

We think that restaurants could probably figure out how to transfer orders efficiently if delivery robots take off, one of the key benefits of ordering for customers is the **convenience**. The food comes right to your door - even if you live in a building (as most do in big cities), and even if the weather stinks.

As it stands, with a delivery robot, you need to head down to the street and perform a pin-unlock procedure to retrieve your food. This action may necessitate a change of clothes, leaving a child unattended, or other inconveniences that a human delivery person completely ameliorates.

**Second**, delivery robots are potentially a poor option for most markets in the United States.

In places where cities are densely packed, we see a significant risk of inclement weather, uneven navigation surfaces, or human incidents reducing the effectiveness of robots. In more spaced-out neighborhoods, like suburbs, we see robots having a tough time on higher throughput, higher speed limit roads, and as distances grow, the potential for food to get cold increases.

Either way, Los Angeles's mostly even streets, fairly good weather, and ideal mix of urban sprawl could be one of the only cities where SERV's core offering actually 'works', in our view.

It makes sense why this is SERV's main testing ground, but we're skeptical about how the company will expand from here.

SERV's Financials
-----------------

So - we have concerns about SERV's core delivery robot business, but how has the company actually performed on the financial side?

At present, SERV has produced roughly TTM $1.7 million in revenue:

To bring in that revenue, SERV's total COGS and operating costs are massive, which has led to an extremely negative profit margin, to the tune of TTM -$33 million in net income:

Seeking Alpha





Obviously, much of these costs are investments into future revenue growth, but we're just laying out where the company currently sits.

On a cash basis, SERV's results have been a bit better, but not by much.

Since 2022, the company's quarterly cash from operations has held steady in the negative $3 million to negative $6 million dollar range, but losses only appear to be growing on a sequential basis:

Seeking Alpha





As it stands, the company has major partnerships with UBER and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) which are both large investors in the company, but right now, management simply isn't bringing in much in the way of revenue.

The core revenue driver at present is the company's delivery fleet, which the company plans on growing to 2,000 robots by the end of 2025:

IR





Management is expecting [$60 - $80 million in revenue](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735396-serve-robotics-inc-serv-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript) for this network of robots once scaled and deployed, a figure we find optimistic.

That said, even if the company can massively scale its robot network, for costs to remain low (and competitive), the company's expensive robots will have to do a huge number of trips to recoup cost and eventually turn a profit.

On this front, we're skeptical that the SERV's long-term unit economics make sense, due to all of the aforementioned concerns.

We'll need to wait and see how this rollout progresses, but at the moment, we're pessimistic going into this crucial year for the company.

SERV's Valuation
----------------

So - how expensive is the stock?

Sure, we're not bullish on SERV's core offering value prop, or the company's financial projections, but if the stock was a good price, then it might be worth a speculative shot.

Here's the thing - shares appear stretched to the absolute extreme.

Right now, SERV is valued at **$1.02 billion** on the open market, trading at roughly **70x FWD Sales**.

If you subtract out the $50 million in cash, then you're looking at $970 million to own the entirety of the company.

And what does that company produce?

* -$4 million to -$6 million in quarterly cash from operations
* $1.7 million in annual revenue

Ok - but what does that $970 million company own?

* $8 million in gross property, plant, and equipment.

Ok - but long term, the company might make somewhere between $60 - $80 million in ARR from a fully operationalized fleet in LA.

Even with this projection - which is still a long way away - **how does this make any sense?**

Even if the company grows its top line *100x* over the next three years, we're still looking at revenues of $170 million, which are both higher than what management projects, and *much* higher than we expect may come to fruition.

Additionally, that $170 million figure *still* appears expensive on a sales basis for a small, likely (at that point) breakeven player, at 5.7x top line results.

Sure, the potential growth **rates** have gotten people excited, but they're coming off of such a **small base of revenue** that we see the present valuation for SERV as nothing but a speculative mirage.

With a Fair Value probably somewhere closer to $200 million (2.5x *potentially scaled* sales - a fair balance between execution risk and other growth stories), we're looking at a **downside of more than 80%** in the stock.

Whether you're shorting it alone or pairing it against a more speculative 'long' like **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT "Reddit, Inc.")), we see the stock as a '**Strong Sell**' over the interim as results come in.

How We're Wrong
---------------

So, we think SERV is a relatively weak-looking company with a wildly optimistic valuation - a perfect storm for a short setup.

What's the holdup?

In our view, there are some risks worth considering before taking a short position, especially given the market's recent momentum.

In short, we think the market appears expensive and, potentially, in a frothy bubble.

**Rumble** ([RUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RUM "Rumble Inc.")), a recent company we called for a short on, announced a bitcoin treasury program and saw its stock blast off overnight. Things like this are happening in small and medium cap land, so there's some headline risk here.

As rates come down, investors are also throwing money at high growth rates, even if results seem hard to see, or appear to be far off into the future.

So, while we think SERV appears to be a clear 'Strong Sell', the stock's solid momentum of late could present a risk. If it continues to the upside, then short traders could be underwater.

If this happens, we see it as a temporary risk, but in order to short something this volatile, you need to be able to take some punches. Size appropriately.

One last thing - the cost to borrow shares to short is [currently around 10% annualized](https://companiesmarketcap.com/serve-robotics/cost-to-borrow/). This is considerably higher than the average stock, which makes a short bet on SERV potentially costly. That said, given our time horizon for this trade is 1-2 years, given the fair value mismatch we see, it's still a positive EV to take the trade.

Summary
-------

Overall, despite the positive sentiment and the risks around further momentum gains, we see SERV as a '**Strong Sell**'.

With a shaky product-market fit, optimistic revenue projections, and an extremely stretched multiple, shares seem like a clear shorting opportunity.

Stay safe out there!
