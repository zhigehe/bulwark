Avadel Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[AVDL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVDL "Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc")) jumped 12% after a holder said the company should explore a sale.

ASL Strategic Value Fund said in a letter to Avadel's (NASDAQ:[AVDL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVDL "Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc")) board on Monday said the company needs to hire a bank to explore its alternatives, according to a [statement](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996726-asl-strategic-value-fund-letter-to-avadel-pharmaceuticals-avdl-nasdaq-board-of-directors " statement ") on Monday.

"This can only be accomplished by immediately retaining an investment bank to explore all possible alternatives including the outright sale of the company and distributing to existing shareholders a contingent value right which will receive the recovery from the numerous pending lawsuits against Jazz Pharmaceuticals," Steve Braverman, managing partner of ASL Strategic wrote in the letter.

"The current launch has failed in delivering a significant return to the company's shareholders," Braverman added. "It is now time to monetize these two significant assets to create value for the owners of this company."
