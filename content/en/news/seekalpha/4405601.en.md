TD Cowen has started coverage of Repligen (NASDAQ:[RGEN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGEN "Repligen Corporation")) with a buy rating, citing the company's limited exposure to NIH funding cuts and China.

The investment bank said Repligen (NASDAQ:[RGEN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGEN "Repligen Corporation")) was "well-positioned for industry-leading growth and margin expansion given over-indexed exposure to new modalities and differentiated product offerings." 

It added that limited exposure to NIH and China "should shield them from near-term sector headwinds facing peers."

TD Cowen also believes that the company's "new modalities and AI efficiencies are underappreciated" and position the company to outperform over the near and longer term.

The bank set its price target for the stock at $200.
