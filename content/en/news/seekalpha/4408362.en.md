### Management View

* CEO Sam Rubin highlighted the acquisition of G5 Infrared as a transformative step for the company, positioning LightPath as a key player in the cooled infrared camera market. G5's cameras, with ASPs ranging from $50,000 to $500,000, significantly elevate the company's product offerings. Rubin stated that G5's addition is expected to bring $21M to $27M in revenue over the next 12 months.
* Rubin emphasized G5's strategic fit, citing its pipeline of programs in border security, naval applications, and counter-UAS detection. The acquisition is projected to help LightPath surpass $55M in combined revenue in the next 12 months.
* CFO Albert Miranda noted that G5 consistently delivers EBITDA margins of 20% or higher, with strong financial performance and growth potential.

### Outlook

* Rubin stated that G5 has already received its first order for new Customs and Border Patrol surveillance towers, with shipments underway. He expects the naval program to move into low rate initial production (LRIP) by the end of calendar 2025, with potential annual revenue of $10M to $20M during production.
* Management reiterated that they do not provide specific quarterly guidance but encouraged investors to review G5's earnout projections, indicating strong growth expectations.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $7.4M, up 1.5% year-over-year, driven by sales of infrared components and modules. Infrared components contributed $3.1M, while assemblies and modules added $0.9M.
* Gross profit declined 11% to $1.9M, representing 26% of total revenue, due to supply chain disruptions and product mix. Operating expenses rose to $4.4M, reflecting higher legal and consulting fees, including $174,000 tied to the G5 acquisition.
* The company reported a net loss of $2.6M or ($0.07) per share, compared to a loss of $1.7M or ($0.05) per share in the prior year.

### Q&A

* Jaeson Schmidt, Lake Street Capital Markets: Questioned gross margin issues and cross-selling opportunities with G5. Rubin explained that yield issues were exacerbated by supply chain delays but noted strong cross-selling potential between G5's cooled cameras and LightPath's uncooled cameras.
* Glenn Mattson, Ladenburg Thalmann: Inquired about G5's LRIP timeline. Rubin confirmed prototype shipments within six to eight months and LRIP by late 2025.
* Orin Hirschman, AIGH Investment Partners: Asked about supply chain risks following Chinese export restrictions. Miranda indicated $2M in U.S. germanium sales remain at risk but highlighted local sourcing and BlackDiamond alternatives as mitigation strategies.
* Brian Kinstlinger, Alliance Global Partners: Sought clarity on MANTIS camera adoption. Rubin noted initial traction in the furnace and gas detection markets, with revenues expected to ramp in the next six to eight months.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* The strategic focus shifted significantly, with Q2 dominated by the G5 acquisition and its implications, compared to Q1's emphasis on internal product developments like the MANTIS camera.
