### Management View

* CEO Kjetel Digre highlighted that the company achieved revenue growth of almost 50% in 2024, reaching NOK 53.2 billion, and improved EBITDA margins to 8.7%, or 7.3% excluding net income from OneSubsea. He emphasized that the order backlog stood at NOK 61 billion by year-end, with over half tied to the Alliance model with Aker BP, which enhances project quality and efficiency.
* The CEO noted a strong start to 2025 with multiple new contracts, including Norfolk Vanguard East and West and a carbon capture project in Oslo. The tender pipeline increased to NOK 86 billion, with a mix of oil and gas, renewables, and decarbonization opportunities.
* CFO Idar Eikrem reported Q4 revenue of NOK 15.7 billion, reflecting 43% year-on-year growth. Full-year EBITDA was NOK 4.6 billion, supported by high activity in the life cycle and field development segments. Net income for the quarter was NOK 837 million, with earnings per share rising to NOK 6.62 for the full year. The Board proposed a dividend of NOK 3.30 per share for 2024, a 65% increase from the prior year.

### Outlook

* Management provided a 2025 revenue guidance range of NOK 50 billion to NOK 55 billion, supported by secured backlog and new orders in early 2025. EBITDA margin is projected between 7% and 7.5%, excluding net income from OneSubsea.
* The company noted improvements in commercial models for renewables projects, transitioning from legacy lump-sum contracts to more balanced risk-reward agreements. Legacy projects are expected to conclude in 2025.
* The CEO emphasized that the tender pipeline includes a healthy mix of oil and gas, renewables, and decarbonization efforts, with ongoing renegotiations of long-term agreements for maintenance and modifications.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue increased to NOK 15.7 billion, with the renewable and field development segment contributing NOK 11.5 billion, a 54% year-on-year increase.
