Shares of CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:[CYBR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYBR "CyberArk Software Ltd.")) rose about 5% premarket on Thursday after fourth-quarter results beat estimates, and outlook slightly surpassed expectations.

The identity security solution provider saw fourth-quarter [revenue](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001209-cyberark-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results#hasComeFromMpArticle "revenue") jump about 41% year-over-year to $314.4M. Meanwhile, non-GAAP [EPS](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407577-cyberark-beats-q4-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-q1-and-fy25-outlook "EPS") was $0.80 compared to $0.81 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Both top and bottom-line numbers beat estimates.

"Total ARR reached $1.169 billion, driven by organic ARR crossing $1 billion and the outperformance from Venafi. With our strong revenue growth and free cash flow margin, we returned to Rule of 40 on a full year basis – beating our long-term guidance framework by a full year," said CyberArk’s CEO Matt Cohen.

The company's subscription revenue soared 62% year-over-year to $243M. Perpetual license revenue was $5M, compared to $8M in the fourth quarter of 2023.

**Outlook Q1**: CyberArk expects first quarter revenue to be between $301.0 M and $307 (midpoint at $304M) versus the consensus estimate of $304M. The company forecast non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.81 (midpoint at $0.775) versus [consensus](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYBR/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly "consensus") of $0.77.

**Outlook full year 2025**: The company expects revenue to be between $1.308B and $1.318B (midpoint at $1.313B) versus the consensus of $1.30B. CyberArk forecast non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.70 (midpoint at $3.625) versus consensus of $3.62.

The company noted that Venafi contributed to its results in the fourth quarter of 2024 and did not contribute to the first, second and third quarter periods. The guidance for the first quarter and full year 2025 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Zilla Security, which closed on Feb. 12.
