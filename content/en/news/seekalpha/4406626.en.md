Getaround ([OTCPK:GETR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GETR "Getaround, Inc.")) [plans to commence](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999265-getaround-inc-announces-wind-down-of-u-s-operations "plans to commence") an orderly wind-down of its U.S. business operations, which includes its car-share and HyreCar businesses.

The company's European business will continue operating to provide car-sharing services for customers in all current European markets.

"Despite significant improvements in overall profitability and extensive restructuring efforts, the Company has faced an ongoing lack of liquidity which has made U.S. operations no longer viable. We are deeply grateful to our dedicated Getarounders and loyal hosts and guests in the U.S. for their unwavering support and commitment to Getaround and HyreCar over the years. Their contributions have been invaluable, and the company truly appreciates all that they have done." said AJ Lee, Interim CEO and COO.
