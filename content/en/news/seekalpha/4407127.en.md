He highlighted strong underwriting results across all regions and business lines, citing a combined ratio of 86.5%, four points better than the prior year.
* Premium growth in Personal Lines was in the double digits, with personal auto premiums growing 12% and personal property premiums up 9%, driven by customer additions and rate increases. The company anticipates hard market conditions persisting over the next 12 months, further supporting growth.
* CEO Brindamour emphasized the company's strategic focus on pricing sophistication and AI adoption, noting that over 500 AI models have been deployed, contributing $150 million in underwriting profit.
* CFO Louis Marcotte noted total catastrophe losses at $1.5 billion for the year and announced an increase in annual catastrophe guidance to $1.2 billion for 2025. Despite this, he confirmed that combined ratio guidance across lines remains unchanged.
* CFO Marcotte also highlighted a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.33, marking the 20th consecutive annual increase. Total capital margin stood at $2.9 billion, and the adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 19.4%.

### Q&A

* Doug Young, Desjardins Capital Markets: Questioned market pricing trends in Ontario auto and any election-related pressures.

Mid-single-digit rate increases are expected as pricing normalizes.
* Tom MacKinnon, BMO Capital Markets: Asked about tariff impacts on personal property and auto. CEO Brindamour and COO Patrick Barbeau outlined limited exposure to U.S. tariffs, noting that only 40% of auto repair costs are material and, of that, one-third are U.S. dependent.
