U.S. copper futures jumped to the highest in nearly nine months Monday after President Trump said he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, on top of existing metals duties, lifting the premium of Comex futures over those traded on the London Metal Exchange to a [record high](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-copper-price-premium-soars-record-after-trump-tariff-moves-2025-02-10/ "record high") $920/metric ton from $558 on Friday.

Front-month Comex copper ([HG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HG1:COM "Copper Futures")) for February delivery closed +2.6% to $4.7005/lb, its sixth consecutive daily gain and highest settlement value since May 29, 2024; the front-month Comex contract is now up more than 10% in February and nearly 18% YTD.

ETFs: (NYSEARCA:[CPER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPER "United States Copper Index Fund, LP ETF")), (NYSEARCA:[COPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COPX "Global X Copper Miners ETF")), ([OTC:JJCTF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JJCTF "iPathÂ® Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return(<a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SM' title='SM Energy Company'>SM</a>) ETN"))

Trump said last week he also planned to impose tariffs on copper, without giving details, but the Comex premium vs. LME implied that the market was pricing in the equivalent of a 10.5% tariff on copper, Benchmark Minerals Intelligence said.

The previous peak in the premium occurred when it hit $655/ton, as Comex copper hit an all-time high of $5.1985/lb due to a short squeeze; at the time, parties were forced to buy back their short positions at a loss or deliver physical copper to close them out.
