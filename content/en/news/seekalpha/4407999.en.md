Earnings Call Insights: Valmet Oyj ([OTCPK:VOYJF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOYJF "Valmet Oyj")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Thomas Hinnerskov highlighted a landmark €1 billion Arauco order in Q4, the largest single-phase pulp mill project globally, as a key achievement. He noted that while orders reached record levels, net sales and comparable EBITA did not grow in 2024, reflecting challenges in the pulp and paper industry.
* The company’s order backlog stands at €4.5 billion, with €1.3 billion expected to be realized in 2025. Significant growth in stable business components like services and automation was emphasized as a crucial foundation for resilience.
* Hinnerskov discussed plans for a strategic renewal aimed at defining future growth areas, simplifying operations, and improving cost efficiency.
* CFO Katri Hokkanen reported record cash flow of €554 million for the year, emphasizing strong cash conversion and a lower gearing ratio of 39% by year-end. She noted Q4's record orders of €2.5 billion, including the Arauco project.

### Outlook

* Guidance for 2025 anticipates flat net sales and comparable EBITA compared to 2024, with €200 million less expected from the order backlog relative to the prior year.
* Despite market challenges, Hinnerskov noted potential growth in shorter-cycle stable businesses and a focus on improving cost competitiveness as part of the ongoing strategic review.
* Automation customer activity is expected to remain stable, with strong performances in North America and the Middle East offsetting softness in Europe and China.

### Financial Results

* Q4 net sales were €1.5 billion, the highest quarterly figure in 2024, while comparable EBITA reached €192 million, with a margin of 12.6% driven by favorable sales mix and a strong performance in services.
* Process Technologies reported a disappointing comparable EBITA margin of 2.8%, impacted by lower net sales and operational inefficiencies. The segment’s margins remain a focus for improvement.
* Service orders hit a record €1.9 billion for the year, with Q4 margins reaching 19.8%, boosted by strong mill improvement project demand and favorable development in fabrics.
* Automation orders increased to €1.4 billion for the year, with significant contributions from the API acquisition, although integration costs pressured margins. Organic growth in automation systems was 7% for 2024.

### Q&A

* Antti Kansanen, SEB: Questioned the lack of margin expansion in 2025 guidance despite an improving sales mix. CEO Hinnerskov emphasized that challenging market conditions in Process Technologies and the need for cost adjustments are key factors.
* Sven Weier, UBS: Inquired about capacity for additional large-scale pulp projects. Hinnerskov affirmed readiness for future projects, emphasizing strong execution capabilities and proven technologies.
* Johan Eliason, Kepler Cheuvreux: Asked about dividend policy amidst a flat dividend recommendation. Hinnerskov noted the strategic review would reassess financial targets, including capital allocation options such as share buybacks.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious concern over flat guidance and the challenging pulp and paper market, with a focus on Valmet's ability to execute cost efficiency measures and drive growth in stable businesses.
* Management maintained a pragmatic tone during the call, emphasizing strategic renewal and operational improvements. Hinnerskov expressed confidence in addressing market challenges, highlighting the company’s strong foundation and resilience.
* Compared to Q3, there was a slightly defensive shift in management’s tone, with increased emphasis on cost control and addressing market softness.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 orders surged, driven by the Arauco project, compared to moderate Q3 levels. However, Process Technologies' margins fell sequentially, reflecting ongoing challenges in the segment.
* Management tone in Q4 was more focused on addressing strategic and operational challenges, compared to the relatively optimistic tone following Q3 results.
* Analysts in Q4 showed heightened concern over weak markets and Process Technologies' margins, whereas Q3 concerns centered on the delayed impact of stable business growth.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted market softness in Europe and China as headwinds, particularly in board and paper. Overcapacity in these regions is a concern for the recovery timeline.
* Analyst questions underscored risks tied to Process Technologies' profitability and the potential for tariff impacts on operations in key markets.
* The integration of API was noted as a margin drag, with management acknowledging the need for further operational improvements.

### Final Takeaway

Valmet’s Q4 performance demonstrated strong order growth and record cash flow, anchored by the Arauco project. However, flat 2025 guidance underscored persistent challenges in Process Technologies and the broader pulp market. Management’s focus on strategic renewal, cost competitiveness, and stable business growth aims to bolster resilience amid a complex operating environment.
