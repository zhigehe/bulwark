Earnings Call Insights: eGain Corporation (NASDAQ:[EGAN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EGAN "eGain Corporation")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* CEO Ashu Roy announced the acquisition of several new enterprise clients, including a major U.S. airline, a global entertainment company, and a money transfer company, driven by demand for the AI Knowledge Hub offering. He highlighted that the number of seven-figure deals in the pipeline more than doubled over the last six months, which is contributing to extended sales cycles.
* Roy described market trends such as increased focus on knowledge centralization and broader use cases extending beyond customer service to employee and partner services. He emphasized the strategic importance of eGain AI Agent, a new omnichannel conversational product that is on track for launch in the current quarter.
* CFO Eric Smit reported a 17% year-over-year growth in AI Knowledge Hub ARR and revealed that SaaS revenue accounted for 93% of Q2 total revenue. He noted a decrease in professional services (PS) revenue due to product improvements and strategic partnerships, prompting a $2M reduction in FY2025 PS revenue targets.

### Outlook

* Q3 2025 revenue guidance is projected between $21M and $21.5M, factoring in a shorter quarter and non-recurrence of $600,000 in usage-based revenue from Q2.
* FY2025 revenue guidance was revised to $88.5M-$90M, down from $92M-$93M, reflecting extended sales cycles for large deals and reduced PS revenue. Non-GAAP net income guidance for FY2025 was adjusted to $4.1M-$4.7M or $0.14-$0.16 per share.
* The company anticipates GAAP net loss for Q3 to range between $300,000 and $800,000, with non-GAAP net income expected between breakeven and $500,000.

### Financial Results

* Q2 2025 total revenue was $22.4M, down 6% year-over-year, attributed to the loss of two large clients last year. SaaS gross margin remained steady at 78%, while total gross margin was 71%.
* Non-GAAP operating costs increased 9% year-over-year to $14.7M, driven by a 21% increase in R&D investment. Non-GAAP net income was $1.3M or $0.05 per share on a basic basis and $0.04 per share on a diluted basis.
* Cash flow from operations totaled $6.4M, with $70.5M in cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. The company repurchased approximately 421,000 shares for $2.4M during the quarter.
* ARR for AI knowledge customers grew 17% year-over-year and accounted for 55% of total SaaS ARR, a 46% increase from the prior year.

### Q&A

* Jeff Van Rhee, Craig-Hallum, inquired about the substantial reduction in PS revenue guidance and whether staffing adjustments are necessary. CEO Ashu Roy attributed the reduction to product enhancements and third-party partnerships, emphasizing that it aligns with the company’s strategy for faster deployments.
* Van Rhee also asked about the competitive landscape for the U.S. airline client. Roy explained that the deal involved consolidating multiple knowledge systems, including legacy solutions and Microsoft CRM, to create a centralized platform.
* Richard Baldry, ROTH Capital, questioned whether AI confusion in the market still affects sales cycles. Roy noted a trend of businesses seeking centralized knowledge hubs to operationalize AI effectively, despite ongoing market noise from new entrants.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analyst sentiment was slightly negative, with a focus on concerns over reduced PS revenue and extended sales cycles for large deals. Questions showed skepticism about the timeline for realizing benefits from AI investments and partnerships.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, highlighting achievements in client acquisition and pipeline growth. However, responses during the Q&A reflected defensiveness, particularly regarding PS revenue cuts and competitive dynamics.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, emphasizing long-term opportunities despite short-term challenges. Analysts appeared more cautious this quarter, reflecting concerns over revised guidance and market uncertainties.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for FY2025 revenue was reduced from $92M-$93M to $88.5M-$90M, whereas non-GAAP net income guidance was also lowered. In contrast, GAAP net income guidance improved slightly.
* ARR growth for AI knowledge customers accelerated from 16% in Q1 to 17% in Q2, with the share of AI knowledge ARR increasing significantly year-over-year.
* Analysts' focus shifted from new bookings and RFP activity in Q1 to the impact of extended sales cycles for large deals and reductions in PS revenue.
* Management’s tone remained optimistic about AI-driven growth but acknowledged challenges in deal closures.

### Risks and Concerns

* Extended sales cycles for large strategic deals due to increased scrutiny and vetting processes.
* Reduced PS revenue guidance for FY2025 due to product enhancements and partnerships.
* Concentration risk from the loss of two large clients last year continues to impact revenue performance.

### Final Takeaway

eGain Corporation highlighted strong growth in its AI Knowledge Hub business, driven by new enterprise client wins and increasing demand for centralized knowledge solutions. However, extended sales cycles for large deals and reduced professional services revenue led to a downward revision in FY2025 revenue guidance. Management remains optimistic about the long-term strategic opportunity in the AI knowledge market, supported by continued investments in product innovation and client partnerships.
