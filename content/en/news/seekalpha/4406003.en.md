WK Kellogg Co (NYSE:[KLG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLG "WK Kellogg Co")) reported sales fell 1.7% year-over-year to $640 million in Q4 to miss the consensus expectation by $5.1 million

Price/mix was up 1.8% during the quarter, but volume was 5.6% lower. The sales decline was noted to be due to the ongoing challenging business environment and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation, resulting from the weakening of the Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Adjusted EBITDA was up 7.5% Y/Y to $57 million, and the EBITDA margin improved. Operating profit was up 4.8% Y/Y to $22 million. EPS was reported at $0.42 vs. $0.26 consensus and $0.29 a year ago.

"I am pleased with our overall 2024 financial results, including delivering adjusted EBITDA growth above the top end of our guidance range," stated CEO Gary Pilnick.

Looking ahead, the company's 2025 organic sales growth is projected to be approximately down 1%. 2025 adjusted EBITDA growth is projected to be up 4.0% to 6.0%. The guidance does not factor in any impact from potential tariffs on Mexico and Canada.

Shares of WK Kellogg (KLH) were up 4.2% in premarket trading to $16.99 vs. the 52-week range of $13.10 to $24.63.
