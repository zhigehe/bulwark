Victor Golmer





Novo Nordisk ([NVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO "Novo Nordisk A/S")) shares have come down quite a bit in recent months. The stock peaked at around $148 last June and is now in the $83 range. On December 20, the stock fell around 18% after disappointing trial results for its [CagriSema drug](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/novo-nordisk-shares-plunge-22percent-after-cagrisema-obesity-drug-trial-results.html). The stock hasn't recovered since then despite a good earnings report and [positive topline Phase Ib/IIa data](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/novo-rebounds-as-next-gen-obesity-drug-elicits-up-to-22-weight-loss#:~:text=Amycretin%20was%20uptitrated%20to%205,a%20weight%20increase%20of%202.0%25.) for its future obesity treatment, amycretin.

On top of that, the valuation now looks good, as its P/E ratio is more in line with historical levels, and the stock has a PEG ratio under 1x. This allows investors to buy shares of a growing, highly profitable weight-loss-drug leader without paying an arm and a leg.

Additionally, dips in this stock come every few years or so, and they've always ended up being buying opportunities in hindsight. I would be surprised if this time is any different. As a result, Novo Nordisk stock is a Strong Buy in my books.

NVO Stock Still Hasn't Recovered From The CagriSema Results, But It Can Soon
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the CagriSema trial results were made public on December 20, NVO stock closed the day at $85. The December 19 close was $103.44. Now, the stock price is even lower. Investors were unhappy with the fact that the trial results pointed to a 22.7% weight reduction for patients over a 68-week period, less than the 25% the company had expected.

Meanwhile, the company actually was pleased with the result, with Novo Nordisk's vice president saying:

> We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose.

Perhaps the 25% figure wasn't achieved because only 57% of patients reached the highest dose. That's important to note, and it makes the 22.7% result not seem as bad. At the same time, I'm questioning why only 57% reached the highest dose. Is it not very tolerable at the full dose? That's something worth considering, but overall, I don't think the situation warranted such a big drop. It seemed like an overreaction to me. We're talking about an 18% drop in a company that was then worth well over $400 billion.

Besides, the company's amycretin treatment looks promising and adds upside potential, so I'll discuss that for a bit.

Amycretin Results Gave The Stock A Short-Lived Boost
----------------------------------------------------

On January 24, when Amycretin trial results were published, NVO stock rebounded by over 10% at one point before finishing the day ~8.5% higher.

Here are the results:

> Amycretin was uptitrated to 5 mg by 28 weeks, at which point patients lost 16.2% of their weight, whereas placebo counterparts gained 2.3%.
> 
> By 36 weeks, the amycretin dose had been bumped up to 20 mg, resulting in 22% weight-loss. Placebo counterparts at this time point saw a weight increase of 2.0%.

This was great news. The weight reduction achieved is slightly less than the 22.7% from the CagriSema results, but this was achieved in just 36 weeks, not 68. This compares favorably to [Zepbound's 20.2% weight loss](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lillys-zepbound-tirzepatide-superior-to-wegovy-semaglutide-in-head-to-head-trial-showing-an-average-weight-loss-of-20-2-vs-13-7-302322351.html) in 72 weeks (Zepbound belongs to Eli Lilly ([LLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY "Eli Lilly and Company"))).

Nonetheless, the stock has since given back its gains, as Amycretin is still in the relatively early stages of testing, so it won't be ready anytime soon. But it does offer some longer-term upside potential.

Earnings Results Were Solid
---------------------------

Novo Nordisk reported its [Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings results](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=915255) on February 5. This sent the stock around 4% higher before it eventually gave up its gains (again) in the next few trading sessions. Still, the company's results were good, in my view, especially for a stock that has been performing so poorly recently.

Novo Nordisk's sales increased by 25% in Danish kroner (26% at constant exchange rates), reaching DKK 290.4 billion for the full year -- around $40.34 billion. Its operating profit also increased by the same respective percentages to DKK 128.3 billion -- $17.83 billion at the current exchange rate.

The Obesity Care segment drove lots of growth, with sales for this segment up 56% in DKK (up 57% at constant exchange rates) to DKK 65.1 billion, as demand for GLP-1-based treatments like Wegovy increased despite intense competition.

And although the company's free cash flow was negative for the quarter, at -$527.8 million, full-year FCF was strong at $10.25 billion, allowing the company to increase its dividend by 21% to DKK 11.40 per share.

Additionally, the company's 2025 outlook was good enough to impress me at the current valuation. The company expects sales growth between 16% and 24% at constant exchange rates, with operating profits expected to increase by 19-27%. With ~20% growth projected for this year, Novo Nordisk seems far from dead.

The Valuation Has Become Reasonable
-----------------------------------

Following the stock's recent decline, the P/E ratio has come down considerably to the 25x range. That's more in line with historical levels, as you can see below. In this sense, the stock is reasonably priced.

![Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/saupload_412158e858f7a0c83c57680f2f3916c8.png)

Data by YCharts



Meanwhile, its [forward P/E is 22.1x](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO/valuation/metrics), much lower than its five-year average of 31.5x, but it's also worth noting that the stock was overvalued before due to GLP-1 hype, so it's worth looking further back. Per tikr.com, its NTM P/E ratio is 21.9x, lower than the 25.3x average of the past 10 years, suggesting a good entry point.

NVO Stock Historical Forward P/E Ratio (tikr.com)





Considering the high-quality nature of the company and that the stock's earnings are expected to grow by 21.1% this year (according to the ratings of 21 analysts, per simplywall.st) and by 22.1% in 2026, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the stock to maintain its current P/E ratio. After all, a 25.5x P/E ratio is not too much to ask for when such a large company is growing in the double-digits.

And the long-term growth potential is promising. For example, this report from *Polaris Market Research* suggests:

> The global [GLP-1 analogues market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yHW-ymiaJKmtxBWt4UDCz6KDScB2N3yoRFCqoPD7HWmXcwM2M08A5ttk__Zk-ITl6x1g5M2qSr8IKQ5nA6IC8qJOPVLHPH7y0WJf8qWZOsHp3aQ2jSQczZSl6We4bPyBZXyqY-_YXluZ6_dXgFayUjRCDVY_ylDYqWq_LL5yQ-w=) size was assessed at USD 46.70 billion in 2024. The market is expected to flourish and grow from USD 56.62 billion in 2025 to USD 322.85 billion by 2034, denoting a CAGR of 21.3% between 2025â€“2034.

Similarly, GrandView Research said that the obesity treatment market was [valued at $15.92 billion in 2024](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/obesity-treatment-devices-and-therapeutics-market#:~:text=Obesity%20Treatment%20Market%20Size%20%26%20Trends,22.31%25%20from%202025%20to%202030.) and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 22.31% from 2025 to 2030.

I know I'm ignoring the Rare Disease segment of the company, but the Diabetes and Obesity care markets are where the growth is and where most of the company's revenues come from.

Therefore, if NVO stock maintains its P/E ratio in the next year or two, then the stock's gains will be in line with EPS growth -- potentially over 20% per year.

Moreover, it's not that common to find high-quality growth stocks trading with forward PEG ratios under 1x (under 1x for this metric indicates that a stock is undervalued). NVO's forward non-GAAP PEG ratio is currently 0.91x, giving it an ["A" grade on Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO/valuation/metrics) for this metric.

Past Dips Were Buying Opportunities. Is Now Any Different?
----------------------------------------------------------

Looking back over the years, has there really been any major dip in NVO stock that didn't prove to be a buying opportunity? The chart below says "No."

[![NVO Stock Chart](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59531542-17393319430471697.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59531542-17393319430471697_origin.png)

That's likely because the company keeps growing its earnings, and this is set to continue. So, is now really any different? I don't think so.

Here's a longer-term chart (a logarithmic one to help make it easier to visualize). As you can see, dips have generally been short-lived, and you now have a chance to buy a healthcare juggernaut near its 50-month simple moving average.

The Risks
---------

While Novo Nordisk stock is less risky now due to its lower valuation, there are still risks. The company faces intense competition from Eli Lilly's Zepbound, which has shown promising results (20.2% weight reduction in 72 weeks vs. 13.7% for Novo Nordisk's Wegovy). This rivalry can impact NVO's market share.

However, at the moment, the company's market share is strong and has remained relatively unchanged year-over-year. This is something I'll be monitoring going forward, but the market is big enough for more than one player, regardless.

Additionally, there are political risks, such as [discussions about drug pricing reforms](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-targets-novo-nordisks-diabetes-drug-ozempic-medicare-price-talks-2025-01-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), which can obviously impact the company's operations.

Lastly, despite the valuation looking reasonable now from a historical perspective, there have been times when the valuation has dropped much lower than current levels. Nothing is stopping the same thing from happening again.

The Takeaway
------------

NVO stock has fallen significantly recently, mainly due to the disappointing CagriSema trial results. However, the drug still achieved a 22.7% weight reduction despite only 57% of patients reaching the highest dose. This implies that the drug still has some potential.

Further, the company's amycretin drug has shown some strong results in the early stages, and this offers more long-term upside potential alongside the quickly growing GLP-1 and obesity care markets.

NVO's recent earnings report also reaffirmed the strength of its business, as sales grew by 26%, with lots of momentum in Obesity Care, and its market share stayed relatively steady.

At the current valuation, Novo Nordisk stock is attractive, with a forward PEG ratio of 0.91x and earnings set to grow at over 20% per year for the next two years, while the P/E ratio has dropped closer to average levels historically.

Yes, there are risks (competition and political headwinds), but I view this as an opportunity to buy a high-quality growth company at a good price. Plus, given the stock's history of recovering from significant dips (because earnings growth has been consistent), this dip isn't likely to be any different, in my opinion.
