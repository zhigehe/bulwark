Federal Reserve policymakers should be talking about raising interest rates if they want to hit their inflation goal, economist Mohamed El-Erian said Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marched higher in January. 

The [January Consumer Price Index report](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi "January Consumer Price Index report") featured increases in shelter, energy and food prices, surpassing market expectations. Inflation is hotter than what the Fed, based on its signals, had expected, and is likely to keep increasing, according to El-Erian. 

“If the Fed were truly committed to its 2% inflation target, market participants would be discussing a potential rate hike and not just a longer pause in the cutting cycle,” El-Erian, former CEO of fixed-income management firm PIMCO, said on a [post on X](https://x.com/elerianm/status/1889675183578914888 "post on X") (formerly Twitter). 

“The one qualification, and it's an important one, is that we do not know the extent to which the numbers have been influenced by the one-off factors,” of an annual adjustment to seasonal adjustment factors, updated weights, and the possible impact of wildfires in California, El-Erian, the current economic advisor to Allianz SE, PIMCO’s parent firm, said.

The Fed cut its key rate by 100 basis points in 2024 after inflation trended lower. But in projecting some build-up in price pressures, the Fed paused its rate-cutting campaign in January. 

Fed Chairman Jerome [Powell on Wednesday](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406899-powell-says-fed-has-not-been-in-contact-with-musks-doge-house-hearing "Powell on Wednesday"), in a second-day appearance on Capitol Hill, said the Fed doesn’t need to be in a hurry to adjust its key rate further as its policy stance is significantly less restrictive than it was a few months ago.
