Earnings Call Insights: ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:[ON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON "ON Semiconductor Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* President and CEO Hassane El-Khoury highlighted that full-year 2024 revenue reached $7.1 billion with non-GAAP gross margin at 45.5%. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.72 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin at 45.3% and EPS at $0.95. He emphasized ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, inventory digestion challenges, and demand softness across key end markets.
* Automotive revenue increased 8% sequentially, driven by share gains and new customer ramps, particularly in China, which saw an 18% quarter-over-quarter increase.
* The acquisition of Qorvo’s Silicon Carbide Junction Field Effect Transistor (SiC JFET) business was announced, expected to unlock a $1.3 billion TAM opportunity with a 30% revenue CAGR through 2030.
* CFO Thad Trent reported $1.2 billion in free cash flow for 2024, a threefold increase year-over-year, supported by cost management and capacity planning. He also noted $200 million in Q4 share repurchases, leaving $1.7 billion in remaining authorization.

### Outlook

* Q1 2025 revenue is projected between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion, with non-GAAP gross margin expected to range from 39% to 41%. Non-GAAP EPS is forecasted between $0.45 and $0.55.
* Management anticipates continued volatility due to geopolitical uncertainties and ongoing inventory digestion. Automotive revenue is expected to decline by over 25% sequentially in Q1, with industrial and other segments down mid-to-high single digits.
* Efforts to rationalize manufacturing footprint and portfolio are underway, with expected benefits to gross and operating margins materializing by late 2025.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 automotive revenue was $1.03 billion, up 8% sequentially, while industrial revenue declined 5% to $417 million. Other business revenue dropped 24% quarter-over-quarter.
* Non-GAAP operating expenses were $321 million, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 26.7%. Free cash flow for Q4 increased 39% sequentially to $422 million.
* Inventory levels remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 216 days but include 100 days of bridge inventory for silicon carbide transitions, expected to peak in H1 2025.

### Q&A

* Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank: Asked about structural versus cyclical factors behind demand weakness. Hassane El-Khoury clarified that volatility is mostly tied to the non-core business and reiterated the company’s strategy to exit highly volatile markets.
* Vivek Arya, Bank of America Securities: Inquired about Q1 sequential trends across segments. Thad Trent indicated automotive would see the largest decline, over 25%, while industrial and other segments are expected to decline mid-to-high single digits.
* Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs: Asked about the automotive outlook. El-Khoury attributed Q1 softness to inventory digestion and extended Chinese New Year shutdowns but noted that share gains and ramping programs in China and Europe remain intact.
* Christopher Rolland, Susquehanna: Asked about image sensors. El-Khoury noted stability in the segment, with ongoing shifts toward high-value applications like machine vision and robotics.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism regarding near-term demand visibility, particularly in automotive and industrial end markets. Concerns revolved around inventory digestion and weaker-than-expected EV ramp-ups.
* Management maintained a cautious yet confident tone, emphasizing operational efficiencies and strategic priorities. El-Khoury reiterated, “We remain committed to our long-term strategic goals,” signaling confidence in the company’s resilience.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained consistent, though more defensive when addressing market uncertainties and Q1 guidance.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 2024 revenue of $1.72 billion declined from $1.76 billion in Q3, driven by weakening market demand and inventory digestion. Automotive revenue grew sequentially in both quarters, although growth was more pronounced in Q3.
* Non-GAAP gross margin dipped slightly to 45.3% from 45.5% in Q3. Utilization rates dropped to 59% in Q4, reflecting reduced manufacturing activity, compared to 65% in Q3.
* Management’s tone remained cautious but pivoted toward aggressive structural changes in Q4, with plans to optimize manufacturing and reduce operating expenses.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified geopolitical uncertainties and persistent inventory digestion as significant headwinds. Automotive demand volatility, particularly in EVs, remains a concern, driven by tax credit uncertainties and slowing infrastructure deployment.
* Analysts raised questions about under-utilization and the potential impact on margins, with management emphasizing the need for cost rationalization and portfolio optimization.

### Final Takeaway

ON Semiconductor navigates a challenging macroeconomic environment by focusing on operational efficiency, strategic investments, and long-term growth opportunities in automotive and industrial markets. While near-term demand remains volatile, particularly in automotive, the company’s acquisition of Qorvo’s SiC JFET business and focus on high-margin segments positions it for future profitability. Q1 2025 guidance reflects a cautious outlook, but structural changes are expected to drive margin improvements by late 2025.
