Earnings Call Insights: CT Real Estate Investment Trust ([OTC:CTRRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRRF "CT Real Estate Investment Trust")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Kevin Salsberg, President and CEO, highlighted key metrics with a 3.6% increase in net operating income, 1.7% growth in AFFO per unit for Q4, and a 3% annual increase in AFFO per unit. He emphasized the REIT’s near-full portfolio occupancy rate of 99.4%, its stable balance sheet, and the planned addition of over 600,000 square feet of gross leaseable area in 2025 through its robust development pipeline.
* Salsberg noted the delivery of nearly 500,000 square feet of new gross leaseable area in 2024 through development and acquisitions, totaling $156 million in investments. He also referenced the repurchase of 875,000 units at an average price of $13.50 for $12 million.
* Jodi Shpigel, SVP of Real Estate, outlined three Q4 investments totaling $59 million, including a new 186,000 square foot Canadian Tire store in Kelowna, BC, and the redevelopment of a vacant property in Lloydminster, Alberta. These projects are expected to yield 8.11% and add 284,000 square feet of incremental GLA.
* Lesley Gibson, CFO, reported a 3.6% increase in NOI for Q4, driven by same-property NOI growth of 2% and contributions from development completions. She noted cash distributions increased by 3%, with an AFFO payout ratio at 75%.

### Outlook

* Management plans to add over 600,000 square feet of GLA in 2025 through its development pipeline. Approximately $156 million of committed investments are expected to be spent in the next 12 months.
* The weighted average lease term for the portfolio remains at 7.7 years, with 90% of the development pipeline pre-leased at quarter-end.
* CEO Kevin Salsberg indicated that the composition of 2025 projects would align with conventional store expansions and new developments.

### Financial Results

* Same-store NOI grew 1.5% in Q4, driven by $1.4 million in contractual rent escalations and $0.4 million in property operating expense recoveries. Same-property NOI saw a 2% increase due to intensification projects.
* Diluted FFO per unit increased by 1.2% to $0.3340, while AFFO per unit rose 1.7% to $0.3080.
* The fair value adjustment for Q4 was $54.8 million, primarily due to changes in investment metrics and cash flow assumptions.
* CT REIT maintained a stable indebtedness ratio of 41.1%, and an interest coverage ratio of 3.52x, despite increased interest expenses.

### Q&A

* Lorne Kalmar, Desjardins Capital Markets: Questioned the higher yield of Q4 projects. Kevin Salsberg responded that land lease and redevelopment factors contributed to the 8% yield, which is above the typical range of 6%–6.5%.
* Giuliano Thornhill, National Bank Financial: Asked about the Kelowna acquisition and development pipeline scale. Salsberg highlighted Kelowna’s strong demographics and acknowledged that consumer spending and economic uncertainty may slow new development projects.
* Michael Markidis, BMO Capital Markets: Inquired about the Lloydminster redevelopment. Salsberg explained it involves demising a vacant property into three tenancies, generating incremental NOI.
* Sumayya Syed, CIBC World Markets: Asked about leasing spreads. Jodi Shpigel confirmed that non-Canadian Tire renewals achieved a 10.3% spread, reflecting a supply-constrained market.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about economic uncertainty and the impact on development pipelines. Questions focused on leasing spreads, future projects, and financing strategies, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.
* Management displayed confidence in their prepared remarks, emphasizing stability and growth. However, responses during Q&A were cautious, particularly when addressing tariffs and development slowdowns.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone remained consistent, with management maintaining optimism about long-term strategies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Same-store NOI growth increased slightly from 1.2% in Q3 to 1.5% in Q4.
* Development pipeline commitments rose from $319 million to $328 million, with a higher anticipated spend in the next 12 months.
* AFFO per unit growth decelerated from 2.3% in Q3 to 1.7% in Q4.
* Analysts' focus shifted from broader acquisition activities in Q3 to detailed discussions on project yields and redevelopment in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified higher interest rates as a key risk, with $452 million of maturing debt anticipated to be refinanced at higher rates in 2025.
* Analysts raised concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on leasing decisions and development project delays.
* Management acknowledged slowing capital deployment due to economic uncertainty and consumer spending trends but emphasized flexibility to adapt strategically.

### Final Takeaway

CT REIT delivered stable growth in Q4 2024, supported by strong leasing performance and a robust development pipeline. Management remains focused on leveraging its Canadian Tire relationship to drive long-term value creation. While higher interest rates and economic headwinds pose challenges, the REIT’s low leverage and strategic flexibility position it well for future opportunities.
