The following data is derived from trading activity on the Tradeweb Markets institutional European- and U.S.-listed ETF platforms.

European-Listed ETFs
--------------------

**Total traded volume**

Trading activity on the Tradeweb European ETF marketplace amounted to EUR 67.1 billion in January, the platform’s third best-performing month on record. The proportion of transactions executed via Tradeweb’s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) reached another all-time record of 92.9%, while the percentage of AiEX volume registered at 25.9%.

Adam Gould, Global Head of Equities at Tradeweb, said: “Our European ETF platform had a strong start to the year, both in terms of total traded volume and adoption of automated workflows. AiEX continues to be the automated trading solution of choice for clients looking to optimise and scale their ETF trading activity.”

**Volume breakdown**

All ETF asset classes saw net buying in January and particularly Commodities, where ‘buys’ exceeded ‘sells’ by 30 percentage points. Overall activity in equity-based products increased to 72% of the total platform flow, beating the previous 12-month rolling average by seven percentage points

North America Equities was once again the most heavily traded ETF category, with over EUR 22 billion traded over the month, more than double that of Europe Equities.
