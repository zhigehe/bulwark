Beacon Roofing (NASDAQ:[BECN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BECN "Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.")) was to cut to hold from buy at Stifel as a rival strategic bidder to QXO Inc. ([QXO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO "QXO, Inc.")) seems unlikely. Beacon shares edged lower by ~1% on Friday.

"Though the rejection of QXO’s offer was fully expected, we now view the upside case requiring a strategic acquirer as significantly less likely," Stifel analyst W. Andrew Carter wrote in a note on Thursday.

Carter sees a high probability that QXO can run a successful proxy contest for Beacon Roofing (NASDAQ:[BECN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BECN "Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.")) and worries that the share will like be be "under significant pressure if the offer goes away."

Though Carter sees the fundamental outlook suggesting a $115 target price for Beacon Roofing (NASDAQ:[BECN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BECN "Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.")), the absence of takeover speculation could push BECN shares in the $90s over the near term. Carter last month wrote that he believed BECN [could see rival offers.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4396407-beacon-roofing-may-see-other-takeover-interest-lowes-most-compelling-analyst "could see rival offers.")

QXO late last month [launched a tender offer](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398788-qxo-commences-11b-tender-offer-to-buy-beacon-roofing-supply " launched a tender offer ") to buy Beacon ([BECN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BECN "Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.")) for $124.25 a share. The tender expires on Feb. 24.
