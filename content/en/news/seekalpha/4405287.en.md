OpenAI plans to open a new office in Munich, Germany, as the ChatGPT creator continues to expand its global presence.

Germany currently has the highest number of users, paying subscribers and API developers utilizing OpenAI's artificial intelligence tools, according to the San Francisco-based startup.

"Germany is renowned for its technical expertise, academic excellence and industrial innovation," said OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/germany-trade--invest-openai-expands-to-germany-302371354.html "Sam Altman"). "So it's no surprise it has become a world leader in AI adoption. Opening our first office in Germany means we can help even more people, businesses, institutions benefit from AI's possibilities."

OpenAI has already established European offices in Paris, Brussels and Dublin. Munich has been dubbed the "Silicon Valley of Germany."

Elsewhere in Germany, Altman told students at the Technical University of Berlin on Friday that he's willing to develop a [Stargate Project](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397132-stargate-project-receives-official-announcement-from-trump-openai "Stargate Project") in Europe at some point, according to a report by [Reuters.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openais-altman-envisions-stargate-like-programme-europe-2025-02-07/ "Reuters.")

Stargate is a massive joint venture including Oracle (ORCL), Softbank (SFTBY) and OpenAI. Hardware firms Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) and Arm Holdings ([ARM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARM "Arm Holdings plc")) are also part of the project, which intends to spend up to $500B on the AI infrastructure build out. The companies, as well as other investors, have already pledged $100B for immediate development in the US, to build AI data centers.
