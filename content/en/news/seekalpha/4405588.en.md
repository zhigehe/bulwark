Shares of Lyft (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) traded higher on Monday as *TechCrunch* reported that the ride-hailing company is planning to bring fully autonomous robotaxis, powered by Mobileye (NASDAQ:[MBLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBLY "Mobileye Global Inc.")), to its app possibly by 2026, starting in Dallas.

*TechCrunch* detailed that the plan is to scale to thousands of vehicles across multiple cities after Lyft’s Texas debut. Although it was not clear the number of vehicles Lyft would launch in its Dallas debut. 

Shares of Lyft (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) rose 5% to $14.88, while Mobileye Global (NASDAQ:[MBLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBLY "Mobileye Global Inc.")) shot 11.76% to $17.96 by 0919 ET. 

Additionally, Japanese conglomerate Marubeni is said to own and finance the Mobileye-equipped vehicles that will show up on Lyft’s ride-hailing app. Mobileye ([MBLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBLY "Mobileye Global Inc.")) would serve as the intermediary between Lyft and Marubeni.

Currently, Mobileye's driver assistance technology is present in vehicles made by Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, and General Motors, among others. 

Marubeni will leverage Lyft’s Flexdrive service to help manage its fleet and keep asset utilization high. Flexdrive is Lyft’s service to connect drivers who don’t own vehicles with rental cars, *TechCrunch* added*.*
