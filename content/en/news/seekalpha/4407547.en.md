Earnings Call Insights: Siemens ([OTCPK:SIEGY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIEGY "Siemens Aktiengesellschaft")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Roland Busch highlighted a promising start to fiscal year 2025 with a record €118 billion orders backlog. He emphasized strong performance in Smart Infrastructure and a recovering Digital Industries segment, driven by automation growth and stabilizing demand in China. He noted, "We delivered a promising start into fiscal year 2025, generating clear momentum for continued value creation for our stakeholders."
* Group orders totaled €20.1 billion, with the book-to-bill ratio at 1.09. Orders in Smart Infrastructure were up 5%, while Digital Industries showed recovery with automation orders increasing 6% year-over-year.
* Siemens advanced its ONE Tech Company program, including the acquisition of Altair Engineering to enhance its industrial software business. Regulatory clearance is progressing, with potential closing in the first half of 2025.
* CFO Ralf Thomas reported solid profit of €2.5 billion in Industrial Business and earnings per share pre-PPA of €2.22, excluding a divestment gain. Free cash flow stood at €1.6 billion, reflecting strong cash generation.

### Outlook

* Management confirmed fiscal 2025 guidance, including revenue growth of -6% to +1% for Digital Industries and a profit margin range of 15%-19%.
* For Smart Infrastructure, revenue growth is expected at the upper end of the 6%-9% guidance for Q2, supported by strong order backlog and resilient demand.
* Thomas reiterated expectations for Digital Industries to experience improving trends in the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by the completion of destocking in China and stabilized automation revenue.
* The team targets achieving 50% ARR cloud portion by the end of fiscal 2025, with ARR growth sustained at 14% year-over-year.

### Financial Results

* Group revenue grew by 3%, led by double-digit growth in Smart Infrastructure’s electrification business and strong contributions from the U.S. market, up 17%. Asia and Australia, however, reported a 4% decline due to softness in China.
* Digital Industries' revenue declined 11%, with automation revenue down 19% due to continued destocking. Software revenue increased 15%, supported by growth in the EDA and PLM businesses.
* Smart Infrastructure achieved 8% revenue growth, with the electrification segment up 12%. Operational margins expanded to 16.9%, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of margin improvement.
* Mobility delivered 10% revenue growth, supported by customer services and rolling stock backlog execution.

### Q&A

* Max Yates, Morgan Stanley: Questioned the pipeline for large software orders and potential quarterly fluctuations. CFO Ralf Thomas responded that large orders are hard to predict and emphasized the team’s focus on profitable growth rather than timing-driven deals.
* Ben Uglow, OxCap Analytics: Asked about potential deconsolidation of Siemens Healthineers. CEO Busch clarified that decisions would align with maximizing shareholder value and a strategic update is planned for December.
* Simon Toennessen, Jefferies: Inquired about European DI performance, particularly in Italy. Thomas noted sequential stabilization but highlighted ongoing pricing pressures for European manufacturers.
* Alexander Virgo, Bank of America: Sought clarity on free cash flow drivers. Thomas attributed the strong performance to advanced payments and operational discipline, particularly in Smart Infrastructure.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed skepticism around growth recovery in Digital Industries, with repeated focus on destocking in China and the timing of margin improvements.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives. However, in the Q&A, responses on DI recovery timelines and Healthineers' stake were more cautious.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained consistent, though more defensive when addressing uncertainties in Europe and China.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Compared to Q4 2024, Q1 2025 saw continued challenges in automation revenue, while software growth improved.
* Guidance language remained consistent, reaffirming expectations of a slow start to fiscal 2025 with recovery anticipated in the second half.
* Analysts' focus shifted from large-scale software deals in Q4 to concerns over regional performance and DI’s margin trajectory in Q1.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including tariff impacts and geopolitical tensions.
* Destocking in China remains a key challenge, with normalization expected by the end of Q2 2025.
* Analysts raised concerns about competitive pressures in Europe and the sustainability of data center demand growth.

### Final Takeaway

Siemens delivered a solid start to fiscal 2025, supported by record backlog levels and strong performance in infrastructure and software, despite challenges in automation. The company remains focused on its ONE Tech Company strategy, with growth in digital services and cloud ARR as key priorities. Management reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 guidance while navigating uncertainties in China and Europe.
