HubSpot's (NYSE:[HUBS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS "HubSpot, Inc.")) fourth quarter 2024 financial results surpassed estimates, but its first quarter 2025 revenue guidance fell short of market expectations.

For the quarter ended December 31, HubSpot reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.32, which was more than the consensus estimate of $2.20. Revenue totaled $703.2M, which represented a year-over-year increase of 21%, and was nearly $30M more than market expectations.

However, for the quarter in progress, HubSpot projects revenue ranging from $697M to $699M, which is less than the estimate of $705M. HubSpot expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.74 to $1.76, which was also less than the estimate of $2.01.

HubSpot said full year 2025 revenue will range from $2.99B to $3B, which is basically in line with the street estimate of $3B. Full-year earnings per share will range from $9.11 to $9.19, with a midpoint of $9.15 more than consensus of $9.12.

"2024 was a transformative year for HubSpot as we reimagined our product, our platform, and company with AI," said HubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan. "I'm excited by the progress we've made in embedding AI across our hubs and the value itâ€™s driving for customers. Heading into 2025, we're focused on cementing our position as the leading AI-first customer platform for scaling companies."
