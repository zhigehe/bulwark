**Introduction**
----------------

The Franklin FTSE Australia ETF (NYSEARCA:[FLAU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLAU "Franklin FTSE Australia ETF")), a little-known ETF product (AUM of only $60m) that follows stocks from Australia, has done rather well over the past year. Over the last twelve months, when developed market stocks from the Asia Pacific region have only generated mid-single-digit returns, and the most popular developed market ETF ([VEA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEA "Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF")) has generated returns that are twice as much, FLAU has outperformed them both with returns of over 11%.

If you’re intrigued by this underrated alpha generator, and are contemplating a position in the same, here are some of the important sub-plots to note.

### **How Does FLAU Compare To Its More Popular Peer- EWA?**

Investors are who are interested in tapping the ETF vehicle to gain access to Australian equities are typically always directed to the [iShares MSCI Australia ETF (](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239607/ishares-msci-australia-etf)[EWA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWA "iShares MSCI Australia ETF")), which is more of a tried-and-tested alternative to FLAU. Its superior stature is reiterated by a mammoth listing history of close to 3 decades (whereas FLAU has only been around for less than 8 years), and an AUM profile that is almost 25x larger than our focus ETF!

Even though there’s plenty of overlap between the two products holdings, EWA also tracks a different index- the MSCI Australia Index, whereas FLAU follows the FTSE Australia Capped Index.

While, EWA may be winning the popularity contest, and does offer a few merits, our overall takeaway is that FLAU is the better product of the two. Here’s why.

The most compelling facet of FLAU is its economic superiority; investors who pursue it only need to shed out a very marginal expense ratio of 0.09%. On the other hand, EWA comes at a cost that is almost 5.5x higher than FLAU.

Then, FLAU is also more widespread, covering over 100 stocks, and offering some decent double-digit exposure to high-growth Aussie mid and small-caps. EWA, on the other hand, is narrower, covering only 60 stocks, with limited coverage of mid-caps and below. This facet doesn’t necessarily have to be an issue, if EWA was delivering the goods, but that isn’t quite the case both on a short-term as well as long-term basis.

Note that since FLAU got listed in late 2017, it has been outperforming EWA by over 700bps.

 [![All time returns](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317684849315.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317684849315_origin.png)

Even over the past year, the smaller product has come out on top by over 140bps.

 [![1 year returns](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317695587575.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317695587575_origin.png)

However, total returns may not provide a comprehensive perspective on the risk taken to generate those returns. To ascertain that, one may look at the respective Sharpe ratio readings for the short term as well as long-term.

YCharts





Once again, we can see that FLAU throws up superior Sharpe ratio readings, be it on a 1-year basis or a 5-year basis.

However, it’s not as though FLAU is superior in every aspect. Firstly, investors who also appreciate a healthy dose of income, will view EWA as more promising as its current yield of 3.53% is 35bps better than FLAU’s yield. And while both products don’t resort to a great deal of churn (which can be tax inefficient for a few accounts) with annual turnover rates of single-digits, it is EWA that comes across as slightly more stable with turning over just 5% of its holdings (for FLAU it is 8%).

### **What Do The Macros Look Like?**

As one can see from the image below, GDP growth in Australia has been rather anemic, with the most recent reporting quarter only witnessing 0.8% growth, the weakest since the pandemic year of 2020.

 [![GDP](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317638354068.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317638354068_origin.png) 



Trading Economics





Given the low bar of 2024, the 2025 growth narrative is better positioned to improve (the IMF expects real GDP growth of [2.1%](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/AUS)), and we’re seeing some signs of that now, with an important contributor of growth, domestic consumption, showing some progress. Household spending is now [trending higher](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australia-household-spending-rises-third-straight-month-dec-2025-02-04/) for the third straight month, even as core inflation ([3.2%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australia-household-spending-rises-third-straight-month-dec-2025-02-04/)) is increasingly within reach of the Reserve Bank of Australia ([RBA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBA "RB Global, Inc."))’s target range of 2-3%. What this also means is that there’s an increasingly high probability of the RBA adjusting the cash rate (currently at 4.35%) for the first time in over a year, when it carries out its meeting next month.

While this could continue to fuel domestic condition, it won’t reflect well on the Aussie dollar, which is already not in the best shape on account of tariff risks from the US.

In addition to that, one also ought to be mindful of how damaging rate cuts could be for the net interest margin ([NIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIM "Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund")) profile of Australian banks, which dominate FLAU’s portfolio with a 40% weight. As you can see from the image below, Australia’s largest banks are all poised to deliver rather sub-par net interest margin readings through the next two years.

Besides, that these banks are already facing challenges on the asset quality side on account of the expiry of loan repayment deferrals, and further pressure on asset quality is expected this year, which could end up leaving an inimical mark on their respective ROAs (Return on assets).

### **What Do The Valuations Look Like?**

Over the past year, FLAU may have performed well relative to Asia Pacific based developed market stocks, and the broader developed market universe, but if you’re looking to get in now, it is questionable if the valuation backdrop is favorable, more so in light of the meagre earnings on offer.

Basically, Aussie equities as represented by FLAU are now priced at [19x](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/flau/portfolio) P/E (even EWA is priced at a similar P/E), which is well over a 40% premium over developed markets and Asia Pac specific developed markets. One could perhaps see the logic of paying this premium late-teen multiple, if the weighted average long-term earnings growth of FLAU’s holdings were equally as high, but you’re only going to get a little over mid-single-digits. In contrast, the two developed market ETFs offer superior earnings growth of 9-10%.

**Closing Thoughts- What Do The Charts Suggest?**
-------------------------------------------------

Investors fishing in the Asia Pacific region for beaten stocks that could benefit from mean-reversion are unlikely to take a fancy to FLAU’s holdings as its current relative strength ratio versus other offerings from Asia Pacific is around 8% higher than the long-term mean.

 [![RS ratio](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317662183535.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/9658941-17394317662183535_origin.png)

Separately, take a look at FLAU’s weekly price imprints over the last 1.5 years; until mid-December 2024, FLAU had been progressing within the boundaries of an ascending channel (the two black lines). However, since then, we’ve seen a breakdown from the channel, and a failure to then trade the old channel. Meanwhile, on the daily chart, FLAU still continues to [trade below its 200DMA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLAU/momentum/performance) (Moving average) which doesn’t bode well for a potential long position in the stock as it is vulnerable to selling pressure.
