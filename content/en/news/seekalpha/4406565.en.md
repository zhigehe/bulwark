Crude oil futures climbed to a two-week high Tuesday, as concerns over sanctions on Russian and Iranian oil supplies as well as rising Middle East tensions outweighed worries that a potential trade war could boost inflation and hurt global economic growth.

U.S. sanctions targeting tankers, producers and insurers have caused significant disruptions to shipments of Russian oil to leading importers China and India; Bloomberg reported that Russian output last month [slipped further below its OPEC+ quota](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-gains-lower-russia-233631080.html), and Chinese refiners reportedly are being offered Russian crude at bigger discounts as the sanctions take hold.

President Trump also said Tuesday that Israel should call off its ceasefire agreement with Hamas if hostages are not returned by Saturday, risking another escalation of hostilities; Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the terms of the deal.

"Oil prices, along with many other classes of risk, are entering a phase of guessing," PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans [said](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-gains-lower-russia-233631080.html), referring to possible tariffs. "With the U.S. bearing down on Iranian flows exports and sanctions still biting into Russian flows, Asian crude grades remain firm and underpin the rally from yesterday."

Front-month Nymex crude ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM)) for March delivery closed +1.4% to $73.32/bbl, and front-month April Brent crude ([CO1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM)) finished +1.5% to $77.00/bbl, up for three straight sessions and the highest settlement value for both benchmarks since January 28.

U.S. natural gas futures ([NG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NG1:COM)) rose as colder February weather forecasts raised demand expectations, with the front-month March Nymex contract ending +2.2% to $3.519/MMBtu.

World oil markets are forecast to average a [surplus of 1M bbl/day](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/11/global-oil-glut-seen-expanding-on-stronger-production-growth/) in 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, up from the 800K bbl/day surplus it projected in the previous month's report; the forecast is twice as large as the glut the EIA expects this year, which also was revised up from its prior report.

Driving the projections for the gluts are forecasts that non-OPEC and U.S. oil output will be stronger than previously expected, which may complicate plans by OPEC+ to bring back idled production this year, and that sanctions on Russian crude would not "significantly" affect the country's oil output; Russian flows have only just started to show signs of slowing.

EIA noted the potential for future tariffs and additional Russian sanctions are "sources of uncertainty" for oil prices.
