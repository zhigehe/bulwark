BetMGM (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International"))([OTCPK:GMVHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GMVHF "Entain Plc")) said Super Bowl LIX was the single biggest betting event in the history of the online sports betting operator. The game took in the most bets, and was one of the best single game results in company history. 

While the Eagles winning was the most popular Super Bowl bet, the game was a great result for BetMGM on the futures market.

"Super Bowl bettors cashed in on the Eagles money line and Jalen Hurts Super Bowl MVP, but both defenses slowing down Saquon Barkley and Travis Kelce netted a great result for us," noted BetMGM Senior Trading Manager Christian Cipollini.

The Super Bowl also featured a lower percentage of proposition bets and parlays hitting for bettors in comparison to last year.

On Wall Street, Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon said a major silver lining coming for DraftKings (NASDAQ:[DKNG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKNG "DraftKings Inc.")), FanDuel (NYSE:[FLUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLUT "Flutter Entertainment plc")) and BetMGM (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) ([OTCPK:GMVHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GMVHF "Entain Plc")) is from customer acquisition and NFL growth in new demographics.

"Longer-term, we view the Super Bowl result as a major positive for sportsbooks as it relates to customer acquisition. Super Bowls are always great events for acquiring new customers, but with Super Bowl LIX likely setting viewership records, partly driven by over 60% of the US population now having access to OSB in addition to strong side stories (Taylor Swift and Trump's involvement), we view Super Bowl LIX as unequivocally positive for the NFL and sportsbooks," noted Beynon.

Looking ahead, the most bet on teams in the futures market at BetMGM to win next year's Super Bowl are the Detroit Lions (+800), Philadelphia Eagles (+650), Kansas City Chiefs (+750), Cincinnati Bengals (+1800), and Baltimore Ravens (+700).
