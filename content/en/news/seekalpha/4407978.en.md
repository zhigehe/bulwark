He noted the best-ever quarter for fiber net additions of 57,000, a 22% year-over-year increase, and 40,000 mobile line net additions, marking the strongest performance in five years.
* Mathew emphasized new hyper-local pricing pilots in competitive markets as a significant growth driver, leading to improved penetration, sales, and revenue. These strategies will be scaled further in 2025.

### Outlook
