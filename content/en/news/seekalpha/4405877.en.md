Earnings Call Insights: NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:[NGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGL "NGL Energy Partners LP Common Units")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* NGL Energy Partners executed several strategic initiatives in Q3, including the sale of 17 natural gas liquids terminals and an additional Green Bay terminal, generating total proceeds of approximately $95 million. CFO Brad Cooper noted, "We anticipate closing both transactions by March 31."
* The company is winding down its biodiesel marketing business, which negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $12.1 million in the quarter. The exit is projected to reduce annual working capital needs by $30 million to $40 million.
* The LEX II project commenced operations in October and is performing as expected, according to management.
* The company purchased 92% of outstanding warrants for $6.9 million, eliminating potential future dilution to LP unitholders.
* CEO Mike Krimbill stated, "Exiting the biodiesel business and selling substantially all of our wholesale propane business will improve the repeatability of our cash flows and reduce the seasonality and volatility of our adjusted EBITDA."

### Outlook

* The company updated its fiscal 2025 full-year EBITDA guidance to $620 million, reflecting additional weakness in the Liquids Logistics segment.
* Management highlighted expected growth in the Crude Oil Logistics segment, with new contracts potentially increasing volumes on the Grand Mesa pipeline to 100,000 barrels per day.
* CFO Brad Cooper stated, "We currently project an undrawn ABL balance at March 31st," indicating plans to deploy asset sale proceeds toward balance sheet improvements.

### Financial Results

* Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $147.7 million, compared to $151.7 million in Q3 of the prior year. Excluding the biodiesel impact, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $160 million, representing a 5% year-over-year increase.
* Water Solutions adjusted EBITDA increased to $132.7 million, with physical water disposal volumes rising to 2.62 million barrels per day, a 10% year-over-year increase.
* Crude Oil Logistics adjusted EBITDA was $17.4 million, with Grand Mesa pipeline volumes averaging approximately 61,000 barrels per day.
* Liquids Logistics adjusted EBITDA declined to $8.2 million, impacted by the biodiesel segment's $12.1 million negative EBITDA. Excluding biodiesel, Liquids Logistics contributed $20.3 million.

### Q&A

* Derrick Whitfield, Texas Capital: "How should we think about the annual run rate EBITDA of your remaining assets in Liquids Logistics following these transactions?" Brad Cooper: "Between biodiesel and the wholesale transaction, it's probably 15% to 20% of our EBITDA in that business unit historically."
* James Spicer, TD Securities: "What metrics are you looking for to hit before you start addressing the principal on the Series D preferreds?" Brad Cooper: "Assuming all the assets go straight to the ABL, I think it's probably just continued deleveraging."
* James Spicer, TD Securities: "What assets are left in the Liquids Logistics business now post these divestitures?" Brad Cooper: "Ambassador, Chesapeake, Port Hudson, and a terminal in West Point, Virginia."
* Derrick Whitfield, Texas Capital: "Should we think about volume declines in logistics as seasonal?" Doug White: "Typically, we see a slowdown over the holidays, but we’re already seeing those numbers quickly turn back around in the first calendar quarter of the year."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the impact of asset divestitures and future EBITDA guidance. Questions also reflected concerns over seasonal factors and liquidity improvements.
* Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, highlighting strategic progress and deleveraging efforts. However, responses in the Q&A displayed some defensiveness, with phrases like "I think it's too early for us to give any numbers" and "we don’t want to mislead you."
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts appeared more focused on asset sales and their implications, while management's tone remained consistent, emphasizing strategic clarity and balance sheet improvements.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for fiscal 2025 EBITDA was revised downward to $620 million, compared to the prior quarter's range of $640 million to $650 million.
* Strategic focus shifted further toward exiting non-core businesses, including biodiesel and wholesale propane, to improve cash flow stability.
* Analysts' questions in the current quarter emphasized specifics of asset sales and future EBITDA contributions, compared to broader operational queries in the prior quarter.
* Management's confidence in Water Solutions remained steady, but expectations for Liquids Logistics have been tempered.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about the profitability and growth trajectory of the Crude Oil Logistics and Liquids Logistics segments following recent divestitures.
* Management acknowledged weather-related seasonality and operational slowdowns in the Water Solutions segment during Q3 but expressed optimism for recovery in Q4.
* Potential risks include delays in asset sales, continued underperformance in the Liquids Logistics segment, and variability in Grand Mesa pipeline volumes.

### Final Takeaway

NGL Energy Partners LP is advancing its strategic transformation by divesting non-core assets and exiting volatile businesses like biodiesel to stabilize cash flows and reduce debt. With an updated EBITDA target of $620 million for fiscal 2025, the company is focused on growth in its Water Solutions and Crude Oil Logistics segments, supported by new contracts and improved operational efficiencies. However, challenges in Liquids Logistics and the execution of asset sales remain key risks to monitor.
