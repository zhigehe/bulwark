Earnings Call Insights: Powell Industries (NASDAQ:[POWL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL "Powell Industries, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* Powell Industries reported a strong start to fiscal 2025, with revenue growth of 24% and new order growth of 36% compared to the prior year. The oil and gas sector revenue increased by 14%, while the electric utility and commercial and other industrial sectors saw growth of 26% and 80%, respectively. A notable $75 million award for a domestic LNG project contributed to these results.
* CEO Brett Cope highlighted the strength of the company's $1.3 billion backlog, which increased by $48 million year-over-year and $14 million sequentially. This backlog provides revenue visibility into fiscal 2027, with nearly one-third attributed to the utility market.
* The company is advancing capacity expansion initiatives. The remediation of the nine acres acquired in July 2024 has increased manufacturing capacity, with expected revenue contributions in fiscal 2025. The electrical products factory expansion in Houston remains on schedule for mid-fiscal 2025.
* CFO Michael Metcalf emphasized that the company's book-to-bill ratio for Q1 was 1.1x and domestic revenues rose 24% to $198 million, while international revenues increased 28% to $44 million. He noted that the company holds $373 million in cash and short-term investments and has no debt.

### Outlook

### Financial Results

* Q1 2025 revenues reached $241 million, up from $194 million in the prior year. Net income was $34.8 million or $2.86 per diluted share, representing a 44% increase year-over-year.
* Gross profit totaled $60 million, with a margin of 24.7%, roughly flat year-over-year but lower sequentially due to seasonal factors and prior quarter project closeouts.
* Cash flow from operations was $37 million, with $2.2 million allocated to capital expenditures for facility improvements.
