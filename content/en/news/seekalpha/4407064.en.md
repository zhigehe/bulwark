U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he had a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in which they agreed to visit each other's countries and start negotiations to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he would be contacting Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to tell him about the call.

"We want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, 'COMMON SENSE.' We both believe very strongly in it," Trump said on his Truth Social service, owned by Trump Media & Technology Group ([DJT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJT "Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.")).

"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now," the U.S. President added.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. Russian news agency Interfax said that Trump and Putin had agreed to an in-person meeting in which they would be discussing "areas of mutual interest" including "the subject of a Ukraine settlement," citing Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov.

Trump's move marks a shift in U.S. strategy towards the conflict, as former President Joe Biden's administration refrained from direct contact with Putin and instead sent financial and military aid to Kyiv.
