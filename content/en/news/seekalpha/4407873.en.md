Earnings Call Insights: Suzano S.A. (NYSE:[SUZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SUZ "Suzano S.A.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Beto Abreu emphasized the company's record sales for Q4 and the full year 2024, supported by operational excellence and the performance of the Ribas mill, which produced 900,000 tons and sold 700,000 tons in 2024. He highlighted a strong EBITDA of R$23.8 billion for 2024 and noted that leverage had reduced to 2.9x in dollar terms.
* Fabio Oliveira, Executive Officer for Paper & Packaging, announced the incorporation of Suzano Packaging U.S., acquired from Pactiv Evergreen, into the results. He noted a 15% year-over-year increase in total sales volume for Q4, driven by this acquisition and higher domestic sales. He highlighted that better pricing and cost synergies are expected to positively impact 2025 results.
* CFO Marcelo Bacci reported that net debt ended at $12.8 billion, with significant cash flow generated despite investments in acquisitions and shareholder returns. He reaffirmed the company's commitment to deleveraging in 2025.

### Outlook

* Management anticipates strong domestic demand for uncoated paper and paperboard in 2025, with continued strength in U.S. paperboard demand. Fabio Oliveira mentioned that better terms renegotiated for commercial contracts in Suzano Packaging U.S. will support improved profitability in 2025.
* Leonardo Grimaldi highlighted a challenging supply scenario for Q1 2025 due to low inventories, scheduled maintenance downtimes, and unexpected events like competitor operational issues. Despite these challenges, he expects a constructive sentiment for pulp prices early in the year.
* Aires Galhardo forecasted cash production costs for 2025 to remain stable compared to Q4 2024, assuming an FX level of R$5.8. He noted that Ribas mill is expected to operate with even better performance post-maintenance.

### Financial Results

* Suzano achieved record sales volumes in Q4 2024, with a 24% quarter-over-quarter increase due to the incorporation of Suzano Packaging sales and higher domestic sales.
* EBITDA for Q4 stood at R$5.7 billion, slightly reduced quarter-over-quarter due to the integration of Suzano Packaging, which is undergoing a turnaround, and lower prices in both domestic and external markets. For the full year, EBITDA reached nearly R$21 billion, a 37% increase supported by higher volumes and favorable FX.
* Net debt increased to $12.8 billion, reflecting investments in acquisitions, but leverage decreased to 2.9x net debt to EBITDA in dollar terms.

### Q&A

* Daniel Sasson, Itau BBA: Questioned whether the new U.S. government policies could impact Suzano's capital allocation. EVP Marcos Assumpção responded that the company’s strategy remains unchanged, emphasizing the U.S. market's robust growth and protection against imports.
* Leonardo Correa, BTG Pactual: Inquired about cash cost guidance for 2025. Aires Galhardo clarified that the expected cash cost for 2025 would be flattish compared to Q4 2024 due to FX effects.
* Lucas Laghi, XP: Asked about the Suzano Packaging turnaround. Fabio Oliveira noted that renegotiated contracts and operational improvements will yield stronger results, particularly in the second half of 2025.
* Marcio Farid, Goldman Sachs: Questioned the decision to reduce production by 4% amid shorter cycles. CFO Marcelo Bacci explained that such decisions are based on market trends and remain flexible.
