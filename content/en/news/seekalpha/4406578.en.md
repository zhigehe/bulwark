Earnings Call Insights: Exelixis, Inc. (NASDAQ:[EXEL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXEL "Exelixis, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Mike Morrissey highlighted significant momentum in 2024, emphasizing the company's goal of achieving $3 billion in annual cabozantinib (Cabo) revenue by 2030 and $5 billion for zanzalintinib (Zanza) by 2033. Key drivers include expanding Cabo’s indications and advancing Zanza pivotal trials.
* The Cabo franchise delivered strong growth, with Q4 U.S. net product revenues of $515 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. Global Cabo franchise revenues reached $690 million for the same period.
* Morrissey stated, "Our top priority is advancing the Cabo NET indication" with regulatory activities ongoing for the sNDA based on the CABINET Phase III trial. The FDA has set a PDUFA date of April 3, 2025.
* CFO Chris Senner reported Q4 total revenues of $567 million, driven primarily by Cabo's performance. He also noted that the company repurchased $656 million in shares during fiscal year 2024, with $294 million remaining under the current buyback program.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its focus on advancing Zanza pivotal trials, including STELLAR-303, STELLAR-304, STELLAR-305, and the planned STELLAR-311 trial in neuroendocrine tumors. Top-line results from critical trials are expected in the second half of 2025.
* Exelixis projects significant market penetration for Cabo in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), with the oral therapy market in this space estimated at $1 billion in the U.S. by 2025.
* Morrissey reiterated the company’s plan to launch one Zanza indication per year starting in 2026, pending regulatory approvals.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $0.55, compared to analysts’ estimate of $0.49.
* Revenues for the quarter reached $567 million vs. analysts’ estimate of $563.2 million. Cabo product revenues were $515.2 million, supported by strong U.S. growth.
* Operating expenses increased to $403 million in Q4, driven by higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs.
* Cash and marketable securities at year-end totaled $1.75 billion, with a portion allocated to ongoing share repurchase programs.

### Q&A

* Asthika Goonewardene, Truist: Questioned Zanza's differentiation from Cabo. Morrissey emphasized that Zanza pivotal trials are designed to compare against contemporary standards of care and not Cabo.
* Unidentified Analyst, Citi: Asked about launch expectations for Cabo in NETs. EVP PJ Haley stated the team is "launch-ready" and expects rapid adoption due to strong prescriber overlap and positive reception to CABINET data.
* Yaron Werber, TD Cowen: Inquired about capital allocation post-IP litigation. Morrissey explained that Exelixis plans to balance R&D investments, share buybacks, and potential business development opportunities.
* Stephen Willey, Stifel: Asked about the transition of STELLAR-305 into Phase III. Amy Peterson confirmed data maturity would determine progression.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed interest in Zanza’s commercial potential but raised concerns about competition and differentiation from Cabo, especially in RCC. Morrissey reiterated confidence in Zanza’s best-in-class profile and pivotal trial strategy.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing momentum and strategic clarity. Morrissey stated, "We have significant optionality and flexibility to invest in our future."
* During the Q&A, management adopted a more defensive posture when addressing trial designs and regulatory timelines, with Morrissey frequently redirecting questions.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Cabo franchise revenues grew from $478 million in Q3 2024 to $515.2 million in Q4, driven by increased demand and new patient starts.
* Gross-to-net deductions rose slightly in Q4 due to higher co-pay assistance and Medicare Part D expenses, with full-year estimates projected between 29% and 30%.
* Management's tone shifted from addressing IP litigation in Q3 to focusing on regulatory progress and pipeline advancements in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Regulatory approval for Cabo in NETs remains pending, with the PDUFA date set for April 2025. Management noted that final label negotiations with the FDA could impact launch strategy.
* Analysts raised concerns about competition in the oncology space, particularly with existing generic oral therapies and emerging combination treatments.
* Higher operating expenses tied to clinical trials and manufacturing could pressure margins if revenues do not consistently grow.

### Final Takeaway

Exelixis demonstrated strong Q4 2024 performance, driven by robust Cabo revenue growth and strategic advancements in Zanza pivotal trials. The company remains focused on achieving long-term revenue targets, supported by its diversified oncology pipeline and efficient capital allocation strategies. Investors will closely monitor regulatory outcomes for Cabo in NETs and upcoming trial data for Zanza to assess the company's growth trajectory.
