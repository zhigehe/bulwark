Earnings Call Insights: Veru Inc (NASDAQ:[VERU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VERU "Veru Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* Veru highlighted its transformation into a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, with major developments in enobosarm and sabizabulin drug candidates.
* CEO Mitchell Steiner announced positive top-line results for the Phase 2b QUALITY study, demonstrating enobosarm's ability to reduce lean mass loss by 71% and significantly improve fat mass reductions in patients taking semaglutide. This included a greater than 99% mean relative reduction in lean mass loss with the enobosarm 3 mg dose.
* The extension of the Phase 2b study will explore enobosarm's effects on maintaining muscle mass and preventing fat regain after GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment discontinuation. Results are expected in Q2 2025.
* The company sold its FC2 female condom business for $18 million in December 2024 to focus solely on biopharmaceutical development. CFO Michelle Greco stated, "Net proceeds from the sale were approximately $16.4 million after adjustments."
* Veru plans to advance enobosarm into a Phase 3 trial with a 52-week duration to capture long-term benefits, subject to FDA discussions.
* CEO Steiner emphasized a new focus on sabizabulin, targeting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a broad anti-inflammatory agent, citing its lower drug-drug interaction risks compared to colchicine.

### Outlook

* The company plans to present the full clinical efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2b QUALITY study at scientific conferences following the unblinding of the extension study.
* Veru anticipates filing a new IND for sabizabulin to address inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Phase 2 studies using coronary CT angiography as the primary endpoint. IND submission is expected in the first half of 2026.
* A novel modified release oral formulation of enobosarm is under development and is projected to begin Phase 1 trials in the first half of 2025.

### Financial Results

* Research and development expenses rose to $5.7 million, compared to $1.7 million in the prior quarter, driven by costs associated with the Phase 2b QUALITY trial.
* Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $5.2 million from $6.7 million, largely due to lower share-based compensation and reduced headcount.
* The company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.7 million or ($0.08) per diluted share in the prior quarter.
* Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash stood at $26.6 million as of December 31, 2024, up from $24.9 million at the end of the prior quarter.

### Q&A

* **William Wood, B. Riley Securities:** Inquired about the dropout rate in the extension study. Chief Scientific Officer Gary Barnette explained it was 13%, largely due to expected gastrointestinal side effects from GLP-1 receptor agonists.
* **Denis Reznik, Raymond James:** Asked about expectations for the extension trial. CEO Steiner described it as an exploratory study focusing on fat regain prevention, with enobosarm’s ability to maintain muscle as a key factor.
* **Leland Gershell, Oppenheimer:** Queried about including younger populations in future enobosarm trials. Steiner confirmed the potential for including broader age demographics in Phase 3, with a primary focus on patients over 60.
* **Unidentified Analyst, Jefferies:** Asked about combining enobosarm with oral GLP-1 therapies. Steiner noted the feasibility of fixed-dose combinations, emphasizing enobosarm’s potential to enhance GLP-1 therapies by preserving muscle and burning fat.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, focusing on the progress of the enobosarm and sabizabulin programs while seeking clarity on trial timelines and cash sufficiency. Questions reflected interest in the strategic pivot and future trial designs.
* Management displayed confidence during the prepared remarks and Q&A, emphasizing the strength of clinical data and the strategic refocus on biopharmaceutical R&D. CEO Steiner used phrases like "we are extremely excited" and "this is unambiguous" to underline confidence in enobosarm's potential.
* Compared to previous quarters, the tone was more focused on R&D milestones, reflecting a clearer strategic direction following the divestiture of the FC2 business.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* No prior quarter transcript was available for direct comparison. However, management’s tone indicated a stronger focus on advancing clinical trials and optimizing the company's pipeline.
* Analysts concentrated on the implications of recent clinical trial results and the company’s ability to maintain financial stability.
* Strategic priorities have shifted, with Veru now wholly focused on cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases following the sale of its FC2 business.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged the company’s need for additional capital to fund operations beyond the end of 2025, highlighting potential risks in sustaining long-term R&D efforts.
* Analysts raised concerns about trial dropout rates and the potential impact of GLP-1 associated side effects on enobosarm’s success.
* The extension study results and FDA’s response to Phase 3 plans remain pivotal for the company's future trajectory.

### Final Takeaway

Veru Inc. is advancing its late-stage clinical pipeline with promising results from its enobosarm Phase 2b QUALITY study, emphasizing its ability to enhance GLP-1 therapies by preserving muscle and promoting selective fat loss. The company is also exploring sabizabulin as a safer anti-inflammatory agent for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With a narrowed focus on biopharmaceuticals following the sale of its FC2 business, Veru plans to leverage these developments for long-term growth, though capital needs and regulatory milestones remain critical challenges ahead.
