ConocoPhillips (NYSE:[COP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COP "ConocoPhillips")) +0.7% in Monday's trading even as Raymond James downgrades shares to Outperform from Strong Buy with a $124 price target, reduced from $157, following [Q4 results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404317-conocophillips-non-gaap-eps-of-1_98-beats-by-0_15 "Q4 results") that exceeded expectations with earnings coming in ~8% higher than analyst consensus.

Conoco's (NYSE:[COP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COP "ConocoPhillips")) Q4 production also topped the high end of previous guidance, driven by strong results from the Lower 48, which generated 5% Y/Y growth on a standalone basis.

Raymond James analyst John Freeman also noted the initial synergies from the Marathon Oil acquisition become apparent when looking at 2025 capital spending guidance of less than $13B vs. pro forma $13.5B combined capex in 2024, and ConocoPhillips' ([COP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COP "ConocoPhillips")) FY 2025 and Q1 2025 production guidance was roughly in-line with Wall Street.

Freeman says ConocoPhillips ([COP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COP "ConocoPhillips")) remains one of the best run E&P companies with an impressive global asset portfolio, and the stock still screens attractive from a valuation perspective, but the stock lacks a near-term catalyst, prompting the downgrade.
