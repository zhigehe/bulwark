### Management View

* CEO Gary Bhojwani highlighted CNO Financial’s strong quarter and full-year performance, noting that 2024 was one of the company’s most successful years, with records in both Consumer and Worksite divisions.

* Total new annualized premium (NAP) rose 7% for the year, with Medicare Supplement NAP up 26%, and Medicare Advantage policies up 14%. The Consumer Division achieved record sales across multiple product categories, including Medicare Advantage, which saw a 39% increase in submitted policies for the quarter.
* Bhojwani also emphasized the Worksite Division’s growth, reporting record full-year insurance sales up 16%, driven by a 35% contribution from geographic expansion initiatives and 78% growth in NAP from new group clients.
* CFO Paul McDonough reported a 41% year-over-year rise in operating earnings per share in Q4, supported by higher interest rates, investment returns, and disciplined expense management.

### Outlook

* Management expects to achieve a 10.5% operating return on equity ([ROE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROE "Astoria US Quality Kings ETF")) in 2025, an improvement of 50 basis points from 2024, and plans to grow ROE to 11.5% by 2027.
* The company guided 2025 operating earnings per share to a range of $3.70 to $3.90. It anticipates a 2025 expense ratio between 19.0% and 19.4%, with seasonality similar to prior years.
* McDonough detailed a three-year initiative beginning in Q2 2025 to modernize CNO's technology, leveraging AI and cloud solutions. This $170 million program includes $60 million in 2025, which is expected to strengthen long-term growth capabilities.

### Financial Results

* CNO reported a 40% year-over-year increase in operating earnings per diluted share for the full year, with underlying ROE estimated at 10% on a run-rate basis.
* Book value per diluted share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), rose 10% year-over-year to $37.19. Total investment income grew 16% in Q4, with new money rates exceeding 6% for eight consecutive quarters.
* Capital returns to shareholders totaled $349 million in 2024, a 50% increase from 2023, driven by strong free cash flow generation and excess liquidity at the holding company.

### Q&A
