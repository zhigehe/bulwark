The January U.S. consumer inflation report came in hotter than expected and sent traders scrambling to further recalibrate their Federal Reserve rate cut expectations. Wall Street now sees only one quarter-point cut in 2025.

Both the headline and core consumer price index (CPI) [posted](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406789-inflation-heats-up-more-than-expected-in-january-cpi "posted") their highest M/M readings in January 2025 since March last year. The rise was driven by surging shelter and food prices, with egg prices in particular [skyrocketing](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406763-cpi-read-food-inflation-runs-below-overall-cpi-despite-skyrocketing-egg-prices "skyrocketing") due to an ongoing outbreak of bird flu.

According to the CME FedWatch tool, market participants now see only one 25 basis point rate cut in 2025:

As can be seen, the odds of the central bank holding the federal funds rate steady at its current level of 4.25%-4.50% has ticked up to ~31% after Wednesday's CPI report, compared to about 20% a day ago.

Inflation had begun to trend lower in 2024, prompting the Fed to finally begin a monetary policy easing cycle in September and lowering the federal funds rate by 100 basis points until the end of the year. But a spate of strong inflation reports recently caused the Fed to take a pause last month.

"Today's Core CPI data reinforces our view that the Fed will not be cutting interest rates further this year. While we do believe January seasonality is once again at play here, this data reaffirms that inflation will likely remain stubbornly high, above the Fed's target for the time being. Given this, and a currently resilient labor market, we think the Fed will not cut rates further any time soon," Rick Rieder, CIO of global fixed income at BlackRock, said on X (formerly Twitter).
