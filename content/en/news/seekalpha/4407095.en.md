Ford (NYSE:[F](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F "Ford Motor Company")) executives warned about the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy during an appearance this week at a Wolfe Research auto tech conference.

CFO Sherry House said the automaker is looking at material flows, inventory levels, commodities, and even considering damaging Tier 2 and Tier 3 effects with suppliers. With the Mexico and Canada tariffs still on pause, Ford (NYSE:[F](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F "Ford Motor Company")) is not making many large decisions until the resolution is clearer. 

For his part, CEO JIm Farley noted that the speculative aspect of the market means prices and costs sometimes push higher just because tariffs are even rumored.

"So far, what we're seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos. If you look at the tariffs, let's be real honest, long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border would blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen."

Farley thinks the development gives free rein to South Korean, Japanese, and European companies that are bringing 1.5 million to 2 million vehicles into the U.S. that wouldn't be subject to the discussed Mexican and Canadian tariffs. He called it potentially one of the biggest windfalls for those companies ever. "Meanwhile, we're USMCA complying with almost all of our content, finished vehicles and components going across the borders to have that kind of size of the tariff would be devastating," he added.

Investors may agree with Farley.
