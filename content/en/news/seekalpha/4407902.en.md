Earnings Call Insights: Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:[HTZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTZ "Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Wayne West, CEO, outlined the company's progress in implementing significant foundational changes and highlighted the "Back to Basics" roadmap focused on fleet, revenue, and cost management. Over 60% of Hertz's fleet now consists of vehicles one year old or less, with a goal to complete the fleet rotation by year-end 2025.
* The company sold 100,000 vehicles in Q4 2024, utilizing both wholesale and retail channels, with an emphasis on growing the retail channel through partnerships and digital enhancements.
* Hertz introduced new senior leadership, including Chris Berg as Chief Administrative Officer and Doria Holbrook as EVP of Mobility, to strengthen the company's transformation efforts.
* CFO Scott Haralson reported Q4 revenue of just over $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA loss of $357 million. He emphasized the company's disciplined fleet management and cost control, stating, "We still expect to exit the year at our target of below $300 a month per unit."

### Outlook

* Management stated that the company aims to achieve a sub-$300 DPU by the end of 2025, supported by lower depreciation costs from newer vehicle purchases, enhanced retail sales channels, and seasonal demand patterns.
* Revenue and EBITDA guidance remain directional, with an expected seasonal EBITDA loss in Q1 2025, breakeven in Q2, and a sizable EBITDA profit in Q3. The company anticipates a low single-digit EBITDA margin for the year.
* CEO Wayne West reiterated confidence in completing the fleet rotation, stating, "We are turning our fleet from a headwind to a tailwind for the business."

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue of just over $2 billion compared to analysts’ revenue estimate of $2.13 billion. Adjusted EBITDA loss stood at $357 million.
* Fleet utilization improved by 270 basis points quarter-over-quarter despite similar seasonal demand patterns.
* Depreciation per unit (DPU) for Q4 ended higher than the guided range of $350 to $375 due to wholesale vehicle sales during a seasonally softer period and lower-than-forecast MMR values.
* Operating expenses reflected declines in labor, maintenance, collision, and supply chain costs year-over-year, although insurance reserves and lease liabilities impacted overall cost structure.
* Liquidity remained robust at $1.8 billion, with $500 million raised through new senior secured notes to support fleet rotation and operational plans.

### Q&A

* John Babcock, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, asked about metrics to gauge progress. Wayne West responded, emphasizing the importance of achieving sub-$300 DPU and improving utilization through process efficiencies and retail channel expansion.
* Chris Woronka, Deutsche Bank, inquired about long-term margin targets. CFO Scott Haralson pointed to the company’s North Star metrics of RPU above $1,500, DOE in the low $30s, and sub-$300 DPU as guideposts.
* Dan Levy, Barclays, raised concerns about the impact of competitor fleet rotations. Scott Haralson reassured that Hertz is well-positioned with locked-in favorable economics for its model year 2025 purchases and a diversified supply chain.
* Harold Antor, Jefferies, queried about vehicle disposal strategies. Wayne West emphasized the shift toward higher-margin retail sales channels, stating less than 10% of vehicles are now sold through auctions.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts focused on operational progress but pressed on EBITDA losses and liquidity concerns. Tone was neutral to slightly negative, with skepticism around long-term margin improvement.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks but was more defensive in Q&A, particularly when addressing DPU performance and liquidity strategies.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts showed increased concern over competitive pressures and cash flow management, while management demonstrated consistent confidence in achieving strategic goals.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language for DPU improved, with a firmer commitment to sub-$300 levels by year-end 2025 compared to prior expectations of low $300s.
* Strategic focus shifted more prominently toward retail car sales and operational execution, with new leadership hires reinforcing these priorities.
* Analysts continued to press on fleet rotation and liquidity but showed heightened interest in competitive positioning and demand trends.
* Management's confidence in achieving fleet rotation and cost targets remained steady, while analysts displayed more skepticism compared to Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Challenges include lower-than-expected vehicle residual values and the need to optimize retail sales channels.
* Insurance costs and lease liability accounting changes are expected to remain headwinds into 2025.
* Analysts raised concerns over the impact of competitor fleet rotations and the company's ability to sustain liquidity during ongoing fleet investments.

### Final Takeaway

Hertz Global Holdings emphasized its progress in fleet rotation and cost management while targeting a sub-$300 DPU by year-end 2025. Despite reporting an adjusted EBITDA loss and lower-than-anticipated Q4 revenue, management expressed confidence in its strategic initiatives, including retail car sales expansion and operational efficiencies.
