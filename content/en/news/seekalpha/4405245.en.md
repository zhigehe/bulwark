Earnings Call Insights: Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE:[KIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KIM "Kimco Realty Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Conor Flynn highlighted significant leasing momentum driven by favorable supply-demand dynamics, emphasizing the company's strategic focus on first-ring suburbs with high barriers to entry. He announced that Kimco achieved its goal of entitling 12,000 apartment units a year ahead of schedule, bolstering its mixed-use portfolio.
* Flynn noted that internet-resistant service providers now account for over 50% of new lease volume, with categories like health, wellness, and quick-service restaurants driving traffic.
* CFO Glenn Cohen reported fourth-quarter FFO at $286.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share, up from $0.39 per share in Q4 2023. Total pro-rata NOI increased 17.8%, supported by acquisitions and higher minimum rents.
* President Ross Cooper detailed the successful integration of the RPT Realty acquisition, which contributed $38.1 million to NOI and included improved cost synergies of 13%, totaling $36 million.

### Outlook

* Management's FFO per share guidance for 2025 is set at $1.70–$1.72, representing growth of 3–4.2%.
* The 2025 same-property NOI growth is projected at 2% plus, with credit loss assumptions between 75–100 basis points due to recent tenant bankruptcies.
* Acquisition plans include $100–$125 million of investments, net of dispositions, with a focus on recycling capital from flat-growth assets and monetizing select development entitlements.
* Cohen highlighted a robust leasing pipeline, expecting $25 million in rent from signed-but-not-open leases to commence in 2025.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter same-site NOI growth was 4.5%, driven by higher minimum rents and lower credit loss, while full-year 2024 same-site NOI grew by 3.5%.
* Year-end portfolio occupancy stood at 96.3%, with a slight sequential decline offset by a 10 basis point year-over-year increase.
* The signed-but-not-open pipeline compressed to 270 basis points, representing $56 million in potential future base rent.
* The company raised $136.3 million through its ATM program and successfully tendered over 22% of its 7.25% Class N preferred stock, reducing the liquidation preference to $71.9 million.

### Q&A

* Michael Goldsmith, UBS: Asked about credit loss assumptions and visibility into troubled tenants. COO David Jamieson noted bids are being collected for vacated locations, with robust demand from grocery, off-price, and service tenants to backfill spaces.
* Craig Mailman, Citi: Inquired about acquisition opportunities and funding sources. Cooper stated that ground lease dispositions and entitlement monetizations will match fund acquisitions, with selective focus on core investments.
* Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs: Asked about the tight FFO guidance range. Cohen explained it reflects a clean forward-looking year with minimal one-time impacts, providing confidence in the $0.02 range.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed neutral to slightly positive sentiment, focusing on Kimco's ability to backfill vacancies and achieve guidance amid tenant bankruptcies. Questions highlighted cautious optimism, particularly around acquisitions and credit loss projections.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing leasing momentum and strategic achievements. However, they adopted a more measured stance during Q&A, particularly regarding credit loss and acquisition funding.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was consistent, reflecting steady performance and confidence in growth initiatives.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Same-site NOI growth was slightly lower in Q4 (4.5%) compared to Q3 (3.3%), driven by higher rent commencements and improved leasing activity.
* The RPT acquisition continued to outperform, contributing significantly to NOI growth and boosting small shop occupancy by 50 basis points.
* Analysts in Q4 focused more on credit loss assumptions and acquisition funding compared to Q3, where questions were centered on leasing spreads and structured investments.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management flagged tenant bankruptcies, including Big Lots and Joann’s, which could impact occupancy and credit loss projections. Jamieson detailed ongoing efforts to backfill vacated spaces with higher-credit tenants.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential downside risks to same-site NOI growth and credit loss exceeding guidance assumptions.
* Management highlighted the lack of new retail supply as a mitigating factor, providing opportunities to increase rents and enhance tenant quality.

### Final Takeaway

Kimco Realty demonstrated strong operational performance in Q4 2024, supported by robust leasing momentum and strategic portfolio repositioning in high-demand markets. Management's confident FFO and NOI guidance for 2025 reflects the company's ability to navigate tenant bankruptcies and leverage its mixed-use and grocery-anchored portfolio for sustained growth. While analysts remain cautious about credit loss risks, Kimco's disciplined capital allocation and recycling strategies position it for continued success in 2025.
