BP (NYSE:[BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) said Tuesday it expects its Whiting refinery in Indiana will [run at full capacity this year](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202502119130/bp-expects-indiana-refinery-to-run-at-capacity-in-2025-after-major-4q-work-opis "run at full capacity this year") after completing a major maintenance turnaround during Q4.

Work done at the 440K bbl/day refinery during the quarter included replacing a coker unit; the refinery shut down in early February 2024 after a power outage and did not resume operations until mid-March.

After a challenging year for refining operations due to low margins and refined product prices in the U.S. and Europe, BP (NYSE:[BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) is planning to carry out less maintenance work at its refiners in 2025, CEO Martin Auchincloss said on the company's [earnings conference call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757010-bp-p-l-c-bp-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "earnings conference call").

The CEO said BP ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) is aiming to improve the company's refinery utilization to 96% in 2025, up from 94.3% in 2024, after utilization hit 96.1% in 2023.

Auchincloss said the company should have fewer complicated turnarounds at its other refineries this year, and maintenance work should be heavily weighted toward the year's H1 with the largest impact occurring in Q2.

In response to a question about the impact of possible tariffs on U.S. imports of crude oil from Canada and Mexico, Auchincloss said BP ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) could send oil north from the Gulf Coast to supply Midwest refiners, which rely heavily on Canadian oil, but added that it is difficult to predict how tariffs could affect refining margins given uncertainties over crude oil flows.

BP ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) closed +0.4% on Tuesday despite reporting a [sharp Y/Y decline](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406027-bp-ceo-pledges-fundamental-reset-as-q4-profit-drops-60 "sharp Y/Y decline") in Q4 earnings.
