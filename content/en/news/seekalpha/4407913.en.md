The S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) is coming off back-to-back 20% plus return years and Wells Fargo says a three-peat is unlikely even as the financial institution still holds a bullish stance on the overall market.

“Do we expect an S&P 500 Index three-peat in 2025? In short, no,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist of Wells Fargo stated. Wren went on to add: “Our 6,600 year-end target for the SPX would represent an approximate 12% gain from the December 31, 2024, market close.

Despite a long-shot for 20% return hat-trick, Wells Fargo echoed that market participants should be optimistic as it forecasts strong economic growth this year along with consumers continuing to spend as the unemployment rate stays below the long-term historical average.

As of Thursday, the benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) is up on the year by 3% through the first month and a half of 2025. Moreover, the index is off its all-time high of 6,128.18 by 0.7%, which was observed back on January 24.

Also, from a more momentum and technical approach, of the 500 stocks that sit inside of the S&P 500, 259 trade above their respective 50-day moving average and a total of 24 names sit in overbought territory in accordance of the relative strength index technical indicator and another 42 stocks are listed as overbought according to the RSI.
