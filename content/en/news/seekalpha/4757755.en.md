January was a month for the ages. Yet as I write this, there is another cold spell that is affecting millions of people. Antero Resources (NYSE:[AR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR "Antero Resources Corporation")) benefits from those cold spells because they help to decrease the amount of natural gas in storage. The way this winter is going, the decrease in natural gas could be significantly above normal if the unusually cold winter spells continue.

Natural Gas Pricing History
---------------------------

Clearly, natural gas prices began responding to the winter demand in December.

Antero Resources Presentation Of Natural Gas Pricing History (Antero Resources Presentation Of Natural Gas Pricing Update February 2025)



[Usually, natural gas](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c50f698878066e4e7264f72959ccc0ad/anteroresources/db/819/7651/pdf/Weekly+Pricing+Update+02-10-25_v1.pdf "https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c50f698878066e4e7264f72959ccc0ad/anteroresources/db/819/7651/pdf/Weekly+Pricing+Update+02-10-25_v1.pdf") prices peak in January because that is also when demand for natural gas seasonally peaks. The fact that December prices appear to be generally stronger than they were in the first quarter is a good omen for the fiscal 2025 first quarter report.

There is still a fairly long way to go until the end of the first quarter. When it comes to the weather, the possibilities are unlimited. However, La Ni単as, even weak La Ni単as, are known for cold spells. So, the first quarter has a better than usual possibility of being one that could be remembered for some time to come. By most accounts it is off to a good start.

Export Capacity
---------------

What helps to keep storage levels down is all the export capacity that is scheduled to come online. There is also talk of data centers needing natural gas to generate electricity, but timing of this seems to be a bit more uncertain. Additional considerations adding to the bullish outlook for natural gas pricing include growth in exports of natural gas to Mexico and the use of natural gas to generate electricity (especially in the summer months).

Antero Resources Guidance On Export Demand Growth (Antero Resources Presentation Of Natural Gas Fundamentals)



[Already, a significant amount o](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a73c48f14a5e54a9b46630f3f7bed4dc/anteroresources/db/732/7634/pdf/Antero+Natural+Gas+Fundamentals+January+25_vF.pdf "https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a73c48f14a5e54a9b46630f3f7bed4dc/anteroresources/db/732/7634/pdf/Antero+Natural+Gas+Fundamentals+January+25_vF.pdf")f export capacity came online towards the end of fiscal year 2024. There is a little bit more coming online in fiscal year 2025. By and large this area of demand growth is probably the most significant of all the possibilities under discussion. As shown above, there are plenty of approved projects already underway.

The issue here is that North America could end up joining the far stronger world pricing market through all the uses of natural gas that are projected to grow. But the voters are already upset with high prices. There is a possibility that the projects not yet approved may be delayed so that United States citizens can continue to enjoy lower natural gas prices than the rest of the world.

Antero Resources Pricing
------------------------

Antero Resources already enjoys a significant advantage over many producers because the company exports natural gas (and it has long before it was even a thought for many competitors).

Antero Resources Fourth Quarter Commodity Prices Received (Antero Resources Fourth Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release)



[As competitors report prices received](https://www.anteroresources.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/243/antero-resources-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-results "https://www.anteroresources.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/243/antero-resources-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-results"), I would expect the natural gas prices shown above will be among the highest in the industry. Texas has such a surplus of natural gas that those producers can usually only dream of prices like the ones shown above.

The export prices received for (primarily) butane and propane make a good situation that much better. As a result, this company usually will post some of the top prices for products sold in the United States.

A weaker spot is usually the price of oil and sometimes ethane as well because the basin where Antero Resources operates is primarily a natural gas basin. Therefore, the company often does not get the best prices for oil because there is not much local demand for the oil produced in a natural gas basin. It also has to do with the relative quality of the oil produced as well.

Ethane is a different situation in that companies will leave ethane in the natural gas stream if prices are low enough. There is a lot more ethane that can be produced than is actually produced and sold as a result.

Profits Rise
------------

Because the costs are fully paid for when natural gas prices were lower, profits rose because only a few costs will increase with the increase in commodity prices. The net result is that the extra money largely flows to the bottom line with only a few deductions along the way.

Antero Resources Summary Of Prices And Costs Per MCF (Antero Resources Fourth Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release)



As expected probably the most significant cost increase was the taxes on the added value of the production. Since earnings are a fraction of revenue, the price increases had a material effect on profits reported.

As a result, this is one of a few natural gas producers that reported more free cash flow in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year than in the last fiscal year.

Antero Resources Fourth Quarter 2024, Free Cash Flow Calculation (Antero Resources Fourth Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release)



The rather sizable free cash flow reported in the quarter allowed the whole fiscal year to report free cash flow. This was a year that many companies had a tough time reporting natural gas profits let alone free cash flow.

Summary
-------

The company is heading towards a very good first quarter 2025. Oftentimes, the companies that do the best when natural gas prices are high are the same ones with profit leading performances with natural gas prices are low.

This La Ni単as winter is so far exceeding expectations with February still sending cold air South. That is bullish for natural gas producers.

Now a La Ni単as year is also known for hot summers that could also increase natural gas demand to generate electricity for the air conditioning needed. But that is far from guaranteed.

#### 2025 Guidance

Fiscal year 2025 guidance would appear to be largely "more of the same" with the emphasis on at least maintaining the cost progress made in fiscal year 2024.

 [![Antero Resources Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/1102834-17394153815495617.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/1102834-17394153815495617_origin.png) 



Antero Resources Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance (Antero Resources Fourth Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release)



Despite the forecast above, management will likely continue to work to reduce some of the well costs assumed for the capital budget. But the biggest item to note is all those premiums that management is guiding to compared to benchmarks. That really demonstrates top notch management because I will be reporting a lot of guidance that discounts compared to the benchmark.

Management has to plan transportation well ahead of time to allow for the flexibility to send production to premium markets because that strategy can change somewhat from one year to the next. Clearly this management has planned that very well to continue forecasting a fair number of premium prices to benchmarks.

This reinforces the strong buy recommendation. Antero Resources is likely to be a prime beneficiary of any cold spell due to the transportation flexibility constantly exhibited by this management. In addition, if there are stronger prices to be had, this management is usually first in line to get them.

As a result, this company should be a big beneficiary in the future of the bullish outlook for natural gas prices.

Risks
-----

Any upstream company is subject to the low visibility and volatility of commodity prices. This management is well known for getting natural gas to premium markets. However, even here, a severe and sustained downturn of commodity prices could materially change the company's future outlook.

Much of the success of the company is likely due to the founders. One of those founders retired a couple of years ago. When the time comes for the other founder to retire, this could be a very different company going forward.

The marketing strategy (as shown by the ability to get the production to strong pricing markets) is unmatched by all but a few competitors I follow. However, there is no guarantee that the superior pricing performance will continue in the future.
