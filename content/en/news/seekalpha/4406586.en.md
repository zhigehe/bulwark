Earnings Call Insights: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:[SMCI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI "Super Micro Computer, Inc.")) Q2 2025

### Management View

* Charles Liang, CEO, highlighted preliminary Q2 net revenue in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion, a 54% year-over-year increase. He noted strong demand for AI platforms and the transition from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs as key growth drivers.
* Liang announced that NVIDIA Blackwell products are shipping, including air-cooled and liquid-cooled GPU systems. Super Micro aims to expand its Datacenter Building Block Solutions to provide end-to-end data center services, reducing total cost of ownership for customers.
* The company issued $700 million in convertible senior notes to support business growth and emphasized its strategic expansions in Malaysia, Taiwan, Europe, and the U.S. to meet increasing product demand.
* CFO David Weigand confirmed that AI-related platforms contributed over 70% of Q2 revenue. He noted that non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 11.9% and operating margin was 7.9%, reflecting temporary margin pressures from product mix and R&D investments.

### Outlook

* Liang projected FY2025 revenue between $23.5 billion and $25 billion, down from the previous guidance of $26 billion to $30 billion, citing delays in new technology rollouts and customer behavior.
* For Q3 FY2025, the company expects net sales between $5 billion and $6 billion, with gross margin approximately 12%.
* Liang expressed confidence in achieving $40 billion revenue for FY2026, supported by increased production capacity and strong customer engagements for new GPU platforms.

### Financial Results

* Preliminary Q2 FY2025 non-GAAP earnings were $0.58 to $0.60 per share, compared to $0.56 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income ranged from $375 million to $392 million.
* Closing inventory decreased from $4.9 billion to $3.6 billion, while cash at the end of the quarter stood at $1.4 billion, down from $2.1 billion in Q1.
* Operating cash flow saw a decline, with $240 million cash used, compared to $409 million generated in Q1.

### Q&A

* Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs: Inquired about the $40 billion FY2026 revenue target. Liang stated that production capacity remains underutilized, with ample room for growth in the U.S., Taiwan, and Malaysia.
* Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital: Asked about gross margins through the Blackwell cycle. Liang emphasized that new products typically yield better margins and noted growing adoption of liquid cooling solutions, which offer competitive advantages.
* Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan: Raised concerns about revenue visibility during GPU transitions. Liang confirmed strong customer engagements, particularly for Blackwell platforms, and highlighted increased focus on Europe and Asia.
* Quinn Bolton, Needham & Company: Queried backlog trends for Blackwell products. Liang confirmed growing customer interest and readiness to scale production once GPU supply increases.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts displayed cautious optimism but pressed for clarity on Blackwell GPU timelines and financial reporting delays. Concerns about 10-K delays and their impact on customer confidence were prominent.
* Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic initiatives and long-term growth opportunities. However, during Q&A, they acknowledged challenges related to supply chain constraints and financial reporting.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management demonstrated similar confidence in product readiness but faced heightened scrutiny from analysts regarding financial controls and guidance adjustments.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue guidance for FY2025 was revised downward from $26 billion-$30 billion to $23.5 billion-$25 billion due to delays in Blackwell GPU availability and customer purchasing behavior.
* Gross margin decreased from 13.3% in Q1 to 11.9% in Q2, reflecting product mix and R&D investments.
* Analysts maintained a consistent focus on GPU transitions, liquid cooling adoption, and financial reporting issues, mirroring concerns from the previous quarter.
* Management's tone remained optimistic about long-term growth, but investor concerns about near-term execution intensified.

### Risks and Concerns

* Financial reporting delays and associated market perception risks were highlighted as challenges. The company aims to file its 10-K and 10-Qs by February 25, 2025.
* Supply chain constraints for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs could limit near-term revenue growth despite strong customer demand.
* Competitive pressures in the AI server market and pricing dynamics for liquid cooling solutions may impact margins.

### Final Takeaway

Super Micro Computer remains focused on leveraging its technological leadership and expanding production capacity to meet growing AI demand. While Blackwell GPU rollouts and liquid cooling adoption present significant opportunities, supply chain constraints and financial reporting delays pose near-term challenges. Managementâ€™s confidence in achieving $40 billion revenue by FY2026 underscores its commitment to long-term growth.
