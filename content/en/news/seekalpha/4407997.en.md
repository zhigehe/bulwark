Earnings Call Insights: Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:[IRDM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRDM "Iridium Communications Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Matt Desch highlighted a strong finish to 2024, with operational EBITDA exceeding full-year projections and more than $300 million in free cash flow generated. He noted that Iridium returned approximately $140 million to shareholders in Q4 through dividends and an expanded share repurchase program, retiring over 4 million shares in the quarter.
* Desch emphasized Iridium’s differentiation from competitors like Starlink, stating that Iridium focuses on safety and mission-critical applications and operates on a different spectrum, providing reliability that competitors cannot fulfill.
* CFO Vincent O'Neill reported Q4 operational EBITDA of $117 million, up 3% year-over-year, and total revenue of $213 million, up 9%. He noted the contribution of service revenue growth, equipment demand recovery, and expanded government contracts.
* In 2024, the company onboarded over 30 new partners and certified more than 60 new partner applications, further enhancing its ecosystem.

### Outlook

* Management initiated 2025 guidance, projecting operational EBITDA between $490 million and $500 million, supported by 5%-7% service revenue growth.
* Iridium anticipates that IoT will deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2025, driven by a step-up in fixed-price contracts with its largest IoT customer and the introduction of new products leveraging mid-band technology.
* CapEx for 2025 is projected at approximately $90 million, reflecting investment in 3GPP standards and testing for Iridium’s L band waveform.
* The company expects minimal cash taxes of less than $10 million annually through 2026.

### Financial Results

* Q4 service revenue reached $127.3 million, up 5% year-over-year, while total revenue grew 9% to $213 million. Government service revenue rose to $26.8 million, reflecting a step-up in the EMSS contract.
* IoT revenue increased by 15%, driven by strong growth in personal communications. However, IoT subscribers declined by 15,000, attributed to changes in a major customer’s pricing plans.
* Commercial broadband revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $13.4 million, influenced by ARPU adjustments as customers transitioned to companion services. Subscriber equipment sales increased 38% to $21.6 million, reflecting normalized demand after pandemic-related inventory disruptions.
* Engineering and support revenue grew 20% to $37.4 million, supported by expanded contracts with the U.S. Space Development Agency.

* Chris Quilty, Quilty Space: Questioned the maritime market and Starlink’s impact. Desch noted that Iridium remains the preferred companion service for maritime broadband, supported by its GMDSS-certified terminals.
* Walter Piecyk, LightShed Ventures: Asked about Aireon’s future. Desch indicated that Aireon is exploring recapitalization and has strong growth prospects in aviation analytics.
