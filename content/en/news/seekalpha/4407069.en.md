Earnings Call Insights: Camtek Ltd. (NASDAQ:[CAMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAMT "Camtek Ltd.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Camtek reported record Q4 2024 revenues of $117.3 million, a 32% year-over-year increase, and an operating income of $36.3 million, up 42% year-over-year, according to CEO Rafi Amit. Full-year 2024 revenue reached $429 million, a 36% year-over-year growth.
* High-performance computing (HPC) was a significant growth driver, accounting for 50% of total revenue in 2024 and expected to maintain at least this level in the first half of 2025. Recent orders worth over $10 million for HPC-related products were highlighted.
* The Eagle G5 and Hawk inspection systems were discussed as key contributors to the company’s competitive positioning. The Hawk is set to officially launch at the Semicon Korea Show, targeting advanced applications such as sub-10-micron defect detection with higher throughput. Amit emphasized, "The Hawk will increase our total available market by at least $200 million."
* CFO Moshe Eisenberg noted, "Fourth quarter revenues came in ahead of our guidance," and added that the company generated $16.2 million in cash from operations during the quarter.

### Outlook

* Revenue guidance for Q1 2025 is projected to be between $118 million and $120 million, representing nearly 25% year-over-year growth. Management expects demand for HPC-related products to remain robust throughout 2025 and beyond.
* CEO Rafi Amit highlighted a shift in HPC module manufacturing trends, with OSATs (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) playing a more significant role, which presents further opportunities for Camtek.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 gross margin was 50.6%, slightly above the 49.2% from Q4 2023. Operating profit increased to $36.3 million from $25.5 million in the same period last year.
* Net income for Q4 2024 was $37.7 million or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $28.2 million or $0.57 per share in Q4 2023.
* Cash and cash equivalents totaled $501.2 million as of December 31, 2024. Inventory levels rose to $123.1 million to support anticipated sales growth, while accounts receivable increased to $99.6 million due to timing of collections.

### Q&A

* Charles Shi, Needham & Company: Questioned the mix of HPC demand between HBM and Chiplet-related applications. COO Ramy Langer explained that demand remains strong and balanced across both segments, with significant orders on hand for HBM products.
* Kyle Bleustein, Barclays: Asked about the timing for hybrid bonding adoption. Langer noted that initial production is underway, but high-volume production is expected to begin around 2027-2028, with the Hawk system playing a major role in this segment.
* Matthew Prisco, Cantor Fitzgerald: Inquired about the market opportunities for the Eagle G5 and Hawk systems. Langer stated that the Hawk opens new markets in advanced packaging, potentially expanding the total available market by at least $200 million.
* Brian Chin, Stifel: Sought clarity on HBM 4 adoption and its implications for Camtek’s systems. Langer highlighted that the Eagle G5 meets most current HBM requirements, while the Hawk offers advantages for customers prioritizing higher throughput.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about the visibility into the second half of 2025 and potential bottlenecks in capacity expansion for HPC-related components. The overall tone was cautiously optimistic, with a focus on near-term growth.
* Management displayed confidence during prepared remarks, emphasizing strong demand and robust order pipelines. In the Q&A, responses were detailed and aligned with forward-looking optimism, though certain longer-term questions, particularly related to hybrid bonding and HBM 4 adoption, were met with cautious language.

* Analysts’ focus shifted slightly towards the Hawk system's potential to capture new market opportunities and the ongoing adoption of hybrid bonding technologies.
* Management confidence in HPC and advanced packaging trends remained strong, with an emphasis on expanding market share through new product introductions.

### Risks and Concerns

* Potential bottlenecks in HBM production capacity were highlighted as a challenge, particularly related to 2.5D substrate availability.
* Hybrid bonding adoption for high-volume production is still several years away, posing uncertainties for long-term growth.
* Analysts raised questions about potential overcapacity risks in the HPC market, though management emphasized balanced demand across key segments.

### Final Takeaway

Camtek ended 2024 with record financial results and solid growth driven by strong demand for HPC-related products.
