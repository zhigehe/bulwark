* PBF Energy [press release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001122-pbf-energy-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-declares-dividend-of-0_275-per) (NYSE:[PBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBF "PBF Energy Inc.")): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of -$2.82  misses by $0.04.
* Revenue of $7.35B (-19.6% Y/Y)  misses by $70M.
* At year-end, we had approximately $536 million of cash and approximately $921 million of net debt. We paid approximately $119 million in dividends in 2024 and continued to execute on our share repurchase program, finishing the year with over $1 billion in total program-to-date share repurchases, including approximately $330 million repurchased in 2024. We believe these measures have generated significant value for our investors in the near-term and, more importantly, demonstrate our commitment to fiscal discipline and long-term value creation.
