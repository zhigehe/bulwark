Qorvo (NASDAQ:[QRVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QRVO "Qorvo, Inc.")) reported its December quarter a couple of days before Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) adding understanding to both businesses. Within its own disclosures, management outlined both positive and negative effects from its decision to abandon lower-tier phones in particular from the China phone OEMs. Management announced a much deeper and longer period of time for transitioning the business. In review, Qorvo abandoned lower-tiered Android markets. At the last call, they spoke of only the effect for FY-2025 as if it ended in that time frame. With new information, we are in need of recalibrating future values on this rather long and winding road. This continues our coverage of the company, our last being, [*Qorvo Resets Its Markets*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739306-qorvo-stock-resets-its-markets). In that discussion, we outlined future results using the best available knowledge of management's targets. Well, in actuality, we must grab the keys, again, get in the car and navigate that road.

The Long & Winding Road Exposed
-------------------------------

During the call, [the prepared remarks contained](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752738-qorvo-inc-qrvo-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript) an investor exposure to a clearer vision:

> "Our 5G product development spend is now **focused solely on premium and flagship tiers**. While we continue to serve mass tier programs previously awarded, we expect these **lower-margin programs to go end of line in fiscal '26 and into fiscal '27**. To size the impact for fiscal '25, total **Android 5G** revenue in ACG is expected to be approximately $875 million. Of this, we expect Android 5G to decline gradually by approximately **$150 million to $200 million annually in fiscal '26 and again in fiscal '27**. The majority of the decline will be China-based with the balance being mid-tier at Samsung."

Further below in this article, we will try to resolve a major or is it a conflict with the term "and again in fiscal '27."

Continuing, management gave investors valuable, yet general guidance.

> "In fiscal '26, we expect a single digit decline in ACG revenue and growth of approximately 10% to 12% in CSG and HPA, ex the silicon carbide business."

At the End of the Long & Winding Road
-------------------------------------

After traveling the long and winding road, what can investors expect. Management stated:

* Unchanged business targets, meaning:
  + A goal of HPA/CSG revenue greater than ACG.
* FY-27: ACG growth of mid-single digits.
* HPA & CSG: Long-term growth of double digits.
  + Guided the next two years at long-term double-digit growth.

In part, Qorvo abandoned lower margin businesses, expanding the prospects for significantly higher margins.

A Segment Review
----------------

Before we continue, a review of the three segments seems once again in order. The segments include High Performance Analog (HPA), Sensors Group ("CSG") and Advanced Cellular Group ("ACG"). From last year's Investor Presentation, HPA/CSG markets were estimated with long-term growth rates in the high teens. ACG growth was in the middle single digits. HPA contains among other businesses Defense & Aerospace, which now marks in at $400 million. It also includes power management another growth market. June tends to be the weakest quarter. Management estimates growth afterward at 12%. Long-term, it is high teens.

CSG includes automotive solutions and SOCs for Ultra-Wideband, BLE, Thread, and Matter.

ACG contains the smartphone business, the one in super transition. It is important to note that much of Wi-Fi 7 isn't in this segment.

One business, infrastructure, including base stations, has bottomed and is expected to grow going forward.

We thought including a slide [from the Investor Day](https://ir.qorvo.com/static-files/accd0cea-582f-4646-97c6-5da6ef0559e2) might be helpful though it is a little dated.

[![Business Summary](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/10/7991031-17391967036069057.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/10/7991031-17391967036069057_origin.jpg)



Qorvo Investor Day





Again, the smartphone business is not the focal point for growth.

**The December quarter results in bullet format:**

* Revenue of $916 million.
* non-GAAP earnings of $1.61.
* non-GAAP margin of 46.5%,
* Cash of $770 million with long-term debt equaling $1.5 billion.
* Apple represented approximately 50% of the business.

**Guidance for the March quarter was:**

* Revenue of $850 million.
* non-GAAP margins of 43% - 44%.
* Earnings of $1.
* "As we look into fiscal '26, we expect gross margin to expand by approximately **150 basis** points on **roughly flat revenue**."

Tax rates going forward are in flux with a new administration in place.

FY-2026 & Beyond
----------------

Now, management left ambiguity for investors with respect to the amount of falling revenue in the future smartphone business. Continuing,

> "Beginning in FY27, we expect ACG to return to growth where our updated long-term revenue target is for mid-single-digit growth."

On its face, management expects ACG growth for the entire FY-27. But again, they also included this in the prepared remarks:

> "Of this, we expect Android 5G to decline gradually by approximately **$150 million to $200 million annually in fiscal '26 and again in fiscal '27**."

Then came the real confusion. Management states this: "In ACG, we expect Android 5G to decline by $150 million to $200 million from approximately $875 million in fiscal '25." Followed with a question from Gary Mobley of Loop,

> "I wanted to verify some of the numbers that you guys had in your prepared remarks. If I heard correctly, you would have in fiscal year '25 about $875 million of revenue from Android customers and that -- that might whittle down to something less than $500 million over the next five years."

Bob Bruggeworth, CEO, answered,

> "You're correct on the $875 million and you're correct on it's going to be going down about $150 million to $200 million this year, probably the same."

He seems to only confirm today's revenue shortfall and a range of $150 million to $200 million coming next fiscal year.

For the entire FY-26 year, Qorvo forecasts flat revenue year over year with gross margins up on average 150 basis points. They also expect revenue with Apple to be up slightly in FY-26 in spite of total phone revenue modestly lower. Management also stated that with Apple transitioning from Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")) modems to their own, it is highly likely that Qorvo will win the ETP mix at significant ASPs. Gross margins are expected to be in the high 40s during FY-26 in the strong quarters and above 50 in FY-27 for those quarters.

Reworking Future Revenue Envisioned
-----------------------------------

In our last article, we calculated a possible revenue with CSG/HPA becoming greater than AGC. [From that article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739306-qorvo-stock-resets-its-markets),

> "In terms of diversification, our long-term objective *is to generate 50%* or more of total revenue from HPA plus CSG. In the September quarter, HPA plus CSG represented approximately 28% of total revenue. This was up sequentially and up from 23% in the same quarter last year.

An updated estimate can be summarized in the next revised table.

| **Management Model** | **FY-25** | **FY-26** | **Target Percent** | **Growth** | **Approximate Revenue** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AGC \* | $2.61 billion \*\* | $2.5 billion \*\*\* | <50% | Mid-single (5%) | $8.6 billion \*\*\*\*\* |
| CSG & HPA | $1.12 billion | $1.23 billion | >50& | Mid-Double (13%) |  |

\* In the September quarter, AGC was slightly more than 70% of the total revenue. They expect that that value will fall $100 million in the current fiscal year and another approximately $200 million in the next. In addition, Apple revenue is expected to grow in the low single digits not including possible ETP revenue.

\*\* Calculation equals $3.73 billion (actual FY-25 plus March guidance) times 0.7, or $2.610 billion.

\*\*\* AGC calculation - minus $150 million for mid-tier plus low single digit Apple growth. Apple represents approximately 50% of the total revenue. $2.61 billion minus $0.175 billion plus $3.73 billion times 0.02 or $2.5 billion.

\*\*\*\* CSG/HPA equals $3.73 billion minus $2.50 billion.

\*\*\*\*\* Convergence for the segments equaled 10 years at $8.6 billion.

The updated estimate reduces from 3 times to 2.3 times FY-25 projected revenue in approximately 10 years. At 50%+ margins, gross profits are in the $4.5 billion range. Current cash expenses are currently in the $1 billion per year. Obviously, costs will increase. At $1.5 billion per year, cash before tax might equal $2 billion. Taxes at current rates of approximately 10% suggest profits equaling $1.8 billion. At [90 million shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qrvo/institutional-holdings) earnings are in the $20 range. This is considerably lower than our past calculation of $35. Still at $20 time a 15 P/E a stock price **of $350 - $400 or four to five times today's price in the 70s**.

Analyst's Upgrade
-----------------

Qorvo investors experienced a significant price increase with news of a game-changing event when ["activist Starboard"](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4396091-qorvo-jumps-after-activist-starboard-takes-stake) purchased a significant stake. Piper Sandler upgraded [Qorvo to Overweight](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398862-qorvo-gets-bullish-views-at-piper-sandler-after-activist-stake) "citing potential for improving fundamentals due to Starboard Value's involvement in the company." The analysts group noted,

> "Historically, the activist has had a remarkable track record in situations of this nature where opex efficiencies, capital footprint efficiencies, product pruning, and strategic divestitures might be required."

They suggested that up to $350 million in operational savings may be achieved with this restructuring group on board. (Our above earnings estimate will increase to $25+ if this proves true.) The Piper price target is $110, a long way higher than the $75 of today.

Risks
-----

One risk is always that tech companies with significant consumer exposure carry recession risks. Another risk exposed in the past few weeks is the risk with Apple. Skyworks ([SWKS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWKS "Skyworks Solutions, Inc.")) just notified investors that Apple decided to dual source a key RF component cutting Works' revenue on that product in half. It also appears from news rumors that Apple with its own path wants to eliminate as much of Qualcomm, if not all, as possible going forward. With Qualcomm gone, it seems that the giant will share RF business among the three left. It might be dicey at times.

When companies experience longer transition periods or long periods between lumpy growth drivers, stock prices can be volatile. Qorvo now experiences at least six quarters of transitioning. Investors likely have time to watch for buying opportunities. One caution in this approach is the entrance of Starlight. That could or might move the price needle forward with either rumors or actual cost-saving results. We view this as a very long-term dynamite play. We do own several thousand shares and continue to sell rich calls having generated rich cash rewards. We rate this a buy, but only on one's own definition of weakness. The price is truly undervalued, even Piper noticed this. Remember, the road is long and winding, but catalysis for rapid price changes also will move at times.
