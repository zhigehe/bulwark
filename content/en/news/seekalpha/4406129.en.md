Wall Street opened [lower](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405985-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market "lower") on Tuesday, with markets on edge after yet more tariff implementation by U.S. President Donald Trump. Here are some stocks to watch on Tuesday:

* Shares of Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")) added nearly 4% in morning trade, after the world's largest soft drinks maker [delivered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406001-coca-cola-rallies-after-smashing-organic-sales-expectations-lapping-pepsicos-mark "delivered") a significant beat on Q4 organic revenue driven primarily by higher prices for its sodas. Latin America continued to remain a major market for Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")), with organic revenue surging 25% from that region. Meanwhile, prices jumped 12% in the quarter in North America, amid robust consumer spending. For 2025, KO anticipates organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, and its adjusted profit per share outlook was above expectations. See how KO performed [in charts](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406044-coca-cola-in-charts-america-and-asia-pacific-drive-6-revenue-growth-in-q4 "in charts").
* Class A shares of Marriott International ([MAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAR "Marriott International, Inc.")) slipped almost 5%, after the world's largest hotel chain provided current quarter and full-year 2025 adjusted profit per share guidance that [missed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406049-marriott-internationals-soft-guidance-overshadows-top-and-bottom-line-beat "missed") estimates. Marriott ([MAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAR "Marriott International, Inc.")) sees earnings between $2.20 to $2.26 per share for Q1 2025, and $9.82 to $10.19 per share for the year. Both ranges were below the consensus figures. At a time when travel has been booming and consumers have been willing to spend on tourism, the outlook was likely seen as too conservative.
* U.S.-listed shares of Shopify ([SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")) fell nearly 2%, despite the Canadian e-commerce company [reporting](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406002-shopify-see-sales-operating-income-and-free-cash-flow-sail-higher-in-q4 "reporting") a more than 30% Y/Y jump in Q4 revenue. "Q4 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of 25% or greater revenue growth when excluding logistics," finance chief Jeff Hoffmeister said. "GMV growth accelerated each quarter this year, achieving a 24% year-over-year increase in 2024, marking our highest GMV growth in three years," he added. At the end of 2024, Shopify's ([SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")) U.S. e-commerce market share stood at 12%. See how SHOP performed [in charts](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406062-shopify-in-charts-segment-and-performance-indicators-hit-all-time-high-in-q4 "in charts").
* Humana ([HUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUM "Humana Inc.")) stock slipped about 1%, after the managed care player said it expects to see a [decline](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406009-humana-stock-focus-q4-results "decline") of about 550K, or 10%, in 2025 in Medicare Advantage (MA) annual membership from 2024. Humana ([HUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUM "Humana Inc.")) is the second-largest MA insurer after UnitedHealth ([UNH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated")), and has faced multiple headwinds in that market segment, including a decline in its Medicare Star Ratings and worsening medical expenses. "The path to achieving compelling margins in individual MA is a multi-year process," company management said in prepared remarks.
