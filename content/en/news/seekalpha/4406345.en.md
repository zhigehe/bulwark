LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ([OTCPK:LVMHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMHF "LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne")) could see a lift in its multiple due to accelerating organic growth in the fashion and leather goods industry, according to Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley’s Europe Luxury analysts see the fashion and leader goods industry’s organic sales growth at or above 5% this year, benefiting luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton ([OTCPK:LVMHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMHF "LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne")).

“Although [Morgan Stanley’s analysts] saw a 1% contraction in 2024, our analysts believe it is off to an encouraging start year-to-date, and the comparison base gets easier in the latter part of the year,” said Katy L. Huberty, global head of Research at Morgan Stanley, in a note.

If the industry keeps its more than 5.1% two-year stack growth rate constant for the remainder of the year, the organic sales growth would see a rise of 6% for the full year 2025.

Huberty also said that there has been, historically, a high correlation between Louis Vuitton’s ([OTCPK:LVMHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMHF "LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne")) forward P/E and the fashion and leather goods industry’s organic sales growth.

Morgan analysts are overweight the Louis Vuitton ([OTCPK:LVMHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMHF "LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne")) stock. Its index is up 8% year-to-date.
