Earnings Call Insights: Adaptive Biotechnologies (NASDAQ:[ADPT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADPT "Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Chad Robins highlighted a strong year for Adaptive Biotechnologies, with MRD revenue increasing by 42% year-over-year. Key drivers included a higher gapfill rate of $2,007 for the clonoSEQ test and an ODAC vote supporting MRD as a primary endpoint for multiple myeloma therapies.
* The company delivered a record 20,945 clonoSEQ tests in Q4, a 34% year-over-year increase. Key growth areas included blood-based MRD testing, which grew 55%, and community testing, which increased 38%.
* Adaptive announced a strategic partnership with NeoGenomics to cross-promote clonoSEQ and Neo’s COMPASS and CHART services, aiming to expand its community presence.
* CFO Kyle Piskel reported Q4 revenue of $47.5 million, with MRD contributing 85%. ClonoSEQ tests achieved an average ASP of $11.17 per test in the U.S., a 7% increase from 2023.

### Outlook

* Management guided 2025 MRD revenue to $175 million to $185 million, expecting a 40-60 revenue split between the first and second half of the year. Key drivers include higher ASPs, expanded payer coverage, and increased blood-based testing.
* An average ASP of $1,300 per test is targeted for FY 2025, supported by re-contracting with payers, expanded Medicaid coverage, and improved collections.
* The company plans to achieve adjusted EBITDA positivity for MRD in the second half of 2025 through cost efficiencies and operational improvements, including the transition to NovaSeq X sequencing.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue was $47.5 million compared to analysts’ estimate of $46.05 million. Adjusted EPS was not explicitly stated in the transcript for comparison.
* MRD revenue grew 31% year-over-year, with clinical and pharma contributions of 65% and 35%, respectively. Immune Medicine revenue declined 51%, driven by lower Genentech amortization and reduced pharma services.
* Sequencing gross margin rose to 59%, up 11 percentage points year-over-year, driven by lab efficiencies and lower costs per sample.
* Net loss for Q4 was $33.7 million, and cash reserves stood at $256 million, reflecting a 40% year-over-year reduction in cash burn.

### Q&A

* Andrew Brackmann, William Blair, asked about the $1,300 ASP target. CFO Kyle Piskel attributed it to the full-year impact of the gapfill rate, re-contracting with payers, Medicaid traction, and improved revenue cycle management.
* Rachel Vatnsdal, JPMorgan, inquired about the pacing of NeoGenomics contributions. Chief Commercial Officer Susan Bobulsky indicated pilot programs will begin in H2 2025, with material contributions expected in 2026 and 2027.
* Tejas Savant, Morgan Stanley, asked about the NovaSeq X transition's impact on margins. Harlan Robins explained it would result in a 5-8 percentage point gross margin improvement over 12 months, with significant cost efficiencies.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on pricing improvements, partnerships, and operational efficiencies. Concerns were raised about Immune Medicine revenue declines and payer dynamics.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strategic initiatives and cost controls. CEO Chad Robins consistently reinforced the company’s ability to achieve profitability in MRD by H2 2025.
* Compared to Q3, the tone was similar, with continued focus on execution and growth in the MRD business.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* MRD test volume grew sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Clinical revenue increased, supported by higher ASPs and expanded payer coverage.
* Management reiterated the $1,300 ASP target for 2025, first mentioned in Q3. The NeoGenomics partnership represents a new growth lever not discussed in detail during the previous quarter.
* Analysts maintained similar concerns regarding payer adoption and Immune Medicine performance, though they acknowledged progress in operational efficiencies.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted challenges in payer adoption, particularly with uncontracted payers and Medicaid. Efforts to secure higher reimbursement rates are ongoing.
* Analysts questioned the sustainability of Immune Medicine revenue, particularly given reduced contributions from the Genentech partnership.
* The success of the NovaSeq X transition, expected in H2 2025, remains a key operational dependency for margin improvements.

### Final Takeaway

Adaptive Biotechnologies reported robust growth in its MRD business, driven by higher ASPs, increased test volumes, and expanded payer coverage. The company remains focused on achieving profitability in MRD by H2 2025 through operational efficiencies and strategic partnerships. While challenges persist in Immune Medicine revenue and payer dynamics, management expressed confidence in its ability to maintain growth and execute on its 2025 priorities.
