The artificial intelligence revolution seems to have firmly encompassed software, as evidenced by recent results and announcements from Palantir (NASDAQ:[PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")) and Salesforce (NYSE:[CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM "Salesforce, Inc.")), Wedbush Securities said.

"Now the time has come for the broader software space to get in on the AI Party as we believe the use cases are exploding, enterprise consumption phase is ahead of us in 2025, launch of LLM models across the board, and the true adoption of generative AI will be a major catalyst for the software sector and key players to benefit from this once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution set to benefit the tech space," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. "The AI Software era is now here in our view. We believe the two best software plays on the AI Revolution for 2025 remain Palantir and Salesforce."

Ives also mentioned Oracle ([ORCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL "Oracle Corporation")), IBM ([IBM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM "International Business Machines Corporation")), Innodata, Snowflake ([SNOW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNOW "Snowflake Inc.")), MongoDB ([MBD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBD "M3-Brigade Acquisition IV Corp.")), Elastic ([ESTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESTC "Elastic N.V.")) and Pegasystems ([PEGA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEGA "Pegasystems Inc.")) as other software beneficiaries.

And with Palantir's jump in valuation after its most [recent](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402568-palantir-surges-over-20-after-q4-beat-outlook-keep-analysts-largely-bullish "recent") results and guidance, Wall Street is still underestimating the impact of AI on software, Ives added.

"We believe Palantir is on the front lines of enterprise AI use cases and the multiplier impact for the rest of tech is the start of a generational $2 trillion of Cap-Ex over the next 3 years for the AI world," he wrote.

"As more enterprises head down the path of building out AI use cases along with governments, we believe the Street is still underestimating the impact of AI spending for the broader tech world. We believe tech earnings season answered a lot of questions and put DeepSeek agita to rest (for now) although there will continue to be other worries that could come out of left field in this AI buildout."
