S&P 500 real estate stocks ended in green for a week that saw major market averages suffer the impact of a surge in consumers' inflation expectations and trade war concerns.

The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:[XLRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLRE "The Real Estate Select Sector SPDRÂ® Fund ETF")) added 1.33% for the week to close at 41.97, logging gains in two, losses in two, and a flat result in one of the five trading sessions.

The fund retreated 0.17% on Monday after President Donald Trump [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402227-nasdaq-sp-and-dow-closed-lower-to-start-the-week-as-tariff-talks-heat-up "announced") new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, a move that analysts warn could trigger a trade war. Later on, delays were announced against tariffs towards Mexico until March.

XLRE closed **flat** the next day after a [tariff delay for Canada](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402333-us-will-delay-canada-tariffs-as-countries-work-on-beefing-up-border-security "tariff delay for Canada") by at least 30 days was announced, while the [10% tariff on China](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402743-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market "10% tariff on China") was retained.

The ETF closed the next two trading sessions in green as earnings took the centerstage, but swung to 0.36% of losses on Friday as Trump [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405350-trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-are-coming-so-what-are-they "announced") plans for "reciprocal tariffs" the coming week.

S&P 500 real estate stocks with significant international exposure like Weyerhaeuser ([WY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WY "Weyerhaeuser Company")) and Prologis ([PLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLD "Prologis, Inc.")) were among the top losers of the week.

**Earnings**

Healthpeak Properties ([DOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOC "Healthpeak Properties, Inc.")) was the top S&P 500 real estate loser even as the life sciences REIT [delivered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402256-healthpeak-properties-posts-q4-ffo-beat-in-line-2025-guidance "delivered") Q4 top and bottom lines that beat Wall Street expectations as leasing activity held up during the three-month period. DOC sees 2025 FFO per share, as adjusted, in line with the average analyst estimate.

Management [acknowledged](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402974-healthpeak-properties-outlines-500m-investments-for-2025-with-focus-on-lab-and-outpatient "acknowledged") challenges in the life sciences sector, including oversupply and tenant credit risks. Another notable life sciences REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities ([ARE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARE "Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.")) also found a place among the worst weekly performers.

The U.S. [life sciences real estate sector](https://www.cbre.com/press-releases/demand-for-us-life-sciences-real-estate-grew-in-q4 "life sciences real estate sector") saw its vacancy rate rise to 19.7% in Q4 amid robust construction completions. Last year, the sector had benefitted from record-high life sciences employment in the country, a number of new drugs receiving federal approval and a 19% year-over-year increase in venture capital funding.

Meanwhile, Simon Property Group ([SPG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPG "Simon Property Group, Inc.")) was gaining even as the shopping mall REIT [posted](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403075-simon-property-q4-earnings-miss-delivers-in-line-2025-guidance "posted") mixed results for Q4. Piper Sandler [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403596-simon-property-upgraded-to-overweight-at-piper-after-mixed-q4-results "upgraded") the stock, citing that the 2025 outlook highlights the underlying earnings power of its real estate portfolio.

Multi-family residential REIT AvalonBay Communities ([AVB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVB "AvalonBay Communities, Inc.")) was among the losers, having [delivered](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404024-avalonbay-q4-bottom-line-falls-short-issues-in-line-guidance "delivered") Q4 earnings that rose less than expected in addition to in-line guidance for its bottom line. Meanwhile, Camden Property Trust ([CPT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPT "Camden Property Trust")) recorded the most gains for the week after its Q4 earnings and revenue [beat](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404789-camden-property-trust-q4-earnings-beat-2025-guidance-midpoint-lags-consensus "beat") consensus, even as rents decreased during the quarter, and dividend [rose](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404849-camden-property-trust-raises-dividend-by-2 "rose") by ~2%.

Other major earnings announcements came from Essex Property Trust ([ESS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESS "Essex Property Trust, Inc.")), Kimco Realty ([KIM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KIM "Kimco Realty Corporation")), Mid-America Apartment Communities ([MAA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAA "Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.")), Equity Residential ([EQR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQR "Equity Residential")), Regency Centers ([REG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REG "Regency Centers Corporation")), and UDR ([UDR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UDR "UDR, Inc.")).

**Performance**

The Dow Jones REIT Indx Equity REIT Total Return Index ([REIT:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REIT:IND "Dow Jones REIT Indx Equity REIT Total Return Index")) closed the week 1.17% higher at 2,652.04.

FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs (FNER) was up 1.24% as the benchmark United States 10-Year Bond Yield fell by 4 basis points to 4.50%. Meanwhile, FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs (FNMR) rose 1.92% on a weekly basis as mortgage rates [remained stable](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404546-mortgage-rates-drop-leading-to-increased-purchase-applications "remained stable") over the course of the month.

Comparatively, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.24% to end the week at 6,025.99.

The S&P 500 Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (SP500-6010) index added 1.39%, but the S&P 500 Real Estate Management & Development index saw a surprise fall of 0.43%.

The U.S. housing market was already struggling on the back of high mortgage rates, low supply of existing homes for sale, and historically high home prices, and the new tariffs are adding even more pressure, a recent report by CNBC News [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/trump-tariffs-news-construction-and-home-costs-could-rise.html "said").

Increasing tariffs on imported goods and curbing immigration are likely to bring up the cost of building new homes in the U.S., *Newsweek* [reported](https://www.newsweek.com/homebuyers-face-difficult-housing-market-under-trump-presidency-1982705 "reported"), citing experts.

Here is a look at the subsector performances for the week:
