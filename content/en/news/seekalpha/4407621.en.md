* Kelly Services [press release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001285-kelly-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-earnings) (NASDAQ:[KELYA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KELYA "Kelly Services, Inc.")): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.82  beats by $0.35.
* Revenue of $1.2B (-3.3% Y/Y)  beats by $50M.
* Revenue of $1.2 billion, a 3.3% decrease compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 resulting primarily from the sale of the Company’s European staffing operations on January 2, 2024, partially offset by the May 2024 acquisition of Motions Recruitment Partners (“MRP”). Excluding the European staffing operations and MRP, revenue was up 4.4% on an organic basis as organic growth initiatives drove market share gains despite broader industry declines. MRP revenue added 9.8% to reported fourth-quarter year-over-year revenue growth.
* Financial Outlook\*:
  
  First Half 2025:
  
  + *Revenue* – total Company first half revenue up approximately 10% due to the benefit of the MRP acquisition, up modestly on an organic basis
    - Total Company revenue growth will be slightly higher in Q1 than in Q2 given the May 31, 2024 MRP transaction closing date
  + *GP rate* – total Company rate up approximately 80 basis points reflecting the benefit of the MRP acquisition; organic GP rate roughly flat
  + *Adjusted SG&A* – increase modestly on a quarterly run rate basis relative to Q4 2024, includes impact of payroll tax and performance-based incentive resets
    - Total D&A of approximately $13.5 million per quarter expected
  + *Adjusted EBITDA margin* – up 10 basis points to approximately 3.6%
  + *Tax rate* – effective rate in the high teens
