Maskot





After generating 40% in price return last year, the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:[IGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGM "iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF")) is poised to extend momentum throughout 2025 amid a blistering tech sector growth outlook. The macroeconomic improvement, monetary outlook and the broader stock market trend also backs the bull run.

Tech Sector 2025 Outlook Signals Blistering Growth
--------------------------------------------------

![Earnings outlook 2025](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_8623709b751af7f0938a78601aa09d7f.png)



Earnings outlook 2025 (FactSet)





As revenue and earnings growth has generally been deemed as one of the key drivers of the share price upside and investor sentiment, the tech sector's robust financial growth outlook signals that the share price uptrend is expected to last throughout 2025. Indeed, my optimism is attributed to the sector's potential to accelerate its growth rate in 2025 compared to the past year.

According to the FactSet [data](https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_020725A.pdf "https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_020725A.pdf"), the sector's revenue and earnings growth rate is likely to enlarge by 12% and 21% year over year in 2025, respectively. The sector reported 10% revenue and 18% earnings growth in 2024 as large-caps reported record-breaking earnings with a high double-digit growth compared to the past year. The mega-caps are expected to sustain their growth rates in 2025 on the back of their gigantic investment potential and exposure to the AI market.

For example, Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and Meta ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) plans to spend [$75 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/alphabet-expects-to-invest-about-75-billion-in-capex-in-2025.html "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/alphabet-expects-to-invest-about-75-billion-in-capex-in-2025.html") and [$68 billion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-invest-up-65-bln-capital-expenditure-this-year-2025-01-24/ "https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-invest-up-65-bln-capital-expenditure-this-year-2025-01-24/") in 2025 in its core businesses and opportunities in the AI market. Similarly, Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) and Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) are sitting on hefty cash [reserves](https://www.ainvest.com/news/high-growth-tech-stocks-apple-microsoft-and-beyond-25011010aa1e20ac1b1c128f/ "https://www.ainvest.com/news/high-growth-tech-stocks-apple-microsoft-and-beyond-25011010aa1e20ac1b1c128f/") to invest in growth opportunities. Furthermore, the tech sector's revenue and earnings growth is expected to broaden. In the recent years, the magnificent-7 contributed significantly to the earnings growth. However, with rate cuts and economic recovery, mid and small caps are expected to bounce back.

On the other hand, the broader macroeconomic trend appears favourable for business activities, given 2.8% US GDP growth [forecast](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/12/economic-outlook-global-growth-to-remain-resilient-in-2025-and-2026-despite-significant-risks.html "https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/12/economic-outlook-global-growth-to-remain-resilient-in-2025-and-2026-despite-significant-risks.html") for 2025. Whereas, the Fed is [expected](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html "https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html") to slash rates steadily to end the year around 3.50% to 3.75% from the current range of 4.25%-4.5%. A steady economic growth, low rates and increased digitalization is also expected to increase activities in the venture and IPO market.

Tech sector forward PE (Yardeni)





On the valuation side, the information technology sector's forward valuation plunged from the recent peak. The sector is currently trading around 28x forward earnings compared to the recent high of 32x in 2024. A significant decline in forward price to earnings ratio is attributed to the robust earnings growth outlook. Whereas, tech stocks from the communication sector, such as Meta and Alphabet, are at lower valuation compared to other mega-caps. Meta and Alphabet are currently trading around 27x and 20x forward earnings, respectively.

IGM's Broader Tech Exposure Makes it a Solid Investment Option
--------------------------------------------------------------

As growth trend is expected to broaden across the tech sector, it appears to be a great strategy to use exchange traded funds with exposure to mega, large, mid and small caps. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF is one of the most prominent investment vehicles in the tech sector with a diversified portfolio structure. Its portfolio is composed of nearly 300 tech stocks, including mega, large, mid and small caps. Its top stock holdings make up 54% of the overall portfolio.

IGM top 10 holdings (Seeking Alpha)





Furthermore, ETF's exposure is not limited to the information technology sector. IGM's 22% of portfolio is composed of tech stocks from the communication sector. I believe exposure to tech stocks from the communication sector is critical because a large number of these stocks are soaring at a solid pace due to their robust growth rates. Meta, Alphabet and Netflix ([NFLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX "Netflix, Inc.")) are the key names in IGM's portfolio from the communication sector.

Alphabet, Meta and Netflix price returns (Seeking Alpha)





Shares of Meta, Alphabet and Netflix rallied 53%, 25% and 79% in the past twelve months. These companies continued to impress investors through their strong revenue and earnings growth rates. Meta and Alphabet's exposure to AI market adds to their share price rally. Meanwhile, Netflix has been going through one of the best times in its history given its extraordinary subscribers growth. In the December quarter, the largest streaming giant added a record 18.91 million net [subscribers](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397360-netflix-stock-hits-record-high-after-blowout-subscriber-net-adds-in-q4-analysts-cheer "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397360-netflix-stock-hits-record-high-after-blowout-subscriber-net-adds-in-q4-analysts-cheer"), up 44% year-over-year and reflect more than 100% increase compared to an expected increase of 9.18 million.

Its stake in the technology stocks, such as NVIDIA ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), Broadcom ([AVGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO "Broadcom Inc.")) and Microsoft, also increases its exposure to AI. NVIDIA continues to generate solid revenue and earnings growth, while Broadcom also seeks to capitalize on increased AI-powered chip demand. In the latest [quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19946241-broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results-and-quarterly#hasComeFromMpArticle=false "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19946241-broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results-and-quarterly#hasComeFromMpArticle=false"), Broadcom generated 51% year-over-year earnings growth, with expectations for nearly 22% growth in the March quarter of 2025. Besides the top 10 holdings, IGM's portfolio includes a long list of large, mid and small caps. While exposure to a large number of stocks increases its potential to capitalize on the broader tech market, the diversification factor also lowers the risk factor. A low-risk factor is also reflected in Seeking Alpha quant rating.

[![IGM quant rating](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_9839d06d6df5ce5587b16e3401d4ebb1_thumb1.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_9839d06d6df5ce5587b16e3401d4ebb1.png)



IGM quant rating (Seeking Alpha)





The ETF [earned](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGM/ratings/quant-ratings "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGM/ratings/quant-ratings") a B-plus grade on the risk factor. In addition to the diversification, a low short interest and standard deviation demonstrates that IGM carry a low risk factor. The ETF also earned an A-plus grade on a momentum factor, thanks to its strong share price upside in the last twelve months. Its portfolio combination of mega, large, mid and small-caps contributed to its share price upside. IGM's expense ratio of 0.40% is lower than the median of all ETFs of 0.49%. With $6 billion in assets under management and 251K in average daily share trading volume, the liquidity factor also appears strong enough for short and long-term investment.

Where Do the Peers Stand?
-------------------------

![IGM and peers quant rating](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/saupload_2aadb35792361121716f830ebc08683e.png)



IGM and peers quant rating (Seeking Alpha)





There are numerous investment options in the technology space. IGM's peers include First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund ETF ([FXL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXL "First Trust Tech AlphaDEX ETF")), Invesco Next Gen Connectivity ETF ([KNCT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KNCT "Invesco Dynamic Networking ETF")) and Invesco Dorsey Wright Technology Momentum ETF ([PTF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTF "Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust - Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF")). IGM received the highest quant score of 4.33 in its peers group. Although PTF's shares appreciated higher than IGM, the fund offers a limited exposure to the technology sector, with only 45 stock holdings. In addition, PTF's expense ratio is higher compared to IGM, while dividends and liquidity are lower.

Risk Factors to Consider
------------------------

While the tech sector offers lofty returns, its high beta also increases the downside risk. Therefore, ETF's price can decline faster than the S&P 500 index during the downturns. In addition, the ETF's performance also depends on broader macroeconomic and monetary conditions. The sluggish economic growth and tight monetary policies can negatively influence its performance. Although the sector's valuation declined from the recent peak, valuations are still higher than its long-term average.

In Conclusion
-------------

Investing in the technology sector appears to be a great strategy because of its blistering revenue and earnings growth power. Bullish broader market trends are also likely to fuel investor confidence in high beta stocks and ETFs. Moreover, using investing vehicles like iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF could help investor capitalize on the broader tech sector while lowering a risk factor linked to single-stock or concentrated portfolios. Its expense ratio, share price momentum and liquidity also makes it a solid play for 2025 and long term.
