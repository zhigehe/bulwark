### Management View

* CEO Sander Noordende highlighted that trading conditions remained challenging in Q4 due to subdued hiring activities, particularly in North America, France, the Netherlands, and Germany. However, sequential stabilization was observed across markets, supported by improvements in Spain, Italy, and Belgium.
* Revenues for the quarter totaled €6.1 billion, reflecting a 7.5% year-over-year decline. Gross margin was 19.8%, down 40 basis points, attributed to service and geographic mix. Underlying EBITA stood at €181 million, equating to 3% of revenue.
* The company completed the rollout of its specialization framework across all markets, creating dedicated teams for operational, professional, digital, and enterprise segments. This initiative aims to enhance delivery excellence and support growth.
* Randstad also announced the merger of Monster with CareerBuilder, forming the third-largest job board in the U.S., which is expected to deliver significant scale benefits.
* CFO Jorge Vazquez emphasized operational discipline, noting sequential revenue stabilization and a slight uptick in revenue compared to Q3. He stated, "We are putting ourselves in the best position for recovery."

### Outlook

* Management expects challenging macroeconomic conditions to persist in Q3 2024 while focusing on reducing indirect costs and maintaining field capacity to support strategic investments.
* Stable volumes were observed in early July, with gross margin expected to remain broadly in line sequentially.
* The roll-out of digital marketplaces, including the U.S. platform with an annual run rate exceeding €1 billion, is expected to drive growth through better client ramp-ups, talent retention, and productivity.
