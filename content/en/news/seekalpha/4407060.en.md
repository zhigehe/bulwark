Earnings Call Insights: Slate Grocery REIT ([OTC:SRRTF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRRTF "Slate Grocery REIT")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Blair Welch highlighted strong Q4 and year-end performance, driven by robust leasing activity at double-digit rental spreads. Same-property NOI increased by $6.7 million or 4.3% on a 12-month trailing basis. Nearly 3 million square feet of leasing was completed in 2024, with new deals securing rents 28% above prior averages and non-option renewals 14% higher than expiring rents.
* Welch emphasized the REIT’s ability to finance $630 million of debt at comparable spreads to maturing debt, showcasing lender confidence in the portfolio. Despite operational strength, the REIT’s units remain undervalued compared to NAV, which Welch described as a "compelling investment opportunity."
* CFO Joe Pleckaitis noted a one-time refinancing charge of $150,000 in Q4 due to mortgage-related expenses, which will not recur in future quarters.

### Outlook

* Management expects the continuation of double-digit leasing spreads into 2025, supported by limited retail construction and strong tenant demand. Allen Gordon noted that the REIT has achieved seven consecutive quarters of double-digit renewal spreads.
* Welch explained that timing for NOI realization from leasing activity varies between 30 days and 12 months, depending on tenant type. The REIT expects NOI growth to remain aligned with leasing spread performance.
* Connor O’Brien discussed the transaction pipeline, highlighting CBRE’s projection of $10 billion in open-air retail transactions for 2025. The REIT plans to pursue acquisitions of grocery-anchored properties with under-market rents and positive leverage potential.

### Financial Results

* Same-property NOI grew $6.7 million or 4.3% over the past year, with portfolio occupancy stable at 94.8%. Average in-place rents rose to $12.65 per square foot, significantly below the market average of $23.80, offering room for further rent growth.
* The REIT successfully refinanced $630 million in debt, maintaining financial stability despite challenging market conditions. Refinancing costs led to a one-time charge of $150,000, which will not impact future quarters.
* Leasing activity for the year totaled nearly 3 million square feet, with rental spreads of 28% above prior rents for new deals and 14% above for renewals.

### Q&A

* Sairam Srinivas, Cormark Securities, asked about the outlook for leasing spreads and their impact on NOI. Welch confirmed expectations for continued double-digit spreads, while Allen Gordon emphasized the REIT’s consistent spread performance over seven quarters.
* Srinivas inquired about transaction activity and private equity interest in U.S. retail assets. Welch highlighted significant private investor demand for assets generating U.S. dollar revenues and reiterated the REIT’s focus on disciplined acquisitions.
* Brad Sturges, Raymond James, asked about the potential for occupancy gains beyond 94.8%. Welch noted that occupancy may fluctuate within a range of 94% to 96%, with NOI growth largely driven by rental spread increases rather than occupancy gains.
* Pammi Bir, RBC Capital Markets, explored asset recycling strategies. Welch confirmed plans to dispose of non-strategic assets, with Connor O’Brien adding that several non-grocery properties are earmarked for sale in 2025.
* Sumayya Syed, CIBC, asked about higher bad debt levels due to tenant bankruptcies. Connor O’Brien explained that these situations often present opportunities to mark rents to market, noting successful re-leasing efforts for locations impacted by Big Lots and Party City bankruptcies.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed interest in leasing spreads, transaction activity, and bad debt impacts, with overall sentiment remaining neutral to slightly positive. Questions were focused on understanding growth drivers and potential challenges.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strong leasing performance and the REIT’s ability to capitalize on market conditions. Welch frequently highlighted the REIT’s undervalued position and strategic opportunities.
* Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management displayed consistent sentiment, with continued focus on leasing and operational stability.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Leasing activity expanded significantly, with total square footage increasing from 850,000 in Q3 to nearly 3 million for the year. Rental spreads also improved from 24.8% above prior rents in Q3 to 28% in Q4.
* Debt refinancing increased from $500 million in Q3 to $630 million in Q4, further strengthening the REIT’s financial position.
* While Q3 emphasized addressing debt maturities and NOI growth, Q4 focused on leasing performance and preparing for acquisition opportunities in 2025.

### Risks and Concerns

* Tenant bankruptcies remain a short-term challenge but are seen as opportunities for rent increases. Current bad debt levels are manageable at 0.5% of revenue.
* Rising interest rates and refinancing pressures are ongoing risks, though the REIT has mitigated these through proactive refinancing efforts.
* Limited new retail construction supports pricing power but underscores reliance on existing assets for growth.

### Final Takeaway

Slate Grocery REIT delivered robust Q4 results, driven by strong leasing performance and stable financial management. The REIT remains focused on capturing NOI growth through rental spreads, disciplined acquisitions, and asset recycling. While challenges such as tenant bankruptcies and refinancing costs persist, the REIT is well-positioned for sustained growth in 2025, supported by favorable market dynamics and investor interest in grocery-anchored real estate.
