Richard Drury





After the bell on Wednesday, one of the market's biggest losers was Reddit (NYSE:[RDDT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT "Reddit, Inc.")). The online community company saw its shares drop roughly 15% after the company reported [its fourth quarter results](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20000629-reddit-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20000629-reddit-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false"). While the headline numbers were great and current quarter guidance was solid, this was a stock that had soared from the low $50s to over $215 a share in just six months. Perhaps this was a "buy the rumor, sell the news" type of event again, so long-term investors might have an opportunity here.

**Previous coverage of the name**
---------------------------------

I last looked at the name in early December, at which point I had turned my opinion [around on the name](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741945-reddit-looking-for-more-massive-growth-rating-upgrade "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741945-reddit-looking-for-more-massive-growth-rating-upgrade"). The growth story was looking much stronger, and the company had turned its bottom line around, reporting a GAAP profit in Q3 2024. With a strong balance sheet, the name looked like it had a decent setup moving forward, even if the valuation seemed a bit extreme.

At the time of that article, Reddit shares were around $150, and don't forget that this was an IPO at just $34 early last year. Even after that massive rally, the stock continued its climb into early 2025, topping out just over $230 a share recently. However, the post-earnings reaction sent the stock down double digits, percentage wise, in the after-hours session, leaving shares back in the high $180s.

**The Q4 report**
-----------------

For the final quarter of 2024, Reddit reported revenues of nearly $428 million. This number was more than $22 million ahead of the street's average estimate. While that was the smallest top-line beat in any quarter of 2024, the street was well ahead of Reddit's guidance range for $385 million to $400 million, and the company still did beat by a decent margin. As detailed in [the company's shareholder letter](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001713445/000171344525000016/rddt-20250212.htm "https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001713445/000171344525000016/rddt-20250212.htm"), the overall financial picture here is improving quite nicely.

Reddit Q4 Financials (Company Shareholder Letter)





Reddit improved its gross margin by 420 basis points over the prior year period, coming in at 92.6% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating income came in at nearly $53 million, compared to just $3 million a year ago, with the company reporting its second straight quarterly GAAP profit. A couple of more profitable periods would likely make the name eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, which could be another significant positive catalyst, potentially for 2026.

While I like most about Reddit currently is its improved monetization structure. Not only did its daily active unique user count rise by about 40% year over year, but average revenues per user jumped 23%. That led to the overall revenue increase of 71%, and while expenses are also rising steadily, net income nearly quadrupled. The company earned 36 cents a share in the period, smashing street estimates by 11 cents.

For the current quarter, Reddit expects revenue between $360 million and $370 million. The bottom end of that range was above the street's average estimate for less than $359 million, and we saw how management's forecast for Q4 was very conservative. Adjusted EBITDA was projected to be in a range of $80 million to $90 million, which was quite a bit above the average analyst estimate for $72.3 million.

**Improved cash flow, but ongoing dilution**
--------------------------------------------

The significant bottom-line improvement has also dramatically changed the cash flow picture here. The company reported free cash flow of almost $90 million for Q4, a major turnaround from the $22 million plus cash burned in Q4 2023. The company finished 2024 with $1.84 billion in cash and investments, while total liabilities are only around $200 million.

Like many newer tech companies, Reddit does see large stock-based compensation expenses. That is increasing the share count a bit over time, although management noted that its fully diluted count did decline sequentially in Q4. With the company producing positive free cash flow, it may be able to start a share repurchase plan at some point this year, which may not be able to get the share count down a ton, but it least will help offset some of the further increases in shares due to employee and executive compensation.

**You are paying for growth here**
----------------------------------

I mentioned in my previous article that Reddit was a very expensive stock. At that time, shares were going for more than 15 times expected 2025 revenues, which was almost double the valuation of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")). Reddit does offer a lot more revenue growth potential in percentage terms in the near term, however, and up until Wednesday's after-hours session, investors seemed very willing to pay up for the name well into the mid-20s on a price to expected sales basis.

At a pullback price of $188, shares were going for about 19 times expected 2025 revenues. However, that was based on the estimate of $1.77 billion going into Wednesday's report. Given the beat and decent guidance, we should see estimates move higher, and remember that just 7 months ago, the street [was only looking](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT/earnings/revisions "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT/earnings/revisions") for $1.33 billion in revenues this year. If it turns out that Reddit does around $2 billion this year, that valuation won't be nearly as high based on the current price. I should also note that Meta's valuation on a 2025 price to expected sales basis has also risen about 5% since my previous article back in December.

I should also note that the pullback on Wednesday afternoon put shares just a dollar or two below the [average street price target](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT/ratings/sell-side-ratings "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT/ratings/sell-side-ratings") going into this report. For quite a while, Reddit shares were trading well above the street's average valuation, which had gone from just $122 a share in my previous article to over $188 this week. It would not surprise me if we see the street average top $200 at some point this year, should the revenue growth story and bottom-line improvement continue.

**Final thoughts and recommendation**
-------------------------------------

Reddit had a solid earnings report on Wednesday afternoon, but shares fell after the company's report. Revenues were well ahead of street estimates for the quarter, and the bottom line and cash flow situation improved nicely. Current quarter guidance was ahead of expectations, which will lead to further increases in street revenue estimates. The stock did drop on the news, but it had gone from $34 to well over $200 in less than a year, so perhaps a pullback was inevitable.

Given the continued progress and strong growth here, I'm going to increase my rating today to a buy. I know the valuation looks scary, but you are getting a ton of growth here with positive net income and cash flow. It wouldn't surprise me to see the stock make the S&P 500 sometime in the next year or so, which could be another positive catalyst to think about. Should the company continue to impress over the next few quarters, I think this post-earnings pullback could easily be forgotten.
