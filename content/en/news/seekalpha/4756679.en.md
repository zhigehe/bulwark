After a brief market hiccup in mid-summer, the bull market in global equities continued its advance in the third quarter, buoyed by improving inflation data and growing conviction around the potential for a soft global economic landing. Returns were led in part by a rotation away from big tech stocks in the US to the more value-oriented, economically sensitive areas of the market. Smaller capitalization equities gained ground on their larger cap counterparts, and emerging markets also outperformed, led in part by strong returns in China following their adoption near the quarter's end of a well-received fiscal and monetary stimulus package.

In this rather dynamic market environment, the Tweedy Browne Funds produced solid absolute returns, but modestly trailed their respective benchmarks. Of the Tweedy Funds, the Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Value Fund (MUTF:[TBHDX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TBHDX "Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund No Load")) produced the best absolute returns, trailing its benchmark by only a basis point. With the US dollar ([USDOLLAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USDOLLAR "Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index"),[DXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY "US Dollar Index")) weakening against most major foreign currencies during the quarter, our flagship currency hedged International Value Fund (MUTF:[TBGVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TBGVX "Tweedy, Browne International Value Fund Other")) trailed its unhedged benchmark, the MSCI EAFE Index in US dollars, but outperformed the MSCI EAFE Index hedged to US dollars.

The North American equity holdings across all four Funds made a significant contribution to returns during the third quarter, while returns in their European and Japanese components were dampened somewhat by geopolitical risks and concerns around slowing economic growth and the impact of a resurgent Japanese yen.

The Funds’ financial, healthcare, materials, and industrial holdings, for the most part, led returns for the quarter while their consumer discretionary, energy, communication services and information technology holdings produced disappointing results. For the most part, in terms of its industry segments, the Funds’ pharmaceutical stocks, their bank and diversified financial holdings, and chemical holdings led the way while their gas utility, insurance, auto-related, and professional service holdings disappointed.

The International Value and the Value Fund’s (MUTF:[TWEBX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWEBX "Tweedy, Browne Value Fund No Load")) foreign currency hedging policy also detracted from their returns as the US dollar weakened against most major currencies during the period, causing declines in the value of most of their forward hedging contracts. In contrast, the decline in the US dollar gave a boost to the returns of International Value II (MUTF:[TBCUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TBCUX "Tweedy, Browne International Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged Other")) and Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Funds ([TBHDX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TBHDX "Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund No Load")) which remain unhedged.

Top-performing equity contributors included: Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc."), [BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")), Fresenius SE & Co ([OTCPK:FSNUF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSNUF "Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA")), Roche Holding ([OTCQX:RHHBY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY "Roche Holding AG")), United Overseas Bank ([OTCPK:UOVEF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UOVEF "United Overseas Bank Limited")), Winpak ([OTCPK:WIPKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WIPKF "Winpak Ltd.")), and Uni-President China Holdings ([OTCPK:UPCHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPCHY "Uni-President China Holdings Ltd")). Negative contributors included SCOR SE ([OTCPK:SZCRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SZCRF "SCOR SE")), Rubis SCA ([OTCPK:RBSFY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBSFY "Rubis")), Samsung Electronics ([OTCPK:SSNLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.")), Alten SA ([OTCPK:ABLGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABLGF "Alten S.A.")), Husqvarna AB ([OTCPK:HUSQF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUSQF "Husqvarna AB (publ)")), TotalEnergies ([TTE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTE "TotalEnergies SE")), Heineken ([OTCQX:HEINY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HEINY "Heineken N.V.")), Ubisoft ([OTCPK:UBSFY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBSFY "Ubisoft Entertainment SA")), Autoliv ([ALV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALV "Autoliv, Inc.")), and Aalberts NV ([OTCPK:AALBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AALBF "Aalberts N.V.")).

PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY
------------------

*(A list of selected newly established positions, including additions, sales, and trims of existing positions for each Fund, is included with each Fund's portfolio page, beginning on page 4.)*

We established positions in several new names during the quarter, including CVS Group ([CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")), a UK-based company that is in the business of acquiring and growing veterinary practices; Subaru ([OTCPK:FUJHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FUJHY "Subaru Corporation")), the iconically quirky Japanese car company; Sopra Steria ([OTCPK:SPSAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPSAF "Sopra Steria Group SA")), a French company that provides consulting, digital, and software development services; Koito ([OTCPK:KOTMY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOTMY "Koito Manufacturing Co., Ltd.")), a Japanese producer of lighting equipment for automobiles; Kanadevia ([OTCPK:HIZOF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIZOF "Kanadevia Corporation"), formerly Hitachi Zosen Corp.), the Japanese company that develops, manufactures, and sells environmental equipment and facilities including garbage incinerators and industrial waste processing facilities; and Jardine Matheson ([OTCPK:JMHLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMHLY "Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited")), the Singapore-based holding company, which we have owned in the past, that has interests in motor vehicles, property development, food retailing, health and beauty, engineering and construction and a host of other businesses. At purchase, we believe all of these companies were trading at discounts to our conservative estimates of their underlying intrinsic values, were financially strong, and had long runways of potential growth. Among others, we also added to several pre-existing positions including Porsche ([OTCPK:POAHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POAHY "Porsche Automobil Holding SE")), Fuso Chemical, and Shoei ([OTCPK:SHOFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOFF "Shoei Co., Ltd.")).

On the sell side, we sold or pared back several Fund holdings whose stock prices had either reached our estimates of their intrinsic values or had been compromised in some way by declines in our estimates of intrinsic values or future growth prospects. In some instances, we sold or trimmed some positions to make room for new additions or to generate tax losses, which we can use to offset the Funds’ realized capital gains. These include companies such as SCOR ([OTCPK:SZCRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SZCRF "SCOR SE")), Munich Re, KBC ([OTCPK:KBCSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBCSF "KBC Group NV")), Nabtesco ([OTCPK:NCTKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NCTKF "Nabtesco Corporation")), Baidu ([BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU "Baidu, Inc.")), DBS ([OTCPK:DBSDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBSDF "DBS Group Holdings Ltd")), Husqvarna ([OTCPK:HUSQF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUSQF "Husqvarna AB (publ)")), Trelleborg ([OTCPK:TBABF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TBABF "Trelleborg AB (publ)")), and Safran ([OTCPK:SAFRF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAFRF "Safran SA")), among others.

PORTFOLIO POSITIONING AND OUTLOOK
---------------------------------

Portfolio positioning in our Funds remains as one would expect and reflects those areas of the world and parts of global equity markets where we believe investors may still uncover securities trading at discounts from conservative estimates of their respective intrinsic values. *(Of course, value investing involves the risk that the market will not recognize a security’s intrinsic value for a long time, or that a security thought to be undervalued may in fact be appropriately priced.)* European equities continue to carry the largest weight in all four of our Fund portfolios. The same holds for the Funds’ industrial, financial, and healthcare holdings. From a country perspective, the United States, Switzerland, Great Britain, and France also carry considerable weight, and the Japanese exposure in our Fund portfolios has been on the rise over the last several years, as has been the Funds’ exposure to smaller and medium capitalization equities. Cash reserves in the Funds remain quite modest and comprise between 2.9% and 4.6% of Fund portfolio total assets.

The rise of the big US technology “phoenix” from the ashes of its 2022 comeuppance has been nothing short of breathtaking. Bolstered by the prospects for a soft economic landing in which economic growth and the labor markets remain relatively strong while inflation is brought to heel and increasing excitement around all things AI-related, the S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500), [SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) , led by a relatively small group of dominant technology companies, is up cumulatively over 65% for the last 24 months through September 30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")), which carries considerably less technology exposure, is up 53.6%. The MSCI World and EAFE Indices in US dollars are up 61.5% and 56.8%, respectively. All four are trading at, or very near, record highs. Unsurprisingly, popular equity market valuation barometers such as the “Buffett Indicator” and the Shiller Cape Index are also near all-time highs. In this undeniably ebullient market environment, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A "Berkshire Hathaway Inc."), [BRK.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.")) has accumulated a reported cash hoard of approximately $325 billion and, according to recent reports, owns more Treasury Bills than the US Federal Reserve. With public and private debt at unprecedented levels, excluding wartime, and parts of the world on fire with conflicts that could possibly metastasize, one can’t help but wonder if the market is missing something. Hard to know, but as we have written in previous commentaries, this is no time for investors to remain complacent. In fact, it’s probably a good time for investors to pull out their dog-eared copy of Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and re-read Chapter 20, entitled “Margin of Safety.”

Thank you for investing with us.
