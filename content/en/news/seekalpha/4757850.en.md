Shares of Kilroy Realty Corporation (NYSE:[KRC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KRC "Kilroy Realty Corporation")) have largely missed out on the equity rally over the past year, trading essentially flat as it has contended with higher interest rates and a difficult office leasing environment. Shares are now down about 20% from their 52-week highs as long-term interest rates have risen, which is a headwind for real estate valuations. I last covered shares in [October 2023](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643578-kilroy-realty-secular-headwinds-shares-unattractive-q3-results), rating the stock a “sell” given my concerns about office vacancy rates in California, and since then, the stock has returned 36%, lagging the market’s 45% gain. With updated financials, now is a good time to revisit KRC. I remain bearish.

Kilroy Realty's West Coast Focus has been a headwind
----------------------------------------------------

In the company’s [fourth quarter](https://investors.kilroyrealty.com/investors/press-room/news-details/2025/Kilroy-Realty-Corporation-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Financial-Results/default.aspx), Kilroy generated $1.20 of funds from operations (FFO), which was $0.17 ahead of [consensus](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405848-kilroy-realty-ffo-of-1_20-beats-by-0_17-revenue-of-286_38m-beats-by-6_23m). For the year, FFO was down less than 1% to $4.59. During the quarter, the company sold its corporate aircraft for $20 million, booking a $0.05 gain. As a reminder, Kilroy is an office REIT that primarily operates on the West Coast, with the San Francisco Bay Area half of its business.

The San Francisco office market has been particularly weak since COVID, as many technology employers moved to a more remote approach. More recently, we have seen some like Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) pull back from this policy, but the tech industry is still generally more open to remote work than other industries. This has weighed on occupancy, and the glut of office space has had a deflationary pressure on rents across industries. As you can see, the technology industry accounts for more than half of its rental revenue.

The completion of development work has helped to lift revenue nearly 8% from last year. However, revenue of $287 million was down 1% sequentially, as the company had 3 large tenants move out during Q4, which will weigh on results into 2025. Thanks to cost rationalization efforts, property expenses rose just 4% to $63 million. Property taxes of $24 million were up more meaningfully, nearly 15%, due to the completion of development activity.

### Declining occupancy is beginning to weigh

Same-store revenue was up 2% while expenses rose by 5% for a 0.7% increase in net operating income. For the year, net operating income was down 1%. This Q4 increase is likely to be a blip, in my view, as further declines are likely. Even with 700k square feet of leasing in Q4, Kilroy’s 82.8% stabilized occupancy was down 150bs sequentially and 3% from last year with LA and Austin the weakest at 75%. Additionally, even though there was solid re-leasing activity, cash rents decreased by 8.6% on second generation leasing. This deflation will weigh on results.

This lower level of occupancy is going to pressure margins, and unfortunately, occupancy is likely to fall further in 2025 given the impact of those late 2024 move-outs and another 3 move-outs or downsizes [expected](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757193-kilroy-realty-corporation-krc-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) in Q1. As a consequence, management expects occupancy to fall 3% in 2025. This is likely to cause at least a 1.5% drop in same-store NOI and translate to $3.85 to $4.05 of 2025 FFO

### 2025 is unlikely the bottom, given lease maturity schedule

My primary concern is that 2025 is unlikely to represent the bottom for the business. That is because there are limited 2025 lease expirations. After the Q1 non-renewals, the balance of the year should be fairly stable. In 2026, 12% of its base rent matures. With occupancy falling in 2025 during a year of low expirations, it is difficult not to see occupancy fall even further in 2026, which will likely lead to further FFO declines. Beyond 2026, I would note in 2028 and beyond, its average rent per square foot is generally near or above $60, which means we are likely to see ongoing second-generation rent deflation.

Additionally, the company has a steady stream of annual debt maturities of about $400 million a year over the next three years. Assuming it refinances at 5-5.5% given the current interest rate environment, that will be an additional $0.03 per year of FFO pressure. This ~1% headwind just adds to the pressure the business faces from the difficult leasing environment.

### KRC shares are not sufficiently cheap, despite the book value discount

Now, shares are trading at a discount to its $5.4 billion book equity value, which is about $45 per share. The market is essentially saying KRC is worth about $1.2 billion less than the carrying values on its balance sheet. It currently has $9.8 billion of real estate assets on its balance sheet. The market is assigning a ~13% haircut to these properties. Considering the pressures in the office sector and the negative impact on valuations from higher interest rates, this does not strike me as unreasonable or altogether too pessimistic. I do not see a discount to book value as being a reason to buy shares.

Kilroy does have a 6% dividend yield. In 2024, it generated distributable FFO of $3.71, which factors in $93 million of maintenance of cap-ex. That gives shares a 10.6% earnings yield and ~1.7x dividend coverage. Given this dividend coverage, I do view the payout as safe at least into 2026. With this distributable yield, KRC does not need to grow to generate a solid return for investors.

However, not only is KRC not growing, but its cash flow is shrinking. Even assuming it can moderate maintenance spending down to $80 million, distributable FFO in 2025 is unlikely to be above $3.20, giving shares a forward 9% yield. As discussed above, given its leasing schedule and higher debt costs, 2025 is highly unlikely to represent a bottom for the business-2026 is the soonest that could be.

I view a 5% decline in 2026 distributable FFO as a fairly benign outcome, or $3-3.05. At an 8.6% yield, there is not much room for further declines. While new development activity should provide some tailwind, the higher per square foot rental rate will be an ongoing headwind, and a flattish FFO outcome over 2028-2030 would be positive. KRC is functionally running on a treadmill—where it needs to move quickly just to stay in place.

With downside to $30, KRC stock is a sell
-----------------------------------------

With FFO likely to fall for two years, I do not view an ~8.6% forward distributable yield as particularly compelling, given there is ongoing downside risk beyond 2026. I see a downside to $30, or a 10% 2026 distributable yield. That would provide protection from a 2% ongoing decline rate and still result in a market-like 8% return. This price target leaves shares with 14% of downside. As such, I continue to be cautious on shares and rate them a “sell.” Even after their recent pullback, more downside likely remains.
