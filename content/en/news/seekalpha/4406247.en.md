Earnings Call Insights: Unitil Corporation (NYSE:[UTL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTL "Unitil Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Chairman and CEO Thomas Meissner announced that Unitil reported adjusted earnings of $47.8 million or $2.97 per share for 2024, an increase of $0.15 per share compared to 2023, achieving a consolidated return on equity of 9.4%. The company expects long-term earnings growth of 5%-7%.
* The acquisition of Bangor Natural Gas was completed on January 31, 2025, for $70.9 million plus $0.3 million for working capital. Meissner stated that the acquisition is "highly complementary" to existing gas operations in Maine and is expected to be earnings accretive over the long term.
* Operational highlights included top quartile electric reliability and gas safety metrics. Unitil also completed a 14-year gas infrastructure modernization program in Maine, replacing aging infrastructure.
* CFO Daniel Hurstak reported that the 2024 adjusted electric gross margin was $107.3 million, reflecting higher distribution rates and customer growth, while the gas gross margin was $166.9 million. Decoupling mechanisms supported gas gross margin by $0.28 per share.

### Outlook

* Unitil provided 2025 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.01 to $3.17 per share, assuming normal weather and consistent customer growth. Long-term EPS growth is reaffirmed at 5%-7%.
* The company outlined a $980 million five-year investment plan through 2029, representing a 46% increase over the prior five years. This capital plan is expected to grow the rate base by 6.5%-8.5% annually.
* Upcoming regulatory actions include a planned distribution rate case filing for Unitil Energy Systems in New Hampshire during Q2 2025 to recover costs for the Kingston Solar facility.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted net income for 2024 was $47.8 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared to 2023. Higher distribution rates and customer growth drove the results, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
* Operation and maintenance expenses increased by $2 million, including $1 million in transaction costs related to the Bangor acquisition. Depreciation and amortization rose by $8.7 million due to higher depreciation rates and additional utility plant in service.
* Interest expense increased marginally due to higher short-term borrowings and long-term debt levels.
* Capital spending for 2025 is projected at $176 million, with investments focused on electric system modernization and the completion of pipeline replacements.

### Q&A

* Alex, Guggenheim Partners: "On the intent to file the distribution rate case at UES, can you walk through the strategy there and provide a sense of customer bill impacts?"
  + Thomas Meissner: "We are assessing the revenue deficiency but do not have specific bill impacts to share yet. The case will likely be filed in May or June, driven by the need to align earned ROE with allowed ROE."
* Alex, Guggenheim Partners: "Regarding the 5-year capital plan, how should we think about the timing and means of equity issuance?"
  + Meissner: "Approximately 13% of the plan will come from equity, but we have no immediate plans for issuance. The increased revolver provides financing flexibility."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed neutral to slightly positive sentiment, focusing on the Bangor acquisition and capital spending plans. Questions reflected interest in regulatory actions and financing strategies.
