Earnings Call Insights: International Petroleum Corporation ([OTCPK:IPCFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPCFF "International Petroleum Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO William Lundin highlighted that 2024 was a "milestone year" for the company with record investments totaling $442 million, $350 million of which was allocated to the Blackrod Phase 1 development project. He stated that the project remains on time and on budget.
* The company achieved average production of 47,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for 2024, within its guidance range of 46,000 to 48,000 boepd. Operating expenses per boe averaged $17 for the year, slightly below initial guidance.
* Lundin noted that excluding Blackrod-related growth CapEx, the company generated $216 million in free cash flow from its base operations. Including the growth CapEx, free cash flow stood at (-$135 million).
* CFO Christophe Nerguararian reported that Q4 operating cash flow was just under $80 million, with EBITDA for the same quarter exceeding $75 million. He emphasized the "very strong" cash flow generation despite increased spending on Blackrod.

### Outlook

* Management anticipates spending approximately $250 million on Blackrod development in 2025, representing the majority of remaining CapEx for the project. Specific guidance for 2025 will be provided at the upcoming Capital Markets Day.
* The company renewed its share repurchase program, authorizing the buyback of up to 7.5 million shares by the end of 2025.
* Lundin indicated that future capital allocation decisions will focus on maximizing shareholder value, with continued emphasis on share buybacks if the company remains undervalued.

### Financial Results

* Operating cash flow for 2024 totaled $342 million, in line with the company’s most recent guidance. Full-year revenues reached $800 million, with a gross profit of $210 million and net profit exceeding $100 million.
* Net debt at year-end increased to $209 million, compared to a net cash position at the start of 2024. Gross cash reserves stood at $247 million.
* Operating costs for Q4 were $18.20 per boe, reflecting slightly higher gas prices. Full-year operating costs averaged $17 per boe, benefiting from lower-than-expected electricity and gas expenses.

### Q&A

* Teodor Nilsen, SB1 Markets, asked about the 2025 CapEx outlook and share repurchase strategy. CEO Lundin reiterated that Blackrod's CapEx will dominate 2025 spending, with approximately $250 million remaining. He confirmed the company would prioritize share buybacks if it continues trading at a discount.
* Tom Erik Kristiansen, Pareto, inquired about M&A opportunities given the company’s strong balance sheet. Lundin said IPC remains "opportunistic" and would consider acquisitions that align with its growth strategy without overleveraging.
* Mark Wilson, Jefferies, questioned the strategic role of IPC’s international assets. Lundin emphasized their high-quality Brent-linked production and significant free cash flow contributions, noting they account for approximately SEK20 per share of IPC’s net asset value.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed a slightly positive sentiment, focusing on Blackrod’s on-time progress and the company’s shareholder return strategy. Questions about M&A opportunities and potential delays reflected cautious optimism about IPC’s growth trajectory.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding Blackrod’s execution and cash flow generation. Lundin’s statements included phrases like "very well positioned" and "tracking in line with expectations," reinforcing the company’s operational confidence.
* Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment improved moderately, driven by Blackrod’s progress and consistent financial performance.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language remained consistent, with continued confidence in meeting production and cost targets. However, management provided additional visibility into 2025 Blackrod spending.
* Analysts’ questions shifted from immediate operational performance to strategic priorities, particularly M&A and post-Blackrod growth.
* Financial metrics improved marginally, with production rising from 45,000 boepd in Q3 to 47,400 boepd in Q4. Operating costs remained stable, but Q4 free cash flow was negative due to peak Blackrod spending.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged potential risks related to weather events and logistical challenges in Blackrod’s equipment delivery and installation. However, Lundin noted that contingency measures, including a $110 million provision, are in place.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential delays in Blackrod’s schedule and the impact of volatile oil and gas prices. Management emphasized robust cost controls and hedging strategies to mitigate these risks.
* Regulatory risks were highlighted, particularly regarding Canada’s proposed emissions cap. Lundin stated IPC is assessing carbon capture and storage technologies to align with potential regulations.

### Final Takeaway

International Petroleum Corporation concluded 2024 with strong operational and financial performance, driven by disciplined cost management and progress on the Blackrod Phase 1 project. With $250 million in Blackrod-related CapEx slated for 2025, the company remains focused on delivering shareholder value through share buybacks and opportunistic M&A. Despite industry challenges, IPC’s robust balance sheet and strategic priorities position it for continued growth and operational excellence.
