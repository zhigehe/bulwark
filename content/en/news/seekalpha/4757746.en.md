Back in August, I pointed out that few companies in Industrials had outperformed Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:[PH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PH "Parker-Hannifin Corporation")) since early 2022. The company has an incredible record of increasing revenue and earnings, a share repurchase program, and a dividend with a double-digit CAGR. Over the past three years, it has delivered an excellent 125% total return.

Since [my earlier analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4715220-parker-hannifin-premium-dividend-growth-at-a-premium-price), the stock has risen another 18%, but signs of a slowdown may be emerging. [S&P Global recently forecast](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/250113-great-capexpectations-tech-utility-spending-power-capital-goods-revenue-growth-in-2025-13381132) deteriorating global capital expenditure growth, from 5.5% in 2024 to 4.2% this year, with tight monetary policy impacting a range of industrial companies. [Reuters likewise has discussed](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asias-factories-end-2024-weak-footing-trump-20-risks-mount-2025-01-02) slowing factory activity in Asia, Europe, and the U.S., with expectations for 2025 souring on account of trade risks and China’s fragile economic recovery.

With industrial spending under pressure, Parker-Hannifin’s valuation in February 2025 leaves little room for error. The stock is now trading ~3.5% below its all-time high and at a P/E of ~28x, a multiple well above its five-year average and that of many peers.

In this update, I review the company’s operations, unpack the latest quarter, and take a fresh look at valuation. While I remain impressed by its quality, I’m downgrading Parker-Hannifin to **Sell** based on valuation concerns. There may be no urgency to exit for existing shareholders, but for new investors, there may be better opportunities for industrials exposure.

The Business Model
------------------

Parker-Hannifin is a century-old company that describes itself as a global leader in [motion and control technologies](https://www.parker.com/us/en/divisions/electronic-motion-and-control-division.html), supplying a wide array of industries. Most of its products are highly specialized—frankly unfamiliar to the average consumer. Perhaps most useful is a snapshot of where they’re used, as this gives a clearer picture of the company’s role across the economy. The bullets below outline draw on descriptions provided by [CSIMarket](https://csimarket.com/stocks/segments.php?code=PH).

Diversified Industrial (~70% of sales)

Includes motion-control systems, hydraulic components, fluid connectors, and filtration products.

* *Manufacturing and Automation* – Used in robotics, factory automation, metal fabrication, chemical processing, and semiconductor manufacturing.
* *Transportation* – Provides braking, power transmission, and motion-control technologies for commercial vehicles, railroads, and heavy equipment in construction, mining, and agriculture.
* *Energy* – Supplies hydraulic, thermal management, and filtration components for the oil and gas industry (e.g., drilling rigs, refining, and pipeline infrastructure), renewables and power generation (e.g., in wind turbines, power plants, and energy storage systems), and HVAC/refrigeration (e.g., for industrial climate control and commercial cooling applications).

Aerospace Systems (~30% of sales)

Provides flight control systems, hydraulic components, and engine technologies for:

* *Aviation* – Supplying Airbus ([OTCPK:EADSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY "Airbus SE")), Boeing ([BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA "The Boeing Company")), and other major OEMs such as Lockheed Martin ([LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT "Lockheed Martin Corporation")), Northrop Grumman ([NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC "Northrop Grumman Corporation")), and others.
* *Defense and Airspace* – Supporting military aircraft, satellites, and defense systems.
* *Aftermarket services* – A range of products meeting the growing demand for maintenance and spare parts.

Recent Results and Guidance
---------------------------

The company [reported Q2 FY25 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401005-parker-hannifin-raises-fy25-aerospace-growth-to-11-percent-amid-strong-aftermarket-demand) in late January, with a mixed performance reflecting strength in aerospace but persistent challenges in its larger industrials segment. A quick summary:

* Total revenue of $4.7B down 1.6% YoY.
* Net income up 39% YoY to $949M.
* Adjusted EPS came in at $6.53, up 6%.
* Operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 25.6%.

There was a divergence across segments, with Aerospace Systems seeing 14% organic growth while Diversified Industrial declined by 4.1%, weighed down by:

* Lower demand for automation and manufacturing equipment, reflecting weaker industrial spending. Global manufacturing [PMIs have been trending lower](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/02/eurozone-manufacturing-recovery-uk-orders), a sign of declining new orders and industrial activity.
* Sluggish transportation and [heavy vehicle markets](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/volvo-expects-flat-markets-next-year-as-customers-remain-cautious-e2b9f1bc) (WSJ: subscription required), with evidence of customers delaying large equipment purchases.
* Continued weakness in international markets, as higher interest rates have slowed investment. For instance, data indicates that industrial production in the Eurozone [contracted by ~2%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/euro-zone-industrial-production-falls-more-than-expected-sept-2024-11-14/) last quarter, impacting Parker-Hannifin’s operations in that region.

Parker-Hannifin Q2 Presentation Slides





Despite these challenges, management raised its FY25 EPS guidance to $26.35–$27.05, just above prior expectations. The company projects organic growth at ~2% led by another 11% increase in Aerospace revenue. Management also expects adjusted operating margins to edge up slightly to 25.8%.

Mixed Near-Term Prospects
-------------------------

My August 2024 essay recognized Parker-Hannifin as a well-run manufacturer that’s made smart acquisitions and operational improvements while maintaining disciplined financial management, all of which supported its stock’s outperformance. While the long-term case remains intact—and by long-term, I mean years and not months—prospective investors should consider the near-term challenges.

The Aerospace Segment has recently been the growth driver, benefitting from increased aircraft production and aftermarket demand. The latter now makes up over half the segment’s revenue, bringing some margin stability to the business as a whole. But conversely, the Diversified Industrial segment, while historically strong, is facing headwinds from slowing capex in industrial automation and transportation as well as [weaker demand in China’s manufacturing sector](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731721-parker-hannifin-corporation-ph-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript).

From a capital allocation standpoint, I like that Parker-Hannifin has reduced net debt leverage to 1.9x while growing the dividend at a fast clip over the past few years:

| **Shareholder Returns** | |
| --- | --- |
| Years of Growth | 68 |
| Forward Yield | 0.96% |
| Buyback Yield | 0.44% |
| 5Y CAGR | 13.12% |
| Payout Ratio | 24.5% |

Note that while [Seeking Alpha’s data](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PH/dividends/scorecard) currently shows a dividend growth streak of 8 years, Parker-Hannifin has actually increased its dividend for [68 consecutive years](https://investors.parker.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/457/parker-increases-quarterly-cash-dividend-10-to-1-63-per).

In sum, despite its many strengths, the company’s larger segment is contending with cyclical pressures, and at current valuations, the stock already reflects much of its fundamental quality. With shares trading near all-time highs, the risk/reward balance is less compelling.

Valuation Concerns
------------------

Back in August, I saw Parker-Hannifin as overvalued compared both to the broader Industrials sector and the company’s own historical benchmarks. That’s still the case today:

|  | **Current** | **Sector** | **5Y AVG** | **Difference** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P/E GAAP TTM | 28.1x | 24.1x | 25.4x | +10.8% |
| Dividend Yield (TTM) | 0.96% | 1.41% | 1.43% | -33.1% |

EPS projections for this and next year have ticked up slightly, but FY27 is now expected to come in a bit lower than previously guided:

* FY25 – $26.76
* FY26 – $29.39
* FY27 – $31.91

Combined, it equates to a forward CAGR of 9.2%, well below the 18.2% CAGR of the past five years.

At 25.4x earnings (the company’s five-year historical P/E), the implied price at the FY25 EPS of $26.76 is $680, essentially where the stock trades today. This suggests Parker-Hannifin is already priced to perfection, leaving little room for multiple expansion unless the company delivers earnings surprises / outpaces current growth forecasts. (For context, prior to the pandemic, Industrials traded collectively in the range of 20x–22x forward P/E.)

Verdict
-------

Parker-Hannifin is a well-managed Industrials leader with an especially thriving aerospace segment (+14% YoY in the recent quarter), strong cash flow generation (+40% YoY increase), and disciplined financial management (evidenced by declining net debt leverage and operating margins). But industrial softness, potentially weaker capital expenditures, and global macro uncertainty are near-term headwinds.

At 28x earnings, the stock trades at a premium to both its historical valuation and sector peers, leaving little margin of error. I have therefore downgraded Parker-Hannifin to **Sell**, specifically for new investors seeking an attractive entry point.
