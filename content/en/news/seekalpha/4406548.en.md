Grain futures on the Chicago Board of Trade turned negative Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture's WASDE report left U.S. production, ending stocks and demand all unchanged from the previous month.

CBOT corn ([C\_1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C_1:COM "Corn Futures")) for March delivery closed -1.6% to $4.83 3/4 per bushel, March soybeans ([S\_1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S_1:COM "Soybeans Futures")) settled -0.6% to $10.43 1/2 per bushel, and March wheat ([W\_1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/W_1:COM "Wheat Futures")) finished -0.5% at $5.76 3/4 per bushel.

ETFs: (NYSEARCA:[CORN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORN "Teucrium Corn Fund ETF")), (NYSEARCA:[SOYB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOYB "Teucrium Soybean Fund ETF")), (NYSEARCA:[WEAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEAT "Teucrium Wheat Fund ETF")), ([DBA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBA "Invesco DB Agriculture ETF")), ([MOO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOO "VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF"))

U.S. grains fell after the [WASDE report](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde0225.pdf "WASDE report") left much of the USDA's domestic outlook [unchanged](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202502119189/corn-futures-drop-after-wasde-keeps-estimates-unchanged-daily-grain-highlights "unchanged") from the previous month, even as world projections showed a tighter biew for corn and soybeans, after analysts and traders were anticipating higher corn demand through domestic consumption and export sales, which had supported recent gains.

The USDA report was a "dud," Naomi Blohm of Total Farm Marketing said, but the lack of excitement around U.S. corn and soybean crops sent those futures lower after its release.

At the same time, the USDA trimmed its estimates for corn and soybean crops in Argentina and Brazil, lowering Argentina's forecast for soybean production by 3M metric tons and corn in both countries by 1M tons each.

For soybeans, the output expected from Brazil in 2025 remains massive, Doug Bergman of RCM Alternatives said, and "the record crop in Brazil will keep global supplies on track to be record large."
