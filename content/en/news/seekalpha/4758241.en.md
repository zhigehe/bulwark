| Please see the last page for important GIPS® disclosures.  **Past performance cannot guarantee future** **results.** Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value. Returns greater than one year are annualized. Returns are expressed in U.S. dollars. All returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.  \*Pure gross performance results do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs, fees or expenses and returns will be reduced by such advisory fee and other contractual expenses as described in the individual contract and Form ADV Part 2A. Pure gross returns are supplemental to net returns.  Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable Managed Account fee (3.00% annually, or 0.25% monthly) from the pure gross or gross composite return. The Managed Account fee includes all charges for trading costs, portfolio management, custody and other administrative fees. Actual fees may vary depending on, among other things, the applicable fee schedule and portfolio size. The fees are available on request and may be found in Form ADV Part 2A. |

Investment environment
----------------------

* Healthcare stocks underperformed the broader market, with most subsectors dragged lower by the controversial nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
* Healthcare services were further pressured by President-elect Donald Trump’s call to eliminate pharmacy benefit managers owned by insurers and the tragic killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO.
* A pickup in Treasury yields made long-duration assets such as biotech less attractive to investors. Clinical trial setbacks also caused sentiment toward biopharma to sour, including AbbVie’s ([ABBV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBV "AbbVie Inc.")) closely watched schizophrenia therapy, which failed to outperform a placebo in two phase 3 trials. Novo Nordisk’s ([NVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO "Novo Nordisk A/S"))([OTCPK:NONOF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NONOF "Novo Nordisk A/S")) new obesity therapy, CagriSema, also fell short of expectations for weight loss, and Vertex’s ([VRTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated")) novel pain therapy failed in a mid-stage study for lower back and leg pain.
* Even so, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closed out the year with several drug approvals, including Crenessity, a novel approach to lowering the need for high-dose steroid therapy in patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Other approvals included Bizengri for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, Unloxcyt for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and Alyftrek for the treatment of specific mutations of cystic fibrosis.
* Eli Lilly ([LLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY "Eli Lilly and Company")) also received the first approval to treat sleep apnea with Zepbound, adding another large indication to GLP-1 drugs.

Portfolio review
----------------

Looking at individual holdings, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals ([MDGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDGL "Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) was the top contributor. The company is focused on developing therapies for metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH), or fatty liver disease, which affects over 10 million adults in the U.S. and is a leading cause of liver failure. Madrigal reported third-quarter revenues for MASH treatment Rezdiffra that doubled consensus expectations. The company also achieved its 80% commercial-coverage goal earlier than expected. Finally, shares responded positively after Novo Nordisk reported modest efficacy for its GLP-1 drug semaglutide for MASH, possibly bringing the pharma giant’s marketing prowess to build the MASH market, while still leaving room for Rezdiffra to augment activity.

Argenx ([ARGX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGX "argenx SE"))([OTCPK:ARGNF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGNF "argenx SE")) was another top contributor. Shares outperformed after the firm’s third-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, helped by the growth of Vyvgart for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, as well as the drug’s successful launch for a second indication – chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIPD). Argenx also moved Vyvgart into phase 3 development for another autoimmune disease, myositis, after promising mid-stage data.

Other holdings weighed on performance, including Vaxcyte ([PCVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCVX "Vaxcyte, Inc.")). The company is developing VAX-31, a novel 31-valent vaccine designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease.

Vaccine makers came under pressure following the nomination of Kennedy, an outspoken vaccine skeptic, to lead HHS. However, Kennedy has stated he would not stop patients from accessing vaccines, a position we think will be critical to Kennedy being confirmed by the Senate. This year, in a phase 2 study, VAX-31 showed it was effective against all 31 strains of pneumococcal disease — 11 more so than the competing vaccine, Prevnar 20. Vaxcyte is now planning a late-stage study, which could eventually allow the company to compete in this $7 billion-plus market.

Avidity Biosciences ([RNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNA "Avidity Biosciences, Inc.")) was another significant detractor. The small-cap biotech is developing antibody oligonucleotide conjugates that aim to modify RNA function and gene expression. Shares surged to a record high in November but succumbed to profit taking amid a sell-off in biotech in December. Investors also grew nervous in anticipation of competitor data, due in January. Avidity continues to execute across its platform, including for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), where earlier in the year the company delivered positive initial data. Avidity also is enrolling patients in a phase 3 trial for type 1 myotonic dystrophy, with data expected in early 2026, and is on track to submit a new drug application for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment by the end of 2025.

Manager outlook
---------------

Healthcare has underperformed the S&P 500 Index ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index"))([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) for two consecutive years amid a surge in enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and other headwinds, such as a post-pandemic rebalancing and elevated interest rates. Policy uncertainty has also returned. The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to lead HHS caused healthcare stocks to pull back at the end of 2024, even as the rest of the market cheered the expected pro-growth policies of President-elect Donald Trump. We think this could create more volatility in the near term, as we await Kennedy’s confirmation hearing, and as speculation continues about possible healthcare reforms.

However, unlike other areas of the equity market, healthcare stocks now trade at a deep discount to the S&P 500. At current valuations, we believe the sector has already priced in significant downside scenarios from potential policy changes. The sector could also be set up for a potential relief rally as the Trump administration’s plans come into focus.

Healthcare reform, for example, is likely to take second billing to other priorities, such as tax legislation, tariffs, and immigration. And some aspects of the Trump agenda could benefit the sector, including lower taxes and a more accommodative Federal Trade Commission.

In the meantime, innovation — healthcare’s biggest driver of long-term returns — has been accelerating. GLP-1 weight- loss drugs are already generating over $50 billion in annual sales, while new devices in robotic surgery and atrial fibrillation are driving accelerating revenue growth in large markets. Over the past two years, the FDA has approved more than 130 novel therapies, including the first non-opioid pain medication in decades, and Ascendis’ replacement therapy for patients with hypoparathyroidism. Industry pipelines remain at record levels, with important late-stage readouts due in 2025, including the first pivotal data for oral GLP-1 therapies for obesity and new treatments for cardiovascular disease caused by elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), which affects up to 25% of the population.

Encouragingly, interest in healthcare’s innovation has been growing. In 2024, biotech stocks gained an average of 31% following a positive catalyst event (such as a strong clinical trial readout), compared with an average of only 13% in 2022, when the sector was in a bear market. Biotech companies with robust pipelines were also able to raise capital, with the sector delivering its second-largest year of equity issuance in the past decade.

As such, we remain excited about the opportunities in healthcare, including small- and mid-cap biotechs with newly launching products or promising late-stage pipelines. We also favor pharma companies with improving growth potential and medical device makers with innovative product launches, which so far have escaped unwanted political attention.

Finally, we remain positive on leading health insurers. These companies are integral to the administration of healthcare in the U.S. and, in our view, are best placed to innovate solutions that could improve value for the system. They could also see profit margins expand after adjusting 2025 benefits for rising costs.

Overall, we feel the healthcare sector today is characterized by both rising innovation and discounted valuations. We also believe the sector’s defensive qualities could become more appreciated should the broader market — now priced for perfection, in our view — hit a speedbump.
