Earnings Call Insights: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation ([OTCPK:NTTYY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTTYY "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation")) Q3 2024

### Management View

* Operating revenue for the third quarter reached JPY10,049.7 billion, marking a record high, supported by growth in the Smart Life Business at Docomo and positive foreign exchange impacts of JPY125 billion. However, operating profit decreased by JPY87 billion to JPY1,399.2 billion due to declining communication service revenues and measures to strengthen Docomo’s customer base. Representative Member of the Board and SEVP Takashi Hiroi acknowledged the challenge of achieving the annual profit target but emphasized efforts to reduce costs and improve sales quality.
* The Integrated ICT business saw profit growth in the Smart Life segment but was impacted by lower communication service revenues. The Global Solutions segment recorded year-on-year growth in public, financial, and corporate sector sales, supported by foreign exchange effects and strong performance in the data center business.
* Hiroi highlighted efforts in regional revitalization and urban development, including planned openings of hotels, parks, and cultural facilities for Expo 2025 in Osaka, and the expansion of data centers in India to strengthen their leadership in the market.
* CFO Hiroi remarked on cost structure reforms, noting Docomo's initiatives to review outsourcing operations and improve network efficiency, while addressing the pressure of increased marketing expenses.

### Outlook

* Management acknowledged challenges in achieving profit targets for the fiscal year due to increased marketing costs and competitive pressures in the communication segment. Hiroi emphasized the importance of maintaining market share and reinforcing customer base efforts to secure medium-term profitability.
* The company plans to expand its data center operations in India and aims to leverage AI-driven solutions for cost efficiencies and revenue growth across various business units. Specific revenue targets for these initiatives were not disclosed.
* Dividend payments are expected to steadily increase, and share buybacks will continue flexibly, backed by controlled cash flow despite anticipated profit declines.

### Financial Results

* Operating revenue set a record for Q3 at JPY10,049.7 billion, up JPY332.9 billion year-on-year, driven by growth in domestic and global revenue and contributions from the Smart Life Business.
* Operating profit fell by JPY87 billion to JPY1,399.2 billion due to declining communication service revenues and increased marketing costs at Docomo, alongside the effects of slowing non-core asset activities.
* Net profit decreased by JPY160.4 billion year-on-year to JPY850.7 billion, impacted by lower operating profit and the absence of stock sale gains seen in the prior year.
* EBITDA for the quarter was JPY2,552.5 billion, reflecting a year-on-year decline of JPY19.2 billion.

### Q&A

* Daisaku Masuno, Nomura Securities, raised concerns about the performance of the Integrated ICT business, particularly the consumer communication segment. Hiroi acknowledged the difficulty in achieving revenue recovery and emphasized the importance of building a strong customer base, despite short-term profit impacts.
* Masuno also inquired about the enterprise segment, noting weaker profitability and revenue trends. Hiroi highlighted challenges in the SME market and plans to reinforce network business and AI capabilities to drive growth.
* Satoru Kikuchi, SMBC Nikko Securities, questioned potential cost reduction measures. Hiroi outlined ongoing structural reforms at Docomo, including consolidation of distribution outlets and increased network efficiency, but admitted that achieving significant short-term impacts would be difficult.
* Kazuki Tokunaga, Daiwa Securities, asked about mid-term investment plans and EBITDA trends. Hiroi acknowledged slower-than-expected returns and highlighted the need to accelerate growth investments in data centers and digitalization efforts.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, focusing on medium-term strategies and cost reduction efforts. Hiroi defended the company's position, stating, "We believe we can control the cash flow to conduct share buybacks and dividend increases as planned."
* Compared to prepared remarks, management exhibited a more defensive tone during the Q&A, particularly when addressing competition and profit erosion in the communication segment.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Comparison to the previous quarter was not available due to the absence of a prior transcript.
* Analysts' focus this quarter centered on profitability challenges in the Integrated ICT business and the effectiveness of cost reduction measures at Docomo.
* Management's confidence in medium-term growth initiatives, such as AI-driven solutions and data center expansions, remains consistent despite short-term pressures.

### Risks and Concerns

* Intensified competition in the communication services market, particularly in the mobile and fixed-line segments, poses a risk to revenue and profitability.
* The Integrated ICT business is under pressure to recover revenue from weaker SME market performance.
* Marketing expenses and the cost of strengthening the customer base at Docomo are impacting short-term profitability, with limited room for immediate cost reductions.
* Inflation and its impact on pricing strategies were noted as challenges, particularly in the public utility segments.

### Final Takeaway

NTT faced significant challenges in Q3 2024, with profit declines driven by competitive pressures and increased marketing costs in key segments. Despite record-high operating revenue, short-term profitability remains under pressure. Management emphasized a focus on medium-term growth, leveraging AI solutions and expanding data center operations to drive future performance.
