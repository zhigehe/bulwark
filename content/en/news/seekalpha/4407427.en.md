Earnings Call Insights: Mirion Technologies (NYSE:[MIR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MIR "Mirion Technologies, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Tom Logan highlighted record quarterly and full-year financial performance, with revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS achieving new highs. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points for the full year, and adjusted EPS increased from $0.34 to $0.41 year-over-year.
* Approximately 49% of expected 2025 revenue is already in the backlog, compared to 46% at the start of 2024. Logan emphasized the company's "category of one position" within nuclear instrumentation, benefiting from strong global nuclear power demand.
* Strategic partnerships were a focus, including agreements with Siemens Healthineers, Electronics Corporation of India, and EDF, the world's largest nuclear power operator. The EDF agreement designates Mirion as the exclusive supplier for nuclear new build projects over the next 20 years.
* CFO Brian Schopfer reported fourth-quarter revenue of $254.3 million, a 10.4% year-over-year increase, with organic growth of 10.3%. Adjusted EBITDA reached $69.6 million, reflecting a 14% year-over-year increase, and adjusted EPS was $0.17 for the quarter.

### Outlook

* 2025 guidance includes adjusted EPS of $0.45 to $0.50 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.5% to 25.5%. Revenue growth is projected at 4% to 6%, with organic growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, despite a 190 basis point foreign exchange headwind.
* Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be between $85 million and $110 million, representing a 50% increase at the midpoint compared to 2024. Capital expenditures are projected to decline by 18% in 2025.
* Management outlined plans for adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in all quarters of 2025, driven by procurement savings, operating leverage, and operational improvements.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue grew to $254.3 million, driven by 13.9% organic growth in the Nuclear & Safety segment and strong performance in nuclear medicine and dosimetry.
* The Nuclear & Safety segment achieved a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $52.8 million, with margins expanding by 180 basis points to 31.3%. Full-year segment revenue grew 8.7% to $561.1 million.
* The Medical segment saw a 5.2% increase in Q4 revenue to $85.5 million, with 3.7% organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment grew 6.1% to $33.2 million, with margins improving by 30 basis points to 38.8%.
* Adjusted free cash flow was $53 million for the quarter and $65 million for the full year, in line with guidance.

### Q&A

* Chris Moore, CJS Securities, inquired about the potential growth of nuclear as a percentage of total revenue. CEO Logan noted that nuclear represented 37% of 2024 revenue and is expected to grow further in 2025, driven by strong demand and a robust pipeline of organic and M&A opportunities.
* Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs, asked about the timing of large nuclear orders and near-term opportunities. Logan estimated that $300 million to $400 million in large nuclear orders would materialize over the next five quarters, emphasizing the strength of the installed base and recurring revenue.
* Vlad Bystricky, Citigroup, discussed Medical segment wildcards for 2025. Logan identified potential upside from improving Chinese market dynamics and post-conflict rebuilding in Ukraine, but noted that guidance assumes no improvement in these areas.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed a cautiously optimistic tone, focusing on nuclear growth opportunities and the company's strategic positioning. Questions were largely constructive but probed for clarity on order timelines and macroeconomic uncertainties.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly in prepared remarks, highlighting margin improvement and strategic partnerships. During Q&A, responses were measured and provided detailed clarifications, with no indication of defensive or evasive language.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone reflected increased confidence in 2025 guidance and longer-term growth prospects, particularly in nuclear power and radiopharmaceuticals.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Adjusted EPS improved from $0.08 in Q3 to $0.17 in Q4. Revenue grew from $206.8 million in Q3 to $254.3 million in Q4.
* Backlog visibility increased from 46% of 2024 revenue at the start of the year to 49% of 2025 revenue.
* Management tone in Q4 was more positive, reflecting confidence in achieving 2025 targets, compared to a more cautious tone in Q3 due to backlog challenges and external headwinds.
* While nuclear power remained a strategic focus, Q4 featured greater emphasis on medical opportunities, including radiopharmaceutical growth and the Siemens partnership.

### Risks and Concerns

* Potential geopolitical disruptions, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, could impact nuclear and medical opportunities in affected regions.
* Management identified macroeconomic uncertainties such as yield curve dynamics, foreign exchange headwinds, and tariff exposure as potential challenges.
* Dependence on large nuclear orders introduces variability in revenue recognition and backlog replenishment.

### Final Takeaway

Strategic partnerships and a strong backlog position the company for continued growth in 2025, with adjusted EPS targeted between $0.45 and $0.50 and EBITDA margin expansion through operational improvements.
