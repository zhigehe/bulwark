Back in July of last year, one stock that I unfortunately had to downgrade from a ‘buy’ to a ‘hold’ was shoe company **Steven Madden** (NASDAQ:[SHOO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOO "Steven Madden, Ltd.")). From the time I had [initially rated it](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4542456-steven-madden-good-fit-value-portfolio "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4542456-steven-madden-good-fit-value-portfolio") a ‘buy’ in September 2022
