Wall Street on Friday received the January jobs report. Employment growth came in softer than expected in the first month of 2025, even as the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked lower.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total nonfarm payrolls [increased](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405109-nonfarm-payrolls-climbs-less-than-expected-in-january-unemployment-unexpectedly-dips "increased") by 143K in January, much lower than the consensus of +168K. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.0%, coming in lower than the expected figure of 4.1%. 

U.S. stocks ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) opened slightly higher after the jobs report, but then [reversed course](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405171-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market "reversed course") after a reading on consumer inflation expectations and a report that President Donald Trump was planning reciprocal tariffs. Here are some exchange-traded funds that track the benchmark index: ([SPY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY "SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust")), ([VOO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO "Vanguard S&P 500 ETF")), ([IVV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV "iShares Core S&P 500 ETF")), ([RSP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP "Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF")), ([SSO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSO "ProShares Trust - ProShares Ultra S&P500")), ([UPRO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO "ProShares Trust - ProShares UltraPro S&P500")), ([SH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH "ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF")), ([SDS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDS "ProShares UltraShort S&P 500 ETF")), and ([SPXU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPXU "ProShares UltraPro Short S&P 500 ETF")).

See below for various reactions to the jobs report:

[**Chris Lau**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/chris-lau)**, investing group leader of DIY Value Investing**:

"The job trends are expected. Increases in jobs in health care and hospitals offset losses in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. Retail trade also continued its job growth for a second month, while jobs continued to fall in motor vehicles and parts.

Investors should continue to be wary of holding companies that produce economically sensitive items. Tariff threats will hurt the auto sector. Yesterday, Ford Motor ([F](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F "Ford Motor Company")) posted an adjusted free cash flow that missed analyst estimates. Jobs may weaken for the luxury and cosmetics market, too. They are not suitable investments. For example, e.l.f. Beauty ([ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")) will open down by nearly 25% as consumers spend less on cosmetics.

The job revisions also demonstrate the report’s volatility. Although the BLS raised month-over-month jobs higher by 100,000 in Nov. and Dec., the net monthly job change in 2024 was -236,000."

[**Victor Dergunov**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/victor-dergunov "Victor Dergunov")**, investing group leader of The Financial Prophet**:

"It looks we got a Goldilocks jobs print. Not too hot and not too cool. It shows that the labor market remains resilient while potentially increasing the probability for future rate cuts due to some softness. The market can work with this. I expect a positive reaction."

**David Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates**:

"Nobody seems to know or care that the level of payrolls is now 610k lower as of December than was the case before the revisions. Seriously, how can anyone really come to a conclusion that we have a solid jobs market on our hands? Let alone how anyone can even trust the BLS data to begin with."

**Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz**:

"The latest U.S. jobs report presents a fascinating case for analysis. In January, the economy added 143,000 jobs, which fell short of consensus forecasts. However, this shortfall was mitigated by significant upward revisions to employment figures for the two previous months, totaling 100,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate dipped to 4.0%, despite an increase in labor force participation. Meanwhile, monthly wage growth rose to 0.5%. All this is to say that the U.S. labor market remained robust in January."

**Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics**:

"The story in today's payroll numbers is the recent upward inflection in growth, rather than downward revisions to growth several months ago or the somewhat subpar January print. As a result, we are pushing back our forecast for the next Fed policy easing to June, from March."

**Jason Furman, former deputy director of the U.S. National Economic Council**:

"Overall this is why the Fed has stopped cutting rates. The labor market is stable at exactly where they want it to be. Nominal stuff - wages and prices - are growing faster than one would expect in steady state. So the economy certainly doesn't need more demand."

**Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo**:

"On balance, today's employment data, which included annual revisions, should give the FOMC confidence that it can maintain the federal funds rate at its current level for the foreseeable future. A small swoon in the labor market occurred throughout the first half of 2024 as nonfarm payroll growth slowed sharply and the unemployment rate ground modestly higher. But, the more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing.

This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate."
