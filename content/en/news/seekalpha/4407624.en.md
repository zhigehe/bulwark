Earnings Call Insights: Unilever (NYSE:[UL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL "Unilever PLC")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Hein Schumacher, CEO, highlighted the successful execution of the Growth Action Plan ([GAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAP "The Gap, Inc.")) introduced in late 2023, which focuses on operational improvements, brand superiority, and a leaner organizational structure. He noted a 280-basis-point increase in gross margin to 45%, exceeding pre-COVID levels in all business groups except Ice Cream. This expansion supported increased brand investment by €900M, representing 15.5% of turnover.
* Schumacher announced the planned separation of the Ice Cream business by the end of 2025 through a demerger, with listings in Amsterdam, London, and New York. Jean-Francois van Boxmeer was confirmed as Chair Designate for the new entity.
* CFO Fernando Fernandez reported €60.8B in full-year turnover, driven by 4.2% underlying sales growth with a 2.9% increase in volume. The 30 Power Brands contributed 5.3% growth, supported by innovations and premiumization efforts.
* Fernandez highlighted that Beauty & Wellbeing delivered 6.5% sales growth, with strong performances from Dove Hair and Vaseline. Personal Care achieved 5.2% growth, led by deodorants and launches like Dove’s Whole Body Deodorants. Home Care saw 2.9% growth, supported by innovations such as Persil’s Wonder Wash. Foods grew 2.6%, underpinned by Knorr and Hellmann’s, while Ice Cream improved with 3.7% growth driven by innovation and operational enhancements.

### Outlook

* Management projects underlying sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2025, supported by balanced contributions from volume and pricing.
* A modest improvement in the underlying operating margin is anticipated for the full year, with more significant gains expected in the second half.
* Fernando Fernandez noted expectations for €0.8B in commodity inflation, primarily affecting palm oil, surfactants, and cocoa. Pricing adjustments are expected from Q2 2025 onwards to offset these increases.

### Financial Results

* Full-year gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 45%, supported by procurement interventions and capital expenditure focused on margin improvements. Underlying operating profit grew 12.6% to €11.2B, with a 170-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 18.4%.
* Underlying earnings per share increased 14.7% to €2.98. Free cash flow reached €6.9B with a cash conversion rate of 106%.
* Developed markets grew 4.4%, driven by strong performances in North America and Europe, while emerging markets experienced slower growth of 3.1%, impacted by challenges in China and Indonesia.

### Q&A

* Warren Ackerman, Barclays, asked about category growth and margin phasing. Hein Schumacher explained that Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care categories maintained mid-single-digit growth, while Home Care and Ice Cream face headwinds from rising commodity costs. Schumacher confirmed the new gross margin baseline of 45%.
* Celine Pannuti, JPMorgan, inquired about volume visibility amid price elasticity. Schumacher noted innovations like Dove’s new platforms and strong market shares in Europe and North America as drivers of confidence.
* Jeffrey Stent, BNP, asked about post-demerger growth expectations. Schumacher reiterated the goal of 4% to 6% growth for the remaining business post-Ice Cream separation.
* Olivier Nicolai, Goldman Sachs, sought details on commodity inflation. Fernando Fernandez attributed 55% of inflation to palm oil and surfactants and 25% to cocoa, with Ice Cream facing the highest impact.

* Strategic focus expanded with the announced Ice Cream demerger, while regional challenges in China and Indonesia persisted.
* Analysts’ tone remained cautious regarding emerging market performance but recognized improved volume trends in developed markets.
* Management confidence in gross margin improvements and investment in top brands strengthened compared to Q3.

### Risks and Concerns
