Earnings Call Insights: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[ARWR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARWR "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Chris Anzalone announced the closure of a significant licensing and collaboration agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics, which will provide $1.375 billion in upfront and near-term cash payments. This includes a $500 million upfront payment expected within ten days, $325 million from Sarepta’s equity purchase, and $250 million in annual installments over five years. The total deal value, including milestones and royalties, exceeds $11 billion and is intended to fund Arrowhead into 2028.
* The company highlighted three primary growth drivers: plozasiran, obesity programs, and the emerging CNS pipeline. Plozasiran’s first commercial launch is anticipated by late 2025, pending FDA approval. The drug is positioned as a potential major player in the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG).
* CFO Ken Myszkowski emphasized the company’s strengthened financial position with a pro forma cash and investments balance of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, following Sarepta payments. He stated, "We expect our cash and investments balance to be approximately $1 billion at the end of calendar 2025 and runway into 2028."

### Outlook

* Arrowhead plans to launch plozasiran for FCS patients by late 2025, pending FDA review and approval. The FDA has assigned a PDUFA action date of November 18, 2025.
* The company projects plozasiran to generate $2 billion to $3 billion annually in the SHTG market alone, with Phase III studies (SHASTA-3, SHASTA-4, and MUIR 3) expected to complete enrollment this year and study completion in 2026.
* Arrowhead aims to advance CTAs for ARO HTT and ARO MAPT by the end of 2025, targeting Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, respectively.

### Financial Results

* Arrowhead reported Q1 2025 revenue of $2.5 million, primarily from collaboration agreements, compared to $3.6 million in Q1 2024. Net loss for the quarter was $173.1 million or $1.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $132.9 million or $1.24 per share in the prior year.
* Operating expenses increased to $163.9 million, driven by higher R&D costs associated with late-stage clinical trials.
* The company highlighted upcoming revenue recognition from the Sarepta agreement starting Q2 2025.

### Q&A

* **Luca Issi, RBC Capital**: Asked whether obesity programs like ARO-INHBE and ARO-ALK7 are intended as monotherapies or combination therapies. Chief Discovery & Translational Medicine James Hamilton noted the studies are designed to evaluate both scenarios and emphasized the programs' potential to address gaps in metabolic treatments.
* **David Lebowitz, Citi**: Queried physician feedback on APOC3 therapies. SVP Andy Davis stated that despite existing treatment options, enthusiasm remains high for plozasiran due to its deep and durable triglyceride reductions.
* **Jasmine Fels, UBS**: Asked about data expectations for obesity programs. Dr. Hamilton confirmed that body composition data from full-body MRIs and weight loss metrics will be available from the Phase I/IIa trials later in 2025.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed strong interest in plozasiran's growth potential, focusing on its differentiation from competitive therapies and its future in broader SHTG and mixed hyperlipidemia markets. The tone was slightly positive, with analysts pressing for details on timelines and commercial strategies.
* Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks but was cautious in Q&A about committing to timelines for new partnerships or major trial expansions. CEO Chris Anzalone stated, "We are eager to see where our CNS and obesity platforms take us, but we are focused on maintaining financial discipline."

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* The current quarter saw Arrowhead emphasizing its strengthened financial position through the Sarepta deal, a notable shift from the prior quarter’s focus on advancing its cardiometabolic pipeline. Both quarters highlighted plozasiran as a key growth driver.
* Management’s tone remained confident but more focused on financial sustainability this quarter. Analysts’ questions shifted from pipeline breadth to specific commercialization steps and competition.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised questions about the scalability of the plozasiran launch, given the challenges of identifying undiagnosed FCS patients.
* Management acknowledged the need for additional capital to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) for plozasiran and noted ongoing discussions for potential partnerships to support non-core assets.
* CFO Ken Myszkowski highlighted the company’s exposure to increasing R&D costs and the importance of managing expenses.

### Final Takeaway

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals emphasized its strengthened financial position, driven by the Sarepta Therapeutics collaboration. Key growth drivers include plozasiran, which is projected to generate $2 billion to $3 billion annually in the SHTG market, and promising obesity and CNS programs. While the company is funded into 2028, it remains cautious about initiating high-cost trials without additional capital. Investors should monitor the progress of plozasiran’s regulatory approval and the development of obesity and CNS assets for potential near-term catalysts.
