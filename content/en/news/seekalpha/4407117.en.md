MGM Resorts International (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) shot higher in postmarket trading on Wednesday after reporting Q4 results.

The casino operator's consolidated revenue was down 1% year-over-year to $4.3 billion vs $4.2B consensus.

MGM China saw revenue rise 4% to $983 million, due primarily to an increase in casino revenues from favorable hold compared to the prior year. Segment adjusted EBITDAR fell 3% to $255 million. Main floor table games win improved to 25.6% from 23.3% a year ago.

The Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment saw revenue fall 6% to $2.2 billion due primarily to a decrease in casino and room revenues against a comparison of strong results from Formula 1 in the prior year. Segment adjusted EBITDAR fell 11% to $765 million. Casino revenue was down 15%, as table games dragged on results.

The Regional Operations segment saw revenue growth of 7% to $873 million, due primarily to an increase in casino revenue, partially attributable to the effects of the union strike at MGM Grand Detroit in the prior year. Segment adjusted EBITDAR was up 21% to $281 million. Slot win was up 8%.

The MGM Digital segment saw revenue increase 15% to $122 million, and the segment's adjusted EBITDAR loss was $22 million.

Looking ahead, CEO Bill Hornbuckle said the company was encouraged by the strong demand for the business so far in 2025, which is seen positioning it well for continued growth. December was MGM's highest convention booking month on record, and in January, it saw revenue growth in the Las Vegas Strip resorts business and regional operations. Future bookings were also noted to be strong.

Hornbuckle also said the digital businesses is on a positive trajectory, with the BetMGM venture in North America expected to be profitable this year and the global MGM Digital business integrating and scaling to address its significant $41 billion market opportunity.

Shares of MGM Resorts International (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) were up 9.1% in postmarket trading to $37.50.
