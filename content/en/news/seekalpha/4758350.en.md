Investment overview
-------------------

I wrote about OneStream (NASDAQ:[OS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OS "OneStream, Inc.")) previously in [January](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4747630-onestream-long-term-growth-runway-ahead "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4747630-onestream-long-term-growth-runway-ahead") with a buy rating, as I see the potential for this business to continue growing at a rapid pace, which justifies a valuation premium vs. peers. Putting aside how the share price has reacted, I believe 4Q24 earnings were solid. While ARR growth slowed to 23% y/y, FX headwinds and deal delays were key factors. FX impacted ARR by 200 bps, and large public-sector and multinational deals slipped into 1Q25. Adjusting for these, ARR growth would have been much better. Despite my downward revision for growth and attaching a lower multiple, I think the upside remains attractive.

4Q24 earnings were solid, in my opinion
---------------------------------------

I understand the market is worried about slowing annual recurring revenue [ARR] growth and deal delays—[4Q24 ARR](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999005-onestream-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1 "https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999005-onestream-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1") growth slowed to 23% y/y—and this perhaps is the reason for the sharp drop in share price. However, I think more attention should be put on the details that resulted in this slowdown. It was noted that FX drove a 200bps headwind to ARR growth, and deal scrutiny, particularly among large multinational corporations and the public sector, has led to some contracts slipping into early 1Q25. Adjusting for these headwinds, ARR growth should be well in the >25% range. This is not the *best* result, but it's not the worst either if we combine it with other positive operating metrics.

Take, for instance, OS grew 4Q24 revenue by 29.1% y/y to $132.5 million, which is a *very strong growth rate* (~840bps acceleration from ~21% y/y growth in 3Q24). Total subscription revenue also grew 35% y/y with an accelerating shift toward SaaS, with SaaS ARR up 39% y/y despite a slower ARR growth, which reflects strong demand for OS solutions. Customer retention also remained strong at a 98% gross retention rate. Apparently, there were no signs of demand weakness. At the margin level, OS gross margin also remains stable at 69.8%, suggesting that OS is now sacrificing profitability to capture growth. Notably, adj EBIT comes in very strong at ~$8.7 million, a substantial improvement from $1.4 million in 4Q23, which indicates that OS is experiencing strong operating leverage, and margin should continue to expand as OS grows revenue.

As for the concern that investors have regarding the slip in large deals, note that the deals were slipped and not lost. Hence, this is a timing issue. Management acknowledged that certain federal agency contracts and multinational enterprise deals were delayed into 1Q25, largely due to regulatory uncertainties and elongated purchasing cycles. Given that there is a change in administration (the Trump administration operates with very different goals vs. the Biden administration), I think it's fair that such delays happen. The important thing here is that the vast majority of these deals have now closed, which means 1Q25 will benefit from these deals that are pushed back.

> This caused additional deal scrutiny and pushed some deals into the new year, the vast majority of which have closed, including a significant public sector deal. [Company 4Q24 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757208-onestream-inc-2024-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757208-onestream-inc-2024-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation")

AI and Finance Transformation as Long-Term Growth Catalysts
-----------------------------------------------------------

I believe the market’s focus on FX headwinds and deal slippage has caused many participants to be myopic about the traction that OS has seen in its AI solutions. In 4Q24, Finance AI bookings quadrupled y/y, with growing adoption of OS Sensible Machine Learning (SensibleML) technology. This substantial growth shows that there is latent underlying demand, and I don’t see a reason for this adoption trend to slow down, as the value proposition is *incredible.* Per the earnings call, SensibleML managed to improve forecast accuracy by >20% while cutting forecasting cycles by >80%. This is a massive leap in productivity that, I believe, is a huge selling point for CFOs managing complex financial environments.

From a financial standpoint, AI adoption directly impacts growth. As more customers deploy Finance AI, this would drive higher SaaS ARR growth. This was evident in 4Q24, where SaaS ARR grew 39% y/y—well above the total ARR growth rate of 23% y/y—indicating a steady migration toward cloud-based deployments. This shift also helps counter concerns around billings growth deceleration. I get that investors often look at billings growth as a leading indicator of future revenue, but in my view, it shouldn’t be viewed in a vacuum. A shift from one-off billings to a ratable recognition model like SaaS would impact billings booked (making the y/y comparison not like-for-like). I believe a mix shift toward recurring SaaS revenue is overall a good thing, as it provides better visibility and also higher customer lifetime value [CLTV], which is positive for future growth (subscription revenue did grow 35% y/y in 4Q24).

Subscription Growth and Pricing Strategies Driving Upside
---------------------------------------------------------

The other growth lever that, I believe, was missed out on by the market is OS's updated pricing and packaging strategy. Management has talked about this pricing thing previously, but no clear timeline was laid out (no timeline was mentioned in the 3Q24 earnings call as well); hence, I thought it would be in 2026 or beyond. As such, it was a pleasant surprise that 2025 will be the year of this new pricing.

Although management’s FY25 revenue guidance implies ~20% y/y growth, a slowdown from 30% in FY24, I think this slowdown is a near-term one as OS transitions from licenses-led growth to subscription-led growth. I reiterate that subscription revenue grew 35% y/y in 4Q24 and SaaS ARR grew 39% y/y, clearly showing that OS is able to monetize its platform via a SaaS model effectively. As customers transition from traditional licenses to SaaS, it also allows OS to better cross-sell its solutions (like the SensibleML), which drives up revenue per client.

May Investing Ideas



I concede that my growth assumptions may have been too aggressive previously. In this update, I revised my growth assumptions downwards to reflect the impact from OS transitioning into a SaaS-led growth model, with FY25 growth revised to 20% (same as guidance), followed by moderate acceleration as OS sees a higher attach rate of its AI solution and also more cross-sell opportunities. Given this lowered growth profile, I agree that OS should trade at a lower revenue multiple. Comparing OS to bigger players like SAP ([SAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAP "SAP SE")) at 8.9x, Oracle ([ORCL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL "Oracle Corporation")) at 8.9x, Salesforce ([CRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM "Salesforce, Inc.")) at 7.5x, and Workday ([WDAY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDAY "Workday, Inc.")) at 6.8x, OS still has a better growth profile (peers growth ranges from low teens to high teens); as such, I think it should trade at the higher end of where peers trade.

Risk
----

The biggest near-term risk is growth deceleration. While I have addressed my view that ARR growth slowdown is not due to structural reasons, if it continues to decelerate, it will be a major red flag. Macroeconomic uncertainty could also cause further delays, especially among large multinational and public-sector clients.

Conclusion
----------

I give OS a buy rating, as I remain optimistic about the OS growth potential. Despite ARR growth deceleration, OS continues gaining traction in AI-driven finance solutions, SaaS migration, and cross-sell opportunities. Although growth is expected to slow in FY25, I expect acceleration beyond FY25. Hence, I see the current weakness as a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
