The global aluminum market is poised for a [new period of upheaval](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/02/11/trump-tariffs-spell-fresh-turmoil-for-volatile-aluminum-market/ "new period of upheaval") after President Trump [ordered 25% tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405874-trump-signs-order-imposing-25-percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum "ordered 25% tariffs") on all imports of aluminum and steel on Monday, a move analysts say likely will increase costs for U.S. buyers and force at least some rerouting of international trade flows.

"We expect any tariff would lead to higher prices for U.S. manufacturers‚Äù due to higher regional premiums, ANZ Group analysts said, adding that more Canadian supply likely will be exported to Europe while the U.S. increases its purchases from the Middle East.

"U.S. aluminum buyers will have to share more of the cost increase as its demand is resilient, not replaceable," according to AZ China analyst Zhang Meng, noting that the U.S. has a very limited number of new aluminum projects.

There is speculation that some nations could again be excluded, and Trump said he will [give "great consideration" to Australia](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-consider-exemption-australia-steel-tariffs-pm-says-2025-02-10/ "give \"great consideration\" to Australia") following a phone conversation with Prime Minister Albanese, noting Australia was one of the few countries with which the U.S. had a trade surplus.

"Assuming no significant exemptions, we expect the aluminum and steel tariffs to be largely passed through to U.S. prices," Goldman Sachs analysts said, adding that the policy affects the cost of importing aluminum into the U.S. but has no direct impact on the London Metal Exchange prices.

Indeed, the price reaction on the LME to Trump's move is muted, as LME aluminum prices ([LMAHDS03:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMAHDS03:COM "Aluminum Futures")) recently traded -0.6% at $2,642.50/ton; all metals were lower, with copper and nickel down ~1%.

On Monday, Century Aluminum ([CENX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CENX "Century Aluminum Company")) finished +10.2%, while Kaiser Aluminum ([KALU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KALU "Kaiser Aluminum Corporation")) +2.4% and Alcoa (NYSE:[AA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AA "Alcoa Corporation")) +2.2%.
