With many biotechs and pharmas needing to fill impending revenue holes coming later in the decade, M&A is posed to pick up, but not until government and regulatory uncertainty settles down.

Dealmaking experts taking part in a panel discussion at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference in NYC on Tuesday said that M&A activity has been slow-going so far in 2024 as companies deal with uncertainties that come with a new administration.

Evan Matlin, a partner with MTS Health Partners, said that he sees M&A activity picking up later in the year.

The FTC has not been kind in recent years in approving deals, but that should change with Andrew Ferguson now as chairman, according to Arda Ural, Americas life science section leader with EY-Parthenon. He expects dealmaking to accelerate starting in the summer.

Companies are on the hunt for new chemical entities that have large addressable markets with high unmet need, Andrew Lam, managing director, head of biotech private equity at Ally Bridge Group. He sees particularly high interest in companies with obesity and antibody-drug conjugate assets.

Matlin noted that many companies are "almost religious" about only doing deals with a minimum value of $1B, with some only after $2B+ transactions.

Looking back, Lam said that 2024 was not a good year for IPOs in the biotech space as 15 of the 17 are currently below their IPO price, even as 16 of them were for companies with assets in the clinic.
