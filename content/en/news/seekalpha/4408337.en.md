Earnings Call Insights: AVITA Medical (NASDAQ:[RCEL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCEL "AVITA Medical, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Jim Corbett highlighted the company's transformation into a multiproduct therapeutic acute wound care leader. The product portfolio now includes RECELL, RECELL GO, RECELL GO Mini, PermeaDerm, and Cohealyx. This expansion has increased the total addressable market (TAM) from $500M to $3.5B in the U.S., spanning burns and trauma centers.
* RECELL GO has achieved broad adoption, with nearly all burn accounts and over 70% of trauma center accounts converted, representing 83% of total unit volume. RECELL GO Mini, approved in December, is set for Q1 rollout to address smaller wounds in burn and trauma centers.
* CFO David O'Toole reported Q4 commercial revenue at $18.4M, a 30% year-over-year increase. Gross profit margin improved to 87.6%, while operating expenses decreased to $26.1M, aligning with expectations for consistent levels in 2025.
* O'Toole confirmed plans to maintain operating expenses at Q4 levels for 2025, emphasizing that new product launches will drive revenue without expanding the commercial organization.

### Outlook

* Management projects 2025 commercial revenue between $100M and $106M, representing 55% to 65% growth over 2024. The company expects to achieve free cash flow in the second half of 2025 and GAAP profitability in Q4 2025.
* CEO Corbett detailed the April 1, 2025, commercial launch of Cohealyx, supported by a consignment model with RFID tracking to facilitate hospital adoption. Cohealyx adds nearly $1B in TAM within burn centers and $1.35B in trauma centers.
* RECELL GO Mini's rollout targets trauma centers and smaller wounds, expanding the trauma center market by approximately 270,000 full-thickness acute wounds annually.

### Financial Results

* Q4 commercial revenue was $18.4M compared to analysts' estimate of $19.8M. Gross margin improved to 87.6% from 87.3% in Q4 2023. Operating expenses decreased to $26.1M from $30.2M in Q3 2024, reflecting reduced nonrecurring costs.
* The company reported a Q4 net loss of $11.6M, or (-$0.44) per share, compared to (-$0.28) per share in Q4 2023. Cash and marketable securities stood at $35.9M as of year-end.

### Q&A

* Matthew Park, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about sequential growth expectations for 2025. CEO Corbett explained that multiproduct rollouts, including RECELL GO Mini and Cohealyx, position the company for consecutive quarter-over-quarter revenue increases, with a stronger back half due to Cohealyx.
* Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG: Questioned the impact of deferred purchases in Q4. CFO O'Toole clarified that these were timing-related and not due to demand issues, with normal purchasing activity resuming in January.
* Joshua Jennings, TD Cowen: Inquired about Cohealyx adoption drivers. Corbett highlighted the significant reduction in hospital stays and costs associated with Cohealyx, citing a case where a patient's hospital stay was reduced from an expected 30 days to 10 days.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism, focusing on the adoption pace of new products and the impact of deferred Q4 purchases. Questions about Cohealyx centered on clinical evidence and market share potential.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding the company's multiproduct strategy and operational efficiencies. Corbett's emphasis on transformative growth and financial discipline reflected positive sentiment.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone remained consistent, though analysts appeared more focused on execution and near-term revenue contributions from new products.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 saw a reduction in operating expenses from Q3's $30.2M to $26.1M, aligning with prior guidance. Gross margin improved from 83.7% in Q3 to 87.6% in Q4, recovering from temporary declines.
* Product updates included the Q4 approval of RECELL GO Mini and its upcoming rollout, compared to Q3's focus on RECELL GO adoption. Cohealyx moved from preapproval discussions to a planned commercial launch in April 2025.
* Analysts maintained concerns about VAC delays and the timing of product launches but shifted focus to Cohealyx's revenue potential and operational execution.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management identified potential delays in hospital VAC approvals as a challenge but emphasized mitigation efforts through data-supported rollouts and consignment models.
* Analysts raised concerns about gross margin dilution from Cohealyx and PermeaDerm, though CFO O'Toole assured that their contributions would enhance operating margins.

### Final Takeaway

AVITA Medical's Q4 2024 call highlighted its evolution into a multiproduct company with a $3.5B TAM. Key drivers include the April 2025 launch of Cohealyx, RECELL GO Mini's rollout, and operational efficiencies. With a focus on achieving profitability by Q4 2025, the company is positioned for significant growth in burns and trauma markets.
