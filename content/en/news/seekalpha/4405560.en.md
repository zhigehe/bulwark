Shares of Motorcar Parts of America (NASDAQ:[MPAA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPAA "Motorcar Parts of America, Inc.")) raced higher in early Monday trading with a double-digit gain as the company swung to a profit in the [fiscal third quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405531-motorcar-parts-of-america-gaap-eps-of-0_11-beats-by-0_34-revenue-of-186_2m-beats-by-6_7m "fiscal third quarter") thanks to record net sales.

Demand for aftermarket auto parts drove FQ3 sales up 8.3% to a record $186.2M beating Wall Street’s expectations by $6.7M, helping the company swing to a profit of $0.11 per share from a loss of $2.40 per share a year ago, $0.34 above expectations.  This elevated MPAA’s gross profit margin by 660 basis point to 24.1%.

“We achieved solid results for the quarter and continue to benefit from strategic initiatives designed to enhance our performance,” said CEO Selwyn Joffe, adding that the underlying fundamentals of the business remain strong.

Increased sales enabled the company to generate ~$34.4M of cash and reduce its net debt by $30.3M to $84M.

Shares are rallying by 26% and in the green for a second day after a string of losses last week.
