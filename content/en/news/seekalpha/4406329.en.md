The U.S. FDA [rejection](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4138378-psychedlic-drug-developers-setback-ecstasy-based-drug-rejected-fda "rejection") of an MDMA-based drug from Lykos Therapeutics for PTSD in August 2024 has not dimmed hopes that other psychedelic-oriented therapies can gain approval, according to the CEO of Atai Life Sciences (NASDAQ:[ATAI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATAI "Atai Life Sciences N.V.")).

Srinivas Rao, who is also Atai's co-founder, said that the application for the candidate, midomafetamine, had issues, including a small dataset and functional unblinding involving investigators.

Speaking at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference in New York City, he added that these concerns were "highly specific to the company."

Rao cited Johnson & Johnson's Spravato (esketamine), a hallucinogen drug closely related to ketamine, as an example of a therapy the FDA has approved that has mood-altering properties. Esketamine received Breakthrough Therapy designation as well as an FDA advisory committee meeting.

Atai's lead candidate, in phase 2, is the DMT-based compound VLS-01 for treatment-resistant depression.
