Investment Thesis
-----------------

Dutch Bros (NYSE:[BROS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS "Dutch Bros Inc.")) delivers very strong guidance with its [Q4 2024 results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407250-dutch-bros-non-gaap-eps-of-0_07-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-342_79m-beats-by-24_01m), which I believe the market will reward and propel its share price higher.

Therefore, I'm somewhat bullish on this stock. Why only somewhat bullish? Because beyond the headline story of this surprisingly strong revenue guidance, I highlight a lot of blemishes here.

In sum, I'm tentative bullish on BROS. It may work out positively, but there are a lot of caveats to think about too.

Rapid Recap
-----------

It's been a very long time since I [covered](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651648-dutch-bros-financial-prudence-or-growth-ambitions-at-a-crossroads) BROS.

More than 12 months back. During that time, the stock was flat as a pancake, even though recently, the stock has started to gain traction.

Needless to point out the obvious that in the past 12 months, the whole market has been on fire and aggressively moving higher. And being neutral on BROS would have been the right call.

Dutch Bros' Near-Term Prospects
-------------------------------

Dutch Bros is a coffee chain that is all about its customizable drinks, especially iced coffees and energy drinks.

Customers love it not just for the drinks but for the vibe too.

And it appears that this isn't just some PR spin, since customers are very much recurring patrons and its rewards program has been a hit.

Looking ahead, Dutch Bros is in major growth mode. They opened 151 new shops in 2024 and are aiming to expand more than 160 shops in 2025.

For their part, they contend that they are being smart about where they open and investing in marketing to make sure new locations take off quickly.

As an investor, *I struggle to not bring up* the common sense fact that there's already a ton of competition in the hot beverage space. Not only Starbucks ([SBUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX "Starbucks Corporation")), of course, but lots of small regional players too.

I recognize that now they are seeking to broaden their offering to food options too, but is that truly going to deliver the sort of stable revenue growth this story needs? I'm not sure.

26% Y/Y Revenue Growth Rates Guided Ahead
-----------------------------------------

This is the bull case at its core. This is a growth story.

A story of consistent growth. Now, I don't want to get into my bearish concerns too quickly, but naturally, I do think I owe it to the reader to add just this one nugget.

The growth rates are strong because of the pace at which they are opening up stores. They already have about 1,000 stores. And they plan on opening up at least a further 160 stores, with the final figure probably reaching 170 stores.

This means that more than half of its 26% y/y revenue growth in 2025 is coming from shops opening. Think about that. Doesn't it reach a point where there's some level of cannibalization?

On the other hand, Starbucks has more than 18,000 stores in the US alone ([page 5](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm)).

With that in mind, let's now discuss its valuation.

BROS Stock Valuation -- 155x Forward Free Cash Flow
---------------------------------------------------

Dutch Bros has a net cash position of approximately $56 million, *if you don't include* either its finance lease liabilities or its operating lease liabilities.

Now, if investors start to sour up on BROS, and start to question its balance sheet, then, in my opinion, this balance sheet is problematic.

And this is the reason why. For 2024, BROS' free cash flow stood at $34 million, a tremendous turnaround from the negative $87 million reported in 2023. In other words, the free cash flow has been ramped up, as BROS' makes more free cash flow in Q4 than it did the whole of the first 9 months of 2024.

Now, what's interesting here is that BROS' EBITDA margin stood at 18% in 2024. Meanwhile, its guidance for 2025 points to around a similar figure of 18%.

This means that investors are willing to give BROS the benefit of the doubt that at some point in the future, the bulk of its 2025 $280 million EBITDA could turn into free cash flow.

For my part, I'm skeptical. For one, BROS is deploying about $250 million of its EBITDA back as capex. So, how much of its EBITDA actually ends up as free cash flow? Probably $80 million. And that's in the best-case scenario.

This means that the stock is priced at roughly 155x forward free cash flow, thereby pricing me out.

Further Risk Factors
--------------------

I suspect that the market is looking at BROS as a turnaround business that is now finally hitting its stride.

If that's the case, my concerns about its future free cash flows are unfounded and the stock could easily continue to move higher.

After all, I've seen other cases too, businesses such as CAVA ([CAVA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAVA "CAVA Group, Inc.")), where the valuation made absolutely no sense to me continue to move higher and higher. Therefore, one could easily make the argument that the business is now gaining a bigger institutional following, and as such, the stock will less volatile and could end up trading at an even higher premium.

On the other hand, I can't see how paying more than 100x forward free cash flow for a notoriously cyclical sector makes any sense. But I've been wrong more times than I can count, so I leave room for doubt.

Data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com)



In the past twelve months, BROS' diluted share count is up 53% y/y, while its revenues are up 43% y/y. Personally, I have no issue with heavy dilution. But I do ask that the revenue line grows faster than the share count.

The Bottom Line
---------------

Dutch Bros is delivering strong growth and guidance, which the market is likely to reward. With 26% Y/Y revenue growth projected and aggressive store expansion, this is a clear growth story!

However, my bullish thesis comes with many reservations. The companyâ€™s high valuation, as well as the reliance on store openings for growth, gives me pause.

If the market continues to see BROS as a turnaround story, the stock could keep climbing, but I'm only tepidly bullish here.
