Let's say you're approaching retirement and thinking about how to invest your nest egg to generate roughly equal monthly income.

Or maybe you just sold a rental property and are thinking about how to replace the lost monthly cash flow.

Or perhaps you are converting a 401k to a Roth IRA and rearranging the investments to maximize monthly income.

Or, perhaps you already have a large invested portfolio but are unsatisfied with how lopsided your dividend income is -- heavy in some months but light in others.

In any case, there are many reasons why an investor might want to smooth out their dividend income across all twelve months of the year. For those regularly withdrawing cash from their accounts to fund living expenses, monthly regularity in portfolio income aligns income with expenses. For those still in accumulation mode, regularity of income provides the satisfaction of smooth monthly reinvestment and compounding.

Let's say you'd like to generate $1,000 a month in dividend income. Given that real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) ([VNQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ "Vanguard Real Estate ETF")) are designed to be income-generating vehicles and offer a wide range of variety within the sector, one can construct a $1,000-a-month portfolio made up entirely of REITs.

But how much money would it require? And what could such a portfolio look like?

Let's dive in.

How To Build A $1,000-A-Month REIT Portfolio
--------------------------------------------

First, how much invested money is required to generate $1,000 a month in dividends?

The math to determine this is pretty simple. Just divide $12,000 ($1,000 per month for 12 months) by the dividend yield of the portfolio. Here are some examples:

| **Yield** | **Money Required To Generate $1,000/Month** |
| --- | --- |
| 3% | $400,000 |
| 4% | $300,000 |
| 5% | $240,000 |
| 6% | $200,000 |

Obviously, the lower the yield, the greater the amount of invested money required to generate $1,000 a month. The higher the yield, the less money is required to do so.

The great thing about REITs is that there are many solid, well-managed names in this space with moderately high yields.

Below, we highlight a theoretical REIT portfolio that achieves roughly $1,000 a month in dividends. Note that this is just one possible way of creating a $1,000 monthly dividend REIT portfolio. There are other ways to configure it with other REITs.

| **MONTHLY (25%)** | **Dividend Yield** | **Annual Income Based On $233,000 Portfolio** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agree Realty ([ADC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADC "Agree Realty Corporation")) | 4.2% | $815 |
| BSR REIT ([OTCPK:BSRTF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BSRTF "BSR Real Estate Investment Trust")) | 5.0% | $971 |
| Gladstone Land Pref B ([LANDO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LANDO "Gladstone Land Corporation 6.00% CUM REDEEMABLE PFD STK SER B")) | 7.4% | $1,437 |
| **JANUARY-APRIL-JULY-OCTOBER (25%)** |  |  |
| Alexandria Real Estate ([ARE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARE "Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.")) | 5.5% | $641 |
| Safehold ([SAFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAFE "Safehold Inc.")) | 4.4% | $513 |
| W. P. Carey ([WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")) | 6.3% | $734 |
| UDR Inc. ([UDR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UDR "UDR, Inc.")) | 4.1% | $478 |
| VICI Properties ([VICI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VICI "VICI Properties Inc.")) | 5.8% | $676 |
| **FEBRUARY-MAY-AUGUST-NOVEMBER (20%)** |  |  |
| Healthpeak Properties ([DOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOC "Healthpeak Properties, Inc.")) | 5.9% | $1,375 |
| NNN REIT ([NNN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNN "NNN REIT, Inc.")) | 5.9% | $1,375 |
| **MARCH-JUNE-SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER (30%)** |  |  |
| Prologis ([PLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLD "Prologis, Inc.")) | 3.3% | $769 |
| Extra Space Storage ([EXR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXR "Extra Space Storage Inc.")) | 4.2% | $979 |
| Crown Castle ([CCI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCI "Crown Castle Inc.")) | 7.0% (Est. ~5.5% Post-Div Cut) | $1,282 |

(Note that there is some speculation that Crown Castle will cut its dividend if it goes through with selling its fiber segment. If so, we estimate a dividend cut of 20%.)

Here are the dividend yield averages for each category:

* Monthly: 5.5%
* Jan-Apr-Jul-Oct: 5.2%
* Feb-May-Aug-Nov: 5.9%
* Mar-Jun-Sep-Dec: 4.3%.

Why did we go with a total portfolio value of $233,000? Because that's how much would require $1,000 a month in dividends. The weighted average yield of the full portfolio is 5.15%, and $12,000 / 0.0515 = $233,000.

The monthly dividend payers provide a base of about $269 in monthly income.

The January/April/July/October REITs pay $761 per quarter, which combined with monthly payers brings total dividends in those months to $1,030.

The February/May/August/November REITs pay $688 per quarter, which brings total dividends in those months to $957.

And the March/June/September/December REITs pay $758, which brings total dividends in those months to $1,027.

As you can see, the portfolio comes just shy of reaching $1,000 per month in February, May, August, and November while slightly overshooting it in the other months. One could, of course, tinker with weightings to perfectly smooth out the monthly payouts if desired.

### Why This Particular Portfolio of REITs?

We did not pick these particular REITs based purely on their dividend payout schedules. We also picked them to highlight how one can achieve a fair degree of diversification while remaining entirely within the real estate sector.

While paying roughly $1,000 a month, this portfolio also provides material exposure to:

* Apartments via BSR REIT and UDR Inc.
* Single-tenant net lease via Agree Realty, NNN REIT, W.P. Carey, and VICI Properties
* Farmland via LANDO
* Life science/lab space via Alexandria Real Estate
* Outpatient medical buildings via Healthpeak Properties
* Ground leases via Safehold
* Industrial properties via Prologis
* Self-storage via Extra Space Storage
* Wireless communication towers via Crown Castle.

While the stock price performance of these various REITs may or may not be correlated, the fundamentals all vary from sub-sector to sub-sector and even from REIT to REIT. This is a significant and often overlooked consideration.

For example, an investor who sells a rental property and reinvests the proceeds into the above REIT portfolio not only maintains a robust and smooth income stream, but also greatly increases their fundamental diversification.

As Warren Buffett once said, “Diversification is the only free lunch in investing.”

Bottom Line
-----------

For investors looking to create an even distribution of dividend income across all 12 months of the year, REITs are a great way to accomplish that while maximizing income. In fact, we think you could construct a $1,000-a-month portfolio using nothing but REITs.
