* Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:[SWKS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWKS "Skyworks Solutions, Inc.")) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at investment firm Argus on Monday, amid worries about its Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) business following its [latest quarterly results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404389-skyworks-solutions-sinks-as-apple-plans-to-cut-content-demand-for-new-iphone "latest quarterly results").
* Shares rose fractionally in premarket trading.
* "Apple will dual-source a premier RF socket in the new device family that Skyworks formerly sole-sourced," analysts at the firm wrote in a note to clients. "Apple is by far the company's largest customer, at 69% of FY24 revenue. At mid-percentage, Skyworks will lose an estimate $600 million-plus in total annual revenue due to iPhone content loss. Skyworks in spring 2024 announced that it had lost approximately 10% of content in the iPhone 16 family."
* "As a provider of standalone RF solutions, Skyworks is facing increasingly intense competition from companies such as Qualcomm that can provide a bundled RF-modem solution for the age of AI," the analysts added. "Although the shares weakened on earlier loss of iPhone 16 business and sold off sharply on the iPhone 17 news, we are not inclined to upgrade on SWKS on price alone. We would need to see signs that the Mobility business is back on track, and that Broad Markets has returned to strong growth before considering an upgrade."
