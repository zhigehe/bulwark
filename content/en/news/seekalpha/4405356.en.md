Earnings Call Insights: Matthews International Corporation (NASDAQ:[MATW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MATW "Matthews International Corporation")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Joe Bartolacci highlighted a significant arbitration ruling affirming Matthews' rights to market and sell its dry battery electrode ([DBE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBE "Invesco DB Energy ETF")) technology. He noted this ruling as a validation of the company’s intellectual property and history in the battery technology space, enabling the company to resume its marketing initiatives. He stated, "We expect that ramp to be slow at first...but as we expand the portfolio of customers, we can expand pretty quickly."
* Bartolacci announced the sale of SGK Brand Solutions, emphasizing its strategic benefits. The transaction is expected to generate $50 million in synergies within 24 to 30 months and significantly simplify the company’s operating structure. Proceeds will be applied to debt reduction, reducing leverage from 3.9 to below 3.0.
* CFO Steve Nicola reported a net loss of $3.5 million or $0.11 per share, while non-GAAP adjusted net income was $4.3 million or $0.14 per share. He attributed the decline to lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expenses.
* Nicola detailed a 10% year-over-year decline in consolidated sales to $401.8 million, driven by lower engineering sales in Industrial Technologies and a decrease in Memorialization segment sales due to lower casket volumes.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $205 million to $215 million, contingent on the timing of the SGK transaction’s closing.
* Bartolacci mentioned plans to leverage the DBE technology ruling to re-engage with multiple customers, anticipating initial benefits in fiscal 2025. However, he characterized this as a multi-year growth opportunity.
* The SGK transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, with benefits including debt reduction and an improved corporate structure.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2025 was $40 million, down from $45.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to declines in the Industrial Technologies segment. Sales in this segment fell to $80.5 million, reflecting slower Tesla-related projects and litigation impacts on other customer engagements.
* Memorialization segment sales declined to $190.5 million, reflecting lower casket volumes and reduced granite memorial sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment remained steady at $36.6 million, supported by cost savings and improved pricing.
* SGK Brand Solutions reported a modest revenue increase to $130.8 million, driven by pricing improvements and growth in specific markets. Adjusted EBITDA in the segment declined slightly to $12.3 million due to higher labor costs.
* Cash flow utilization for operating activities was $25 million, reflecting litigation costs and upfront expenses related to cost reduction initiatives. Outstanding debt increased to $809 million, but the SGK transaction is expected to substantially reduce this figure.

### Q&A

* Liam Burke, B. Riley, inquired about the timeline for building momentum in DBE technology post-litigation. Bartolacci noted that while the ramp-up would be gradual, "We went from $20 million to $120 million pretty quickly" in previous Tesla engagements, signaling optimism for future growth.
* Daniel Moore, CJS Securities, asked about the industrial technologies decline. Bartolacci attributed the majority of the $30 million year-over-year decline to delays in energy storage projects and litigation impacts. He also forecasted recovery in warehouse automation due to increased quoting activity.
* Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer, questioned Tesla's status as a customer. Bartolacci confirmed Tesla remains a customer with a significant backlog, though future relations depend on Tesla’s decisions.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, with questions focused on recovery timelines for DBE technology and Industrial Technologies. Concerns about litigation impact and delayed growth in these areas persisted.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly about the DBE ruling and SGK transaction benefits. Bartolacci emphasized growth opportunities and long-term shareholder value, repeatedly referencing "significant opportunities" and "value creation."
* Compared to the prior quarter, management displayed greater confidence due to the resolution of key uncertainties, such as the DBE litigation and strategic portfolio adjustments.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance remained consistent at $205 million to $215 million in adjusted EBITDA.
* Strategic focus shifted toward leveraging new opportunities from DBE technology and the SGK transaction. In contrast, the previous quarter emphasized defending intellectual property and navigating litigation challenges.
* Analysts this quarter focused heavily on DBE technology and industrial technologies, while the prior quarter included broader discussions on Memorialization and SGK stabilization.
* Management tone in Q1 2025 was more assertive, reflecting progress in resolving litigation and executing strategic transactions.

### Risks and Concerns

* Litigation with Tesla continues to pose risks, though the arbitration ruling provides clarity. Bartolacci acknowledged potential delays in customer adoption as the company rebuilds momentum.
* The Industrial Technologies segment remains challenged by project delays and market softness in warehouse automation.
* Memorialization faces headwinds from declining casketed deaths, though management highlighted growth opportunities in cremation-related products and mausoleum construction.

### Final Takeaway

Matthews International’s Q1 2025 earnings call highlighted key advancements, including a favorable arbitration ruling on its DBE technology and the strategic sale of SGK Brand Solutions. While financial results reflected declines in sales and adjusted EBITDA, the company maintained its fiscal 2025 guidance, signaling optimism in growth areas like energy storage and Industrial Technologies. Management's focus on debt reduction and portfolio optimization underscores a strategic pivot towards long-term shareholder value creation.
