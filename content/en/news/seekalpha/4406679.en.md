* SiteOne Landscape [press release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999415-siteone-landscape-supply-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-earnings) (NYSE:[SITE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SITE "SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc.")): Q4 GAAP EPS of -$0.48  misses by $0.19.
* Revenue of $1.01B (+4.7% Y/Y)  beats by $11.36M.
* Organic Daily Sales increased 1%.
* Adjusted EBITDA decreased 20% to $31.8 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin was 3.1%.
* Cash provided by operating activities increased $11.8 million to $119.4 million.
* Repurchased $30.0 million of shares under the share repurchase authorization.
* "In terms of end markets, we expect overall demand to be flat to slightly up with modest growth in maintenance and resilient demand in repair and upgrade, new residential, and new commercial construction. With the benefit of our commercial initiatives, we expect sales volume to more than offset price deflation, yielding low single-digit Organic Daily Sales growth for the full year. With the strong actions taken in 2024 to reduce cost combined with our continued operational initiatives, ongoing SG&A management, and contributions from acquisitions, we expect to increase Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2025."
  
  Given these trends, we expect our Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million. Our guidance does not include any contributions from unannounced acquisitions.
