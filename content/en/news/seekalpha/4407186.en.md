Earnings Call Insights: Highwoods Properties (NYSE:[HIW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIW "Highwoods Properties, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ted Klinck highlighted significant growth potential over the next few years, driven by three main factors: lease-up of core properties, stabilization of the development pipeline, and acquisitions. Klinck noted that recently signed leases for four core buildings could generate over $25 million in stabilized annual NOI and two development properties set to deliver in 2025 are projected to add nearly $10 million in annual NOI.
* Management disclosed that its initial 2025 FFO outlook is $3.26 to $3.44 per share, accounting for recent asset sales and equity issuance.
* EVP & CFO Brendan Maiorana stated, "We have no debt maturities until a $200 million floating rate term-loan in 2026 and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 6.1 times."
* EVP & COO Brian Leary emphasized strong leasing momentum, with 4 million square feet of second-generation leases signed during 2024 and noted that the development pipeline is now 59% leased.

### Outlook

* Management projects occupancy to dip to 85% to 86.5% in early 2025, with a recovery expected in the second half of the year, reaching 86% to 87% by year-end.
* Same-property cash NOI growth for 2025 is expected to range from negative 2% to negative 4%, reflecting the impact of move-outs and recent asset sales.
* The development pipeline is expected to contribute $30 million in NOI above the 2025 outlook, supported by active leasing at GlenLake Three and Granite Park Six and the delivery of 23Springs and Midtown East.

### Financial Results

* Fourth-quarter FFO was $0.85 per share, aligned with the companyâ€™s outlook, including a $0.01 non-cash write-off. Full-year FFO reached $3.61 per share, exceeding the original mid-point guidance.
* Net income reported a loss of ($0.03) per share due to a $24.6 million impairment charge related to an office building in Pittsburgh.
* The company raised $215 million through non-core dispositions and equity issuance, creating ample liquidity for future investments.

### Q&A

* Michael Griffin, Citigroup: Asked about leasing expectations for larger vacancies in 2025. CFO Brendan Maiorana responded that the occupancy outlook does not yet reflect leasing for certain under-occupied assets but emphasized strong prospect activity for key properties like Symphony Place in Nashville and Westwood South.
* Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley: Inquired about changes in leasing strategy for 2025. CEO Ted Klinck stated there are no major changes, highlighting the continued success of their spec suite program and positive leasing momentum, including interest from larger users.
* Vikram Malhotra, Mizuho: Asked about potential acquisition opportunities. CEO Klinck noted a focus on both core and opportunistic assets, emphasizing improving portfolio quality, growth rates, and cash flows.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, frequently highlighting leasing momentum and prospects for occupancy recovery. Analyst sentiment leaned slightly positive but reflected skepticism around broader market challenges and leasing costs.
* Management maintained an optimistic tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing growth opportunities and resilience. However, during Q&A, the tone shifted slightly defensive when discussing challenges like occupancy dips and market conditions.
* Compared to the prior quarter, management displayed similar levels of confidence, but analysts appeared marginally more concerned about near-term headwinds in occupancy and NOI.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language shifted slightly, with more emphasis on occupancy recovery and NOI growth potential in late 2025, compared to Q3 where immediate leasing momentum was the focus.
* Leasing activity remained robust, but Q4 highlighted significant progress in development pipeline lease-ups, which was less emphasized in Q3.
* Analysts in Q4 focused more on leasing costs and acquisition opportunities, reflecting a shift in priorities.
* Management's confidence in long-term growth remained consistent, though the focus on mitigating short-term occupancy dips was more pronounced than in Q3.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management flagged the impact of known move-outs in early 2025, affecting both occupancy and NOI.
* Analysts raised concerns about the elevated leasing CapEx required to drive occupancy growth and the potential headwinds from the broader office market environment.
* Asset recycling efforts rely on market conditions, as non-core asset sales may face challenges if the investment sales market remains tight.

### Final Takeaway

Highwoods Properties remains focused on long-term growth through lease-ups of its core portfolio, proactive development pipeline management, and strategic acquisitions. While the company anticipates short-term headwinds in occupancy and NOI due to known move-outs, its strong leasing activity and robust financial position provide a solid foundation for growth in late 2025 and beyond. Investors should monitor occupancy recovery and leasing trends closely as the company navigates near-term challenges and capitalizes on future opportunities.
