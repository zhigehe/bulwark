Hanesbrands (NYSE:[HBI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBI "Hanesbrands Inc.")) shares cratered in Thursday’s trade, dropping to a 6-month low and below its 200-day moving average for the firs time since May as a less-than-expected increase in [Q4 sales](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407590-hanesbrands-reports-mixed-q4-results-initiates-q1-and-fy25-outlook "Q4 sales") coupled with disappointing revenue guidance for Q1 and 2025 soured investor sentiment.

The parent company of Maidenform, Playtex, and Hanes realized an increased adjusted profit, largely a result of supply chain consolidation, increased efficiencies, and lower inventories. Sales were up as well, increasing by 4.5% from the same quarter last year, but missed Wall Street’s [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBI/earnings " expectations ") by $11M. The company also projected Q1 and FY25 sales to be less than expected.

Additionally, on an unadjusted basis, Hanesbrands (NYSE:[HBI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBI "Hanesbrands Inc.")) swung to a loss of $0.04 per share from a profit of $0.22 a year ago.

By segment, U.S. sales increased 3% with a 525-basis point increase in operating margin thanks to cost savings, and lower input costs.

International sales were up 2%, which includes a negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations, with a 550-basis point increase to operating margin.

On the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents improved by 5% to $215.4M, the leverage ratio dropped to 3.4x from 6.4x last year, and inventory was down 9% on improved inventory management, including SKU discipline and lifecycle management.

For FY25, Hanesbrands (NYSE:[HBI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBI "Hanesbrands Inc.")) expects net sales to be between $3.47B and $3.52B which includes ~$60B in FX headwinds, and earnings of $0.51 to $0.55. This compares to [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBI/earnings/estimates " expectations ") for sales of $3.63B and an adjusted profit of $0.52 per share.

Expectations for the current quarter are also below-consensus as sales guidance of $750M is less than $785.3M estimates, while EPS guidance of $0.02 per share is a penny short of expectations.

Shares were also weighed down by the [announcement](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407599-hanesbrands-ceo-steve-bratspies-to-step-down " announcement ") that CEO Steve Bratspies is stepping down at the end of this year, or as soon as a successor is named. Bratspies will also vacate his seat on the Board concurrent with the end of his tenure as CEO, staying on only in an advisory role to ensure a smooth transition with a new CEO.
