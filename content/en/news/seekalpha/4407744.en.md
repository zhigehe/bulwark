UBS has upgraded Roche ([OTCQX:RHHBY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY "Roche Holding AG")) to buy from neutral, citing the company's growth outlook.

"We see sustained outperformance of Vabysmo and Ocrevus as key drivers of near-term growth, with additional benefit from Xolair food allergy and potential upside from Elevidys ex-US," UBS said in a note.

UBS added that while it believes readouts for AstraZeneca's ([AZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN "AstraZeneca PLC")) Enhertu will "gradually pressure the HER2 franchise", it also sees "the strong conversion to Phesgo unpinning a sustainable franchise."

The bank raised its price target to CHF 338 from CHF 300.
