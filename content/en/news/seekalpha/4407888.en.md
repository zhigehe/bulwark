Earnings Call Insights: Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ:[BPMC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPMC "Blueprint Medicines Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Kate Haviland highlighted that Blueprint Medicines achieved $479 million in product revenue for 2024, driven by AYVAKIT’s 135% annual growth. The company expects AYVAKIT to generate $680 million to $710 million in revenue for 2025, representing a 45% growth rate at the midpoint. Management aims to achieve $2 billion in AYVAKIT revenue by 2030.
* Haviland shared that the market for systemic mastocytosis ([SM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SM "SM Energy Company")) is larger than previously estimated, with the number of diagnosed SM patients in the U.S. growing to over 25,000. New epidemiology data suggests a twofold increase in potential SM patients, with an estimated prevalence of 60,000 in the U.S.
* The CEO emphasized strategic investments in education, market-building initiatives, and commercial expansion to drive multidimensional growth. These initiatives include adding to the U.S. commercial field team and expanding the reach to medical dermatologists and gastroenterologists.
* CFO Mike Landsittel reported a 2024 cash position of $864 million and highlighted a significant reduction in operating cash burn, with further decreases expected in 2025. He also noted the anticipated $80 million payment from GSK’s acquisition of IDRx as part of Blueprint’s equity stake.

### Outlook

* Revenue guidance for AYVAKIT in 2025 is set between $680 million and $710 million, driven by increasing patient starts, low discontinuation rates, and growth in international markets.
* International expansion will include additional launches in Europe, with ISM pricing agreements expected in five new markets in 2025.
* COO Christina Rossi explained that field force expansion in the U.S. will enable engagement with several thousand more providers and broaden the diagnosed patient pool by 40%.
* Management reiterated confidence in achieving $2 billion in AYVAKIT revenue by 2030, supported by the growing SM market and further penetration into the diagnosed patient base.

### Financial Results

* AYVAKIT net product revenues for Q4 2024 were $144 million, with $124 million generated in the U.S. and $20 million internationally. Revenues for the full year reached $479 million.
* The company achieved a gross-to-net margin in the mid-80s and noted that its international business is expected to breakeven by year-end.
* Operating expenses are anticipated to rise modestly in 2025 due to commercial and R&D investments, including the development of elenestinib and BLU-808.
