Bloom Energy (NYSE:[BE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE "Bloom Energy Corporation")) +1.9% in Thursday's trading after saying it launched a [carbon capture partnership](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20001709-bloom-energy-and-chart-industries-announce-groundbreaking-carbon-capture-partnership "carbon capture partnership") with equipment manufacturer Chart Industries ([GTLS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTLS "Chart Industries, Inc.")) to generate near zero-carbon power using natural gas and fuel cells.

As part of the partnership, Chart Industries ([GTLS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTLS "Chart Industries, Inc.")) will use its carbon capture technology to process high-purity carbon dioxide exhaust stream that is a byproduct of Bloom Energy's (NYSE:[BE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE "Bloom Energy Corporation")) processes.

Efficient carbon capture depends on the purity of CO2 in the exhaust stream, which varies widely across power generation technologies; Bloom ([BE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE "Bloom Energy Corporation")) said its high-temperature fuel cell technology converts natural gas without combustion, yielding a CO2-rich stream that has 15x lower mass flow and 10x the CO2 concentration, making the capture process more efficient and less costly.

CO2 utilization offers a short-term mitigation to climate change, especially in areas where carbon storage infrastructure is not available.

"Our partnership with Chart aims to demonstrate that cost-effective, onsite baseload power from natural gas with carbon capture is feasible at scale," Bloom Energy ([BE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE "Bloom Energy Corporation")) Chairman and CEO KR Sridhar said.
