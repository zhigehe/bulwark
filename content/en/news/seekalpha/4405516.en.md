Emerson Electric ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) said its $265 a share tender offer for Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) is its "best and final" price after prominent active Elliott Investment Management has said the bid is too low. Aspen Technology fell 2.7% in premarket trading. 

"The $265 per share price is Emerson's best and final price, which was actively negotiated over a period of almost three months between Emerson and the AspenTech Special Committee," Emerson said in a [statement](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19996419-emerson-issues-statement-at-launch-of-aspentech-tender-offer " statement ") on Monday.

The statement comes after Elliott on Friday [disclosed owning a more than $1.5 billion stake](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405115-aspen-technology-gains-on-report-elliott-opposes-terms-of-emersons-takeover " disclosed owning a more than $1.5 billion stake ")  in Emerson ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) and said it has no intention of tending its share for the Emerson ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) offer.

"Emerson believes that the AspenTech Special Committee, comprised of three AspenTech independent directors, has significantly greater knowledge of AspenTech and its outlook than a short-term stockholder who has acquired stock in AspenTech for the purpose of merger arbitrage," Emerson said in the statement.

Late last month, Emerson ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) agreed to buy the shares of Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) it didnâ€™t own for [$265 a share.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398828-emerson-electric-agrees-to-acquire-remaining-aspen-stock-for-7_2b#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews " $265 a share.")Emerson in November originally proposed to buy Aspen (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) [for $240 per share](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4247336-emerson-offers-to-buy-rest-of-aspen-tech-for-240-share-in-cash#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews " for $240 per share ") and boosted its offer to $265 last month.
