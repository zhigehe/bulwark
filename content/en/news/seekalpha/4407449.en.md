Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) CEO Elon Musk intends to pull back his $97.4B bid for OpenAI's non-profit arm if the maker of ChatGPT does not become a for-profit entity, *Reuters* reported, citing Musk's lawyers in a court filing.

"If (the) OpenAI board is prepared to preserve the charity's mission and stipulate to take the "for sale" sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid," the filing [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musk-withdraw-openai-bid-if-board-agrees-charity-terms-lawyers-say-2025-02-13/ "said").

Otherwise, "the charity must be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets." The filing cited Musk's "serious offer" was made to enhance the charity's goals.

Earlier, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stated, "OpenAI is not for sale." at the AI Action Summit in Paris. "OpenAI's mission is not for sale - to say nothing of the fact that, like, a competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, 'I'm gonna buy this" with total disregard for the mission is a likely path there,‚Äù Altman [added](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405988-openai-chief-restates-company-not-for-sale-after-elon-musk-led-bid "added").

Musk sued Altman and others in August and requested U.S. district judge to block OpenAI's attempt to transition to a for-profit entity.

Musk reportedly said that the company's original mission of creating open-source technology that is not subject to corporate priorities has been undermined with Microsoft (MSFT) being the largest investor in OpenAI.

Tesla and OpenAI did not immediately reply to Seeking Alpha's request for comment.
