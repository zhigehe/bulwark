Earnings Call Insights: Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:[GPRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPRE "Green Plains Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Todd Becker, President and CEO, announced significant restructuring efforts aimed at achieving $50 million in annualized cost savings, with $30 million already implemented. Actions include a smaller corporate workforce, winding down innovation platforms, and executive leadership changes.
* The company shut down its 120-million-gallon Fairmont facility due to unfavorable market conditions and acute regional corn supply issues from flooding. The plant remains on cold idle but could be restarted if market conditions improve.
* Becker emphasized the strategic shift from innovation to commercialization, particularly in protein and oil products, and highlighted a record aquaculture sale to South America.
* CFO Phil Boggs reported Q4 revenues of $584 million, down 18% year-over-year, attributed to lower market prices for ethanol, corn oil, and distillers grains. Green Plains posted a net loss of $54.9 million or ($0.86) per share, impacted by noncash tax adjustments. EBITDA for the quarter was negative $18.9 million.
* Boggs also highlighted $209.4 million in cash and equivalents and $200.7 million available under a working capital revolver.

### Outlook

* Becker reaffirmed the company’s readiness to begin carbon capture operations in Nebraska in the second half of 2025, with projected annualized earnings of $130 million based on $70 per ton carbon credit values.
* The company anticipates achieving the full $50 million in cost savings within 90 days, with Phase 2 of restructuring efforts commencing immediately.
* Becker noted industry conditions remain challenging but highlighted favorable forward curves in Q1 2025, supported by anticipated record ethanol export levels of 1.9 billion gallons in 2024 and expectations for 2025 to exceed this.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenues declined 18% year-over-year to $584 million due to weaker ethanol and coproduct pricing. Plant utilization was 92% for the quarter, with continued improvements expected excluding the idled Fairmont plant.
* SG&A expenses decreased by $7.2 million year-over-year to $25.6 million. Restructuring efforts are targeting SG&A reductions to $0.02-$0.03 per gallon from the current $0.08-$0.09 per gallon.
* Capital expenditures for 2024 were $95 million, with expectations for maintenance and plant-related CapEx in 2025 ranging between $20 million and $35 million, excluding $110 million in carbon capture equipment.

### Q&A

* Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners, inquired about the $50 million cost-saving breakdown. Becker explained the focus on transitioning from innovation to commercialization, cutting non-core activities like in-house fish feeding trials.
* Jordan Levy, Truist Securities, asked about the Clean Sugar project. Becker highlighted strong customer interest in low-carbon dextrose and ongoing efforts to solve wastewater challenges to scale production fully.
* Saumya Jain, UBS, probed into corn oil pricing dynamics. Becker noted distillers corn oil is trading at a $0.04-$0.05 premium to soybean oil, with expectations for further price appreciation.
* Matthew Blair, TPH, questioned ethanol industry oversupply. Becker acknowledged elevated production but noted robust export demand and potential for quick stock drawdowns during the driving season.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism regarding restructuring efforts and carbon monetization potential but remained concerned about near-term profitability and ethanol market challenges.
* Management maintained a slightly positive tone, emphasizing strategic progress and cost-saving measures, though defensive when addressing weak Q4 results and delayed Clean Sugar scaling.
* Compared to the prior quarter, management’s tone reflected higher urgency to address cost structures and operational inefficiencies, while analysts remained consistent in probing structural industry concerns.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Management shifted focus from innovation to profitability, highlighted by the Fairmont plant shutdown and aggressive SG&A restructuring. This contrasts with the prior quarter’s emphasis on scaling Clean Sugar and protein production.
* Analyst questions transitioned from strategic growth initiatives to detailed inquiries about cost reductions and profitability outlooks.
* Q4 margins were notably weaker than Q3, with EBITDA turning negative. However, management reiterated confidence in carbon capture and protein initiatives to drive future earnings.
* Sentiment shifted slightly more defensive this quarter as management faced scrutiny over short-term financial performance.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged challenges in the macroethanol market, including high production levels and elevated stocks, compounded by weak global protein markets.
* Wastewater capacity limits continue to hinder Clean Sugar scaling, though technical solutions are being explored.
* Analysts raised concerns about the potential repeal of 45Z tax credits, though management expressed confidence in bipartisan support for these incentives.

### Final Takeaway

Green Plains is undergoing a major transformation, with restructuring efforts targeting $50 million in annualized savings and a strategic pivot from innovation to commercialization. While near-term challenges in ethanol margins and protein markets persist, the company remains focused on monetizing its carbon capture initiatives, which are expected to contribute $130 million annually starting in late 2025. Cost discipline and operational efficiency are now central themes as Green Plains positions itself for long-term growth and profitability.
