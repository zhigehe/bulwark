We wrote on Aptiv (NYSE:[APTV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV "Aptiv PLC")) in [October last year](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724999-aptiv-a-value-stock-backed-by-quality-and-growth "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724999-aptiv-a-value-stock-backed-by-quality-and-growth") with a buy rating. They revised growth and earnings lower in their third quarter. Share prices sank 18% from $69.07 to $56.83. Even though the prices have partially recovered, the market remains challenging and growth remains subdued. The company remains highly profitable and cash-generative and growth is expected to return over the mid-term. At current prices, the company is significantly undervalued. With the short-term price momentum turning positive, it is a good time to buy this value stock.

The Company & Financials
------------------------

Growth has stalled across the industry in which APTV predominantly operates. North America accounts for approximately 36% of revenues and saw a decline of 1% in FY24. EMEA accounts for 33% and saw a revenue decline of 4%. Asia, which accounts for 29% of revenues, saw a modest increase of 1%. Overall, APTV FY24 revenues were $19.7bn, a decline of 2%, significantly below its initial guidance of $21.6bn provided in its FY23 results. The company improved margins and adjusted net income significantly to $1,607m, and EPS of $6.26, compared to $1,376m, or EPS of $4.86 in FY23.

The company has embarked on an aggressive share buyback program. They spent a total of $4.1bn in repurchasing shares during FY24. The higher net cash from operating activities of $2.45bn, compared to last year's $1.90bn was partially used for the share buyback with the remaining financed using debt. The company increased leverage from a net debt of $5.1bn in FY23 to $7.3bn in FY24, up 43%. However, with improving margins, the net debt to EBITDA increased from 1.7x to 2.2x, up only 29%. The higher debt initiated during Q3 increased interest expense from £285m to $337m in FY24. We can expect interest expense to be higher for the full year in 2025.

Aptiv is a technology company that reports under two segments, Signal and Power Solutions (A&PS) & Advanced Safety and User Experience (AS&UX). Together, they serve the automotive sector by designing and manufacturing vehicle components for their customers to help them infuse more technology and build more software-enabled vehicles. Increasing vehicle connectivity and evolving government regulations regarding safety and emissions are the main trends driving growth. With APTV’s technological know-how and requirements for increasing complexity and advancing requirements of the “brain” and “nerves” of vehicles, they are well-positioned to address these issues and evolving trends.

They are one of the largest vehicle technology companies serving the world's largest 25 OEM automotive suppliers. They have a presence in 49 countries, over 21,000 employees, and operate 140 major manufacturing facilities and 11 technical centers.

Signal and Power Solutions designs, builds, and supplies the electronic architecture for vehicles. These components provide safety-critical systems, signal distribution, and computing power infrastructure, reduced emissions, higher fuel economy, and off-vehicle connectivity. For FY24, this segment accounted for 71% of total revenues, which fell by 3%. The lower vehicle sales and production slowed, resulting in an impact on demand for vehicle electrical systems. However, margins continued to improve with a move to greater automation and a shift to more production in lower-cost Central America and North Africa.

Advanced Safety and User Experience make vehicles safer, more secure, comfortable, and convenient for the end users. The components include connectivity systems, electronic controllers, cloud-native software platforms, and autonomous driving technologies. For FY24, this segment accounted for 29% of total revenues and saw a modest increase of 2%. Apart from the weakness in Europe, China, and North America saw some growth. Operating margins improved as engineering footprints increased in lower-cost countries, predominantly India. The adoption of Wind River’s DevSecOps tools has also helped in the more efficient development of software. APTV acquired Wind River in 2022, for $3.5bn. Wind River is a leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge. Using AI, machine learning, and IoT, intelligent edge computing models develop solutions close to the source for mission-critical systems in aerospace, industrial, defense, medical, telecom, and automotive.

Overall revenue growth was lower, mostly due to lower vehicle production by select larger customers. With 2025 overall vehicle production to decline by 3%, the need for more technology-infused and evolving safety regulations will help APTV maintain its dominant position in the market.

2025 Macro Vehicle Production Outlook (APTV Q4 Presentation)



APTV’s market share will also improve over the mid-term as the [global sales of vehicles](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-of-automotive-industry-worth-104-million-units-by-2030--marketsandmarkets-302184849.html "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-of-automotive-industry-worth-104-million-units-by-2030--marketsandmarkets-302184849.html") are expected to see a CAGR of 2.4% with an increasing market share of more technology-hungry EVs and hybrids. We expect APTV to be back to healthy growth over the medium term, in line with the [automotive software and electronics market growth rate](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mapping-the-automotive-software-and-electronics-landscape-through-2030 "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mapping-the-automotive-software-and-electronics-landscape-through-2030") of approximately CAGR of 5.5%.

Despite higher labor costs, the cost-cutting initiatives mentioned above, more notably, automation and moving production to lower-cost environments, margins are expected to improve in FY25.

Management expected approximately 2% in revenue growth for FY25 and with constant shares outstanding, a mid-point EPS of $7.3, up approximately 16%.

Risks
-----

The advances in AI and higher computing power required by computers may cause a shortage of semiconductors. Competition from cheaper or in-house development, particularly from China, can adversely affect APTV. President Trump is looking to revoke Biden’s 50% EV target by 2030 by erasing tax credits offered to EV purchases. There is also the uncertainty regarding tariffs and counter-tariffs to be imposed by the US and other countries.

Historical Financial Analysis
-----------------------------

Let us quickly recap on the historical financial performance of APTV. Revenues fell in FY20 during COVID-19 from FY19 $14.4bn to $13.1bn. These have now recovered and stand at $19.7bn, up at a CAGR of 10.7% over the past 4 years. Due to the prolific share buyback program, the revenue per share has increased by a CAGR of 11.6%, to over $76.9 per share, up from FY20’s $49.6.

APTV Asset Turnover (ROCGA Research)



Asset turnover, as a measure of efficiency, decreased as revenues and margins fell in 2020. Also, a point to note is that in 2020, the company held on to its cash, halted its share buyback program, and we also saw $2bn of investments in affiliates on the balance sheet, all contributing to increasing assets, but not revenues.

Separation Of Electrical Distribution Systems Business
------------------------------------------------------

[Earlier that year](https://ir.aptiv.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Aptiv-Announces-Intention-to-Separate-Its-Electrical-Distribution-Systems-Business/default.aspx "https://ir.aptiv.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Aptiv-Announces-Intention-to-Separate-Its-Electrical-Distribution-Systems-Business/default.aspx"), APTV announced its intention to separate by tax-free spin-off its Electrical Distribution Systems Business (EDS). The separation is expected to be completed early next year. EDS will provide low-voltage and high-voltage electrical architectures for automotive and commercial vehicle markets. Management estimates EDS had revenues of approximately $8.3bn in FY24 with $0.8bn of adjusted EBITDA. Over the medium term, EDS is expected to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth. Aptiv will consist of Advanced Safety & User Experience and the Engineered Components Group and will target mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth.

Valuation & Conclusion
----------------------

Mid-term growth is expected to be high-to-mid single-digit and margins will continue to improve. APTV already has superior [profitability](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV/profitability "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV/profitability") compared to the sector average. Over the mid-term, [revenue growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV/earnings/estimates "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV/earnings/estimates") is expected to be in line with the automotive software and electronics market. The consensus EPS estimate for FY25 is $7.25 giving us a PE of 8.9x. With superior profitability and growth, we would like to see APTV trading at the very least at the [sector average PE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UHS/valuation/metrics "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UHS/valuation/metrics"). The sector average forward Non-GAAP PE of 16.95x gives us a target price of $123. The short-term price momentum has also turned positive. We maintain our buy rating.
