Earnings Call Insights: Pyxus International, Inc. ([OTCPK:PYYX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYYX "Pyxus International, Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Pieter Sikkel highlighted an "outstanding third quarter" with revenue growth driven by increased volume and gross profit per kilo. He attributed the performance to proactive purchasing and leveraging the company’s global footprint to mitigate challenges like the El Nino weather phenomenon.
* Sikkel announced an increase in full-year guidance, projecting adjusted EBITDA between $205 million and $215 million and revenue in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion.
* CFO Flavia Landsberg detailed a 47% third-quarter revenue growth to $778 million, supported by a 20% increase in average sales price and a 24% rise in volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $81 million.
* Landsberg noted that gross profit reached $117 million, despite a decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue due to regional mix and El Nino impacts.

### Outlook

* Management raised full-year revenue guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion, up from the previous $2.15 billion to $2.35 billion range. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was also increased to $205 million to $215 million, compared to the prior $175 million to $195 million range.
* Sikkel expressed confidence in meeting customer demand through the remainder of the fiscal year, emphasizing improved crop sizes and quality in South America and promising conditions in Africa.
* Landsberg highlighted expectations of strong adjusted free cash flow in Q4, supported by delayed Brazilian crop purchases and normalized shipments.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for the third quarter was $778 million, a $249 million increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $81 million, bringing the nine-month total to $180 million.
* Gross profit for the quarter was $117 million, up from $93 million in the prior year, with average gross profit per kilo increasing to $0.91 from $0.83. However, gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to 15% from 17.5% due to weather-related regional mix effects.
* SG&A expenses for the quarter were $47 million compared to $42 million the previous year, reflecting disciplined expense management.
* Processed tobacco inventory declined to $603 million from $659 million in the prior year, with only $22 million of uncommitted inventory, signaling strong demand.

### Q&A

* Rosemary Sisson, Odeon Capital, asked about gross profit per kilo. Landsberg clarified that the increase was driven by growth in the higher-margin cut rag business rather than e-liquids, which remained flat.
* Sisson inquired about the significant increase in trade receivables. Landsberg explained it was due to higher sales volumes, reflecting a normal cash cycle.
* Oren Shaked, BTIG, sought direction on Q4 cash flow. Landsberg pointed to improved cash flow due to delayed Brazilian crop purchases and normalized shipments, despite not providing specific guidance.
* Shaked asked about fiscal 2026 margin dynamics. Sikkel noted expectations of better volumes and margins driven by improved crop sizes and quality, particularly in South America.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed a positive tone, congratulating management on strong results and raising strategic questions about margins, growth, and capital structure. Sisson noted undervaluation compared to peers, suggesting confidence in the company’s financial trajectory.

* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone reflected increased confidence, driven by higher guidance and improved financial performance.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Gross profit per kilo improved sequentially, while gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined due to adverse weather effects, contrasting with Q2's more stable margin environment.
* Management’s tone showed higher confidence in addressing El Nino-related challenges and leveraging improved crop conditions for fiscal 2026.
* Analysts maintained a consistent focus on growth opportunities, margins, and capital structure, with discussions in Q3 highlighting potential refinancing and undervaluation relative to peers.

* Landsberg noted ongoing efforts to improve cash flow and reduce leverage, with a focus on refinancing options to lower borrowing costs.
