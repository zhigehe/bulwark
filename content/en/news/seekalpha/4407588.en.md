Elliott Management has disclosed a nearly 5% stake in BP (NYSE:[BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) worth almost £3.8B (~$4.75B), making it the company's third largest shareholder, *Financial Times* reported Thursday.

The activist investor is trying to push the troubled company to cut spending on renewable energy and make big divestments, the [report](https://www.ft.com/content/25cd4cac-631f-467c-a372-00d0fdb2dfe0 "report") said.

Only BlackRock and Vanguard hold larger stakes in BP (NYSE:[BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")), at 9% and 5% respectively.

News of an Elliott stake broke [last weekend](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405379-elliott-has-built-stake-in-bp-report "last weekend"), and CEO Murray Auchincloss pledged a "[fundamental reset](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406027-bp-ceo-pledges-fundamental-reset-as-q4-profit-drops-60 "fundamental reset")" of BP's ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) strategy as he released another set of disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday.

BP ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) is due to unveil its plans at a capital markets day on February 26, and it is not yet clear if those plans will be sufficient to satisfy Elliott, which hopes to see an aggressive chair supported by an engaged board pushing for the reset, according to the report.
