A group led by Elon Musk has made an unsolicited $97.4B bid for the non-profit entity that controls generative artificial intelligence darling OpenAI, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Marc Toberoff, Musk's lawyer, said a bid was submitted to OpenAI's board of directors on Monday. In a statement provided by Toberoff, Musk wrote that "it is time" that OpenAI returns to the "open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," the news outlet [added](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-openai-bid-4af12827).

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. However, Chief Executive Sam Altman appeared to respond to the report and [said](https://x.com/sama/status/1889059531625464090 "said"), "[N]o thank you, but we will buy twitter [sic] for $9.74 billion if you want."

The bid comes as Musk is in the process of suing OpenAI. Last month, he and his lawyers, including Toberoff, had [asked](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4393868-musk-attorneys-ask-judges-to-auction-off-openai-stake-report) judges in the states of California and Delaware to cause an auction that would force OpenAI to sell off a portion of its business.

Musk's messy history with OpenAI
--------------------------------

Musk and his lawyers filed an injunction in November 2024 in an effort to stop OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit structure. The injunction also attempted to prevent OpenAI from engaging in what Musk's lawyers claimed was anticompetitive behavior.

OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Musk, current Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and several others. By the summer of 2017, Musk "agreed that a for-profit was the next step for OpenAI to advance the mission," OpenAI said in a post on its website last month.

By that fall, Musk "demanded majority equity" in the company, along with what OpenAI called "absolute control" and the requirement that he be named Chief Executive in the for-profit company.

That September, Musk created the public benefit corporation called Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.

Following the creation of the corporation, OpenAI said it rejected Elon's terms "because giving him unilateral control of OpenAI and its technology would be contrary to the mission."

A few months later, in March 2018, Musk resigned as co-chair of OpenAI.

OpenAI's value
--------------

OpenAI, creator of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, has raised billions of dollars in funding in recent memory, including a $6.6B funding round in October 2024 that [valued](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4155621-openai-becomes-third-largest-startup-following-latest-funding-round-report) the company at $157B.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) has invested approximately $14B into OpenAI, including joining the most recent funding. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank ([OTCPK:SFTBY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY "SoftBank Group Corp.")) is also reportedly discussing investing $40B into OpenAI — with $10B of that siphoned off to other investors — that would value it at $260B, according to [recent media reports](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405146-softbank-may-invest-40b-into-openai-report).

SoftBank and OpenAI were also a part of President Trump's recent AI-focused Stargate Project [announcement](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397132-stargate-project-receives-official-announcement-from-trump-openai "announcement"), with Musk conspicuous by his absence. Musk has [made](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397475-anthropic-ceo-musk-question-stargate-project-as-questions-remain "made") some disparaging comments about the announcement, including claiming SoftBank did not have the money for the initiative.

Musk, who heads up OpenAI competitor xAI, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for allegedly putting "profit over humanity." (xAI recently [raised](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4340335-xai-on-track-to-top-100m-in-annual-revenue-release-standalone-grok-app-report) funding that valued the company at $50B and just [unveiled](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4393704-xai-officially-launches-standalone-grok-app-on-ios) a standalone app for its Grok chatbot on iOS.) He dropped the initial lawsuit, but re-opened it this past August on the basis that the original lawsuit "lacked teeth."

Musk's lawsuit also recently [added](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4295683-microsoft-now-targeted-as-elon-musk-amends-openai-lawsuit) Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Dee Templeton, a current Microsoft executive who previously worked at OpenAI, as co-defendants.
