The new Netflix Bites Vegas restaurant is now open for walk in customers at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The unique restaurant pop-up concept features dishes and drinks inspired by some of Netflix's (NASDAQ:[NFLX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX "Netflix, Inc.")) most popular productions. A similar restaurant in Los Angeles in 2023 saw strong traffic and created viral buzz during its one-month run.
