Lyft’s (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) Q4 results demonstrated its effective cost discipline, pricing dynamics, and consistent rider growth, along with a successful partnership with DoorDash ([DASH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASH "DoorDash, Inc.")) which contributed to the company’s 8th consecutive quarter of double-digit rides growth.

But the shares headed south at the open, retreating to their lowest level in 4-months as FY25 outlook that showed a deceleration in bookings growth spooked investors and underscored pricing pressures that have plagued the industry (Lyft and Uber) in Q4 and now into Q1.

“Despite the slight weakness in bookings guidance, we see the platform headed in the right direction,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham, “And think the significant valuation disparity between LYFT and UBER should close partially over time.”

Added Seeking Alpha analyst Richard Durant, “Lyft's results were fairly solid, though, and the dramatic shift in the company's fortunes over the past few years has gone largely unnoticed.”

Which also includes narrowing the gap with Uber ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")), less on scale, but more on driver and passenger satisfaction, both of which have contributed to increased driver retention and driver preference, assisted by Lyft’s (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) price-lock feature and ETA performance.

All of which begs the question, what’s wrong with Lyft (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) shares on Wednesday?

Besides Lyft's lackluster bookings guidance, Wall Street is likely all too aware of the competitive dynamics that favor Uber ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")).

“This raises a larger question regarding LYFT’s long-term ability to grow and compete against UBER,” which has the capital to invest in an autonomous fleet and drive long-term AV adoption, said Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak.

Lyft (NASDAQ:[LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) will attempt to compete on the AV platform with partnerships like those announced this week with May Mobility in Atlanta and Japan’s Marubeni.

“They’ll be the first to use Mobileye, other partners Lyft-ready AV technology with the goal of deploying their fleet to thousands of vehicles on the Lyft platform over time,” Lyft CEO David Risher said on the company’s earnings call.

Long term, however, the AV market share could “ultimately be won by a small number of players such as Waymo and others,” TD Cowen’s John Blackledge cautions, citing the long-term transition to AV as a risk to his $14 price target.

“The Robotaxi market is beginning to take shape, with Waymo continuing to expand, and Tesla planning on launching in Austin as soon as June. This represents a serious threat to incumbent ride-hailing companies, particularly if supply is concentrated amongst a small number of financially strong companies,” agrees Durant.

Analysts are largely bullish on Lyft ([LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) with Seeking Alpha authors and Wall Street analysts are giving the stock a Buy rating. Seeking Alpha’s Quant rating is more cautious, rating Lyft ([LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")) as a Hold with a 3.14 Quant score out of 5.

Uber ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")) on the other hand, is also rated as a Buy by both analysts and Seeking Alpha authors, but the SA Quant rating gives it a Strong Buy with a Quant score of 4.76 out of 5. Seeking Alpha’s Quant rating is based on attributes like EPS revisions, value, profitability, etc., that are weighted to maximize a predictive value. Stocks that are rated as a “Strong Buy” have outperformed the S&P 500 by 5x.
