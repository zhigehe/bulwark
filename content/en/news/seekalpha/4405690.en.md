OppFi (NYSE:[OPFI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPFI "OppFi Inc.")) stock tumbled as much as 16% in Monday trading after the consumer finance company's shares doubled in the past month and quadrupled in the past six months. It reached an all-time high of $17.73 on Friday.

Some 3.86M shares changed hands, more than triple its full-day three-month average volume of 1.20M. It has ~21.2M shares outstanding. Short interest in the stock stands at 22.3%.

There's no obvious news explaining the double-digit decline, but investors may be locking in some of the gains of the past year.
