* Aclarion (NASDAQ:[ACON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACON "Aclarion, Inc.")) has received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its 24th issued [US patent](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997876-aclarion-receives-us-patent-to-protect-expanded-applications-of-magnetic-resonance).
* Whereas previous issued patents in the Aclarion portfolio limit the use of propionic acid identification by magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the disc, this new patent expands Aclarion’s ability to use MRS to identify PA throughout the body to identify potential sources of infection and pain.
* “While propionic acid is a normal human physiological metabolite, there are many known side effects and disorders associated with propionic acid,” said Jeff Lotz, PhD, Vice Chair of Research, University of California at San Francisco.
