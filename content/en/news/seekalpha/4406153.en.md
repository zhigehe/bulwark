JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said Tuesday the mid-year trough narrative regarding the bank's net interest income "is still in play," noting "not much has changed" since the 2025 guidance introduced in January, which assumed one or two Fed rate cuts.

The Jamie Dimon-led bank [sees 2025 NII, excluding markets,](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4395041-jpmorgan-chase-q4-earnings-beat-as-investment-banking-rebounds-nii-holds-up "sees 2025 NII, excluding markets,") of ~$90B as balance sheet growth partially offsets lower rates. Overall, the JPM expects NII of ~$94B, market dependent, compared with the $92.6B reported for 2024.

With deposit growth "sort of reasserting itself," NII is still expected to trough in mid-2205, Barnum said in a fireside chat at an industry conference hosted by UBS. Of course, much of this will be dependent on the Federal Reserve's rate path.

Barnum noted that JPMorgan's (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) sensitivity to the Treasury yield curve was the biggest factor in its 2024 NII guide, which had changed meaningfully throughout the year. He specifically pointed to persistent volatility in rate expectations and the performance in JPM's deposit franchise.

JPMorgan ([JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) shares slipped 0.3% in Tuesday morning trading.
