Bambu Productions





**Mowi ASA** ([OTCPK:MHGVY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHGVY "Mowi ASA")) presented good Q4 2024 results, driven by positive climatic conditions in Norway and improving margins from feeds. Mowi acquired a large competitor (Nova Sea), adding 10% production capacity, while global supply lags demand.

The stock now trades at a $10 billion market cap, and after integrating Nova Sea, I expect it to generate $780 million in net income. Assuming 4% production growth and some price appreciation, the valuation appears fair but not overly compelling. I maintain my Hold rating, waiting for a better entry point, but considering Mowi a quality operator.

Q4 2024 Results
---------------

**Good climate helping**: Mowi delivered record-high production volumes in Q4, primarily due to optimal climatic conditions in Norway. The cold winter has reduced biological problems, setting up strong production figures for early 2025. The same occurred in Northern Europe locations like Scotland, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland.

**Margins improve in feed waterfall**: Mowi's feed costs began to decline in 2023 but continue to trickle into results because of the salmon farming cycle (~3 years from egg to harvest). The full impact of lower costs will be gradual and will continue to be a tailwind into FY 2025.

**Concentration on Norway furthered**: Despite its global footprint, Norway remains Mowi’s profit engine, contributing more than 70% of EBIT. Scotland and Chile provide meaningful additions, each accounting for roughly 10%. Other regions remain marginal, reinforcing Mowi’s status as a primarily Norwegian operation. The acquisition below will add to this situation.

**Global supply continues behind demand**: For decades, global salmon supply has been behind demand in a certain way, moderating the traditional cycles of commodity products. FY 2024 was no different, with Mowi reporting 4% demand growth and 3% supply growth. It was a good year for Norway (up 5.5% in the quarter versus last year).

Mowi was ahead of Norway for the year (3% growth versus 2% for the region), but behind in the quarter (3% versus 5.5%).

Nova Sea Acquisition
--------------------

Mowi increased its stake in Nova Sea from 45% to 95%, acquiring the additional 50% for EUR 700 million.

The deal adds 50 thousand tonnes of production, allowing the company to reach 600 thousand by 2026—three years earlier than previously guided.

At an average EBIT per kg of EUR 2 in Norway, this acquisition theoretically adds EUR 100 million in pre-tax EBIT. With an implied total enterprise value of EUR 1.4 billion, the purchase price implies a high multiple (14x EBIT, 20X NOPAT).

Management likely sees potential to enhance yields and extract synergies. I tend to believe they can do so, given the company's impressive ROCE and operational figures.

**Debt higher but manageable**: Following the acquisition, net debt will rise from EUR 1.87 billion to EUR 2.42 billion. Given Mowi’s effective interest rate of ~7.3%, annual interest expenses should reach approximately EUR 175 million. While leverage is increasing, it is very well covered by EBIT (more than EUR 1 billion, according to my estimates below).

Valuation Is Fair But Not Super Attractive
------------------------------------------

By 2026, once the acquisition is fully integrated, Mowi will have expanded production by 20%. Based on prior cycle-average assumptions (reflected in my previous article from [Q3 2024](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734400-mowi-undergoing-negative-salmon-cycle-swiftly-but-not-an-opportunity)), we can estimate revenues of $7.56 billion (at stable exchange rates). Applying an operating margin of 16.8%, this translates to $1.3 billion in operating income. After deducting $182 million in interest expenses and applying a 30% tax rate, net income should be around $780 million.

At a $10 billion market cap, this implies an earnings yield of roughly 8%. Adding 4% annual production growth and potential pricing tailwinds of 2–3%, total return potential sits around 14–15%.

This is fair and many would consider it good even, but not particularly exciting for me. Given the quality of Mowi’s operations, it remains a solid business, but I maintain my Hold rating, waiting for a more attractive valuation.
