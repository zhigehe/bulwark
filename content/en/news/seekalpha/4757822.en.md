Introduction
------------

Per my November [article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734875-amazon-aws-is-poised-for-continued-excellence-with-operating-margin-and-revenue), AWS (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) is poised for continued excellence. One of the reasons for this is because employees are getting more efficient in both the AWS and the non-AWS segments. Since the time of that article we have the 4Q24 numbers. My thesis is that Amazon employees are getting more productive.

### The Numbers

10-K filings show Amazon went from 1,525,000 full-time and part-time employees in 2023 to 1,556,000 in 2024, an increase of just 2%. Cash flow statements show stock-based compensation (“SBC”) decreased from about $24 billion in 2023 to approximately $22 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, sales increased 11% from $574,785 million in 2023 to $637,959 million in 2024. Looking at the 4Q24 [release](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/AMZN-Q4-2024-Earnings-Release.pdf), we see sales increasing and SBC falling YoY for each segment:

Segment sales (4Q24 release)





One of the reasons productivity is increasing is because Amazon employees are using AI effectively. In both the 3Q24 call and the 4Q24 call, CEO Andy Jassy spoke about the ways Amazon Q is increasing production for Amazon’s internal systems. He also [posted](https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281?lang=en) about it on X. Here is what AWS [said](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/amazon-q-developer-just-reached-a-260-million-dollar-milestone/) about it in August:

> Amazon has migrated tens of thousands of production applications from Java 8 or 11 to Java 17 with assistance from Amazon Q Developer. This represents a ***savings of over 4,500 years of development work for over a thousand developers*** (when compared to manual upgrades) and performance improvements worth***$260 million dollars in annual cost savings***. To determine the true business impact of Q Developer-assisted app upgrades, we estimated the time saved by looking at the number of Java dependencies we migrated.

A September AWS [post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improve-employee-productivity-using-generative-ai-with-amazon-bedrock/) shows AI architecture which makes internal and external employees more productive with technologies like AWS Lambda:

### Valuation

The competitive landscape is a meaningful part of my thought process with respect to valuation. Amazon’s 1P sales and 3P GMV estimates have been growing much faster than sales at Target (TGT\_ and Walmart ([WMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT "Walmart Inc.")). Shopify ([SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")) is an operating system as opposed to a retail channel, but I like to look at their GMV relative to the estimated GMV for Amazon 3P. The clear trend is an increase in online commerce which benefits Shopify and Amazon immensely. Amazon has been doing more volume per employee in 2024:

These are some of the numbers I think about with respect to valuation ($ in millions):

|  | North  America  Operating  Income | Intl.  Operating  Income | AWS  Operating  Income | North  America  Sales | Intl.  Sales | AWS  Sales | Total  Operating  Income | Total  FCF Excl.  Leases &  Financing | Total  Operating  Cash  Flow | Total  Sales |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1Q23 | $898 | $(1,247) | $5,123 | $76,881 | $29,123 | $21,354 | $4,774 | $(8,282) | $4,788 | $127,358 |

For 2023, the annual operating income and FCF excluding finance/lease obligations were about the same. Growth capex investments increased prodigiously in 2024 as the operating income was well above FCF excluding finance/lease obligations. These operating income and FCF numbers were $36,852 million and $36,813 million, respectively, for 2023 while they were $68,593 million and $38,291 million, respectively, for 2024. Of course no discussion of FCF is complete without talking about SBC which fell from $24 billion in 2023 down to $22 billion in 2024.

The operating margin for North America has been improving rapidly, going from 4.2% for 2023 up to 6.5% for 2024. Additionally, the International operating income switched from being negative in 2023 to positive in 2024. Eventually, I’m optimistic that the overall non-AWS margin can reach 7%. Applying this to the 2024 non-AWS sales of $530,403 million and rounding to the nearest billion gives us a hypothetical operating income number of $37 billion. Applying a multiple of 35 to 40x gives us a non-AWS valuation range of $1,295 to $1,480 billion when rounded to the nearest $5 billion.

AWS had 4Q24 operating income of $10,632 million on sales of $28,786 million. The operating income margin for the quarter was nearly 37% and the run rate is $42.5 billion. I value the segment at 25 to 30x the operating income run rate, implying a range of $1,065 to $1,275 billion when rounded to the nearest $5 billion. This is a higher multiple than I use for Google ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) Cloud because Amazon was the first hyperscaler which gives them long-lasting advantages. This is a lower multiple than the non-AWS segment because the higher AWS capital intensity outweighs the higher AWS growth in my mind.

My sum of the parts valuation is as follows:

$1,295 to $1,480 billion non-AWS

$1,065 to $1,275 billion AWS

---------------------------------------

$2,360 to $2,755 billion total

Per the 2024 [10-K](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/e42c2068-bad5-4ab6-ae57-36ff8b2aeffd.pdf), there were 10,597,729,352 shares outstanding as of January 29, 2025. The market cap is $2,426 billion based on the February 12 share price of $228.93. This is in the lower part of my valuation range and I consider the stock a buy for long-term investors willing to hold it for at least 3 years.
