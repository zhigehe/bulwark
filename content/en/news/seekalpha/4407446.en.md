JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) CEO Jamie Dimon has derided a petition by some employees for the bank to roll back its five-day return-to-office policy, *Reuters* reported, citing a recording of a town hall meeting on Wednesday.

Employees have complained about losing hybrid-work arrangements on internal message boards, leading to an online petition calling on Dimon to reconsider the five-day policy. The petition received about 950 signatures by Wednesday evening.

"Don't waste time on it," Dimon responded when asked about the [petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/professional-dignity "petition") during the town hall meeting. "I don't care how many people sign that f\*\*\*ing petition."

The CEO noted that some employees did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which affected their efficiency. He asked all departments to show 10% gains in efficiency, which is said to entail 10% cuts in reports, meetings, and training sessions.

As for leaving in-office requirements to managers, Dimon [declared](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-derides-in-office-work-pushback-demands-efficiency-2025-02-13/ "declared"): "Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary."

Dimon's views echo those of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is working to end remote work arrangements in the federal government.

JPMorgan (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) last month told its employees that they must return to the office five days a week starting early next month. About 40% of the bank's employees currently work on a hybrid schedule.

According to employees petitioning to reverse this move, the staff's work "continuously produced record profits for the bank - all while working from home and from the office in a hybrid manner."

The petition comes as some JPMorgan ([JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) employees have reached out to the Communications Workers of America on how to unionize. The CWA recently helped Wells Fargo ([WFC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WFC "Wells Fargo & Company")) employees in an Albuquerque branch to unionize - a first for a major U.S. bank.
