Wall Street on Friday delivered a slight decline for a busy week that was marked by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war escalation, the fourth quarter earnings season deluge, and economic data on the labor market.  
  
Trump dominated headlines this week with his tariff moves. Last weekend, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico went into effect, but both North American nations showed a willingness to work with Trump, leading to a delay in the implementation of the tariffs. Trump also approved a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. The world's second-largest economy, in stark contrast to Canada and Mexico, responded with its own duties on imports of multiple American products, including [LNG, coal, and more.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402411-tit-for-tat-china-hits-back-with-tariffs-on-u_s_-coal-lng-vehicles)  
  
Finally, Trump on Friday said he was planning to announce "reciprocal tariffs," where if any country puts tariffs on American goods, the U.S. will respond with "[the same exact tariff."](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405350-trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-are-coming-so-what-are-they)  
  
The earnings season continued to garner headlines, and this week saw quarterly reports from major names such as Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")), Walt Disney ([DIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS "The Walt Disney Company")), Uber ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")), and Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")).  
  
Turning to the economic calendar, labor market data was in the spotlight this week. It culminated in the January nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which showed a moderation in job growth but an [unexpected downtick in unemployment.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405109-nonfarm-payrolls-climbs-less-than-expected-in-january-unemployment-unexpectedly-dips)  
  
For the week, the benchmark S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500)) slipped -0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND "NASDAQ Composite Index")) shed -0.5%. The blue-chip Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI "Dow Jones Industrial Average Index")) also fell -0.5%.
