This article examines the US sectoral flows for January 2025 to assess their likely impact on markets as we advance into February 2025. It also includes an impact assessment of major Fed and White House decisions and policies on risk asset markets. 

A highlight this month is that I did an interview with Mr Alex King of Cestrian Capital Research, which [can be seen here](https://x.com/AlanLongbon/status/1889494423895155076). Cestrian Capital Research also has an investor group at Seeking Alpha, which [can be found here.](https://seekingalpha.com/author/cestrian-capital-research)

The table below shows the sectoral balances for the US, which are produced from the national accounts.

Note that the chart format has been upgraded to now show in the right column the monthly gain or loss of the ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")).

January is seasonally a bad month for fiscal flows and this year has been no exception, the good news is that February is much better. January saw a net addition of a very modest $42 billion liquidity surplus in the private domestic sector.

Going into detail: The $42 billion private sector funds surplus came from a normal $132 billion injection of funds by the federal government (and this includes the new injection channel from the Fed of around $5 billion from interest on reserves that went directly into the banking sector 85 + 5).

The banking sector contributed a very modest $13 billion and the reason for this could be the lack of treasury securities available for use as collateral, and this will be covered in more detail later in this article.

The chart below shows how well private credit markets are performing.

The external sector extracted -$103 billion from the private domestic sector and deposited it into foreign-held bank accounts at the Fed (the external sector X) in return for imported goods and services.

The chart below shows the sectoral balance data plotted in nominal terms. The calculation is federal government spending or G, plus the external sector (X and usually a negative factor). The result is how much money enters or leaves the private domestic sector or P, an accounting identity true by definition.

Last month the chart predicted the ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) red line should follow the green private domestic sector balance line down and finish the same or lower than it started, and this did indeed happen. This month the green private domestic sector line has made a weak movement upward and this suggests the ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) will finish flat to slightly higher this month. Negative headlines this month could well see the markets finishing lower given the weak fiscal background on the grounds of weak investor sentiment. Financial liquidity thermodynamics are a solid base from which to predict market moves, however sentiment events affecting human behavior can play a key role as well in the amplitude of those moves and can tip the balance when other supporting factors are weak like they are now.

The table below shows the total federal government withdrawals from their accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank. A withdrawal by the federal government is a receipt/credit for the private sector and therefore a positive for asset markets.

The table shows that total Federal government outlays made a small decrease month over month but are still moving in the $3 Trillion+ range. This month we have a negative red flush in that all fiscal factors were negative. Despite the big spending, the deficit was only small because almost as much money was extracted as injected.

The chart above plots the 20-year average of the ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) together with key fiscal milestones marked as colored lines along the X-axis.

Fiscal milestones coming up: The good news is that there is a large treasury interest payment at the beginning of February and no major federal tax collections. Plain sailing for a good two months.

One cannot overlook that the blue ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) makes on average a seasonal peak that turns into a major seasonal low in the middle of March. This is the lagged impact of the row of tax collections through December of the previous year and in the middle of January, weakening background fiscal conditions. This negative cumulative fiscal effect recovers in the middle of March when financial balances in the private sector start to rise again and is often a good time to initiate new long equity positions.

At the White House, factors the new president might implement that might affect risk asset markets are listed below.

1. A big tax cut

2. A tariff war on our trading partners

3. Federal government efficiency drive

4. Deregulate the financial industry

The first one is by far the most important for risk asset markets. Estimates vary, however the tax cuts could bring as much as $1.1 trillion of deficit spending per year into the economy.

> Trump pitched his latest tax-cut priorities in a closed-door meeting with House Republican leaders Thursday, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, Social Security benefits and providing new tax breaks for goods manufactured in the US. Trump has also proposed lifting the limit on the state and local tax deduction known as SALT, after his earlier tax bill capped that deduction at $10,000 per household.

Source: [Bloomberg](https://www.msn.com/en-ie/money/other/trump-tax-cuts-cost-estimated-at-5-trillion-to-11-trillion/ar-AA1yBoks)

The above would come with an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals and small business owners. Those cuts expire at the end of 2025.

The most remarkable thing about these tax cuts is that many are aimed at sections of the community that need them, such as eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits, and lifting the limit on the state and local tax deduction known as SALT. This tax relief impacts lower income earning people that 1. It should not be taxed at all, and 2. Have a high propensity to spend most of their income, in fact, they often spend more than they earn as they take on personal debt to make ends meet in everyday life.

The chart below shows how an injection of an extra $1 trillion of deficit spending might impact risk asset markets.

The orange ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) line has been broken down into fiscal years and these are marked with dotted vertical purple lines. Each fiscal year has an array of dotted, colored lines originating at the start. The lines represent different levels of federal deficit spending from a modest $1 trillion per year in blue, $2 trillion a year in green, and $3 trillion a year in black.

One sees from the chart that the higher the federal deficit spend the steeper the SPX climbs.

The chart below shows federal government deficit amounts since 2000.

The chart above shows that in the last few years, the trajectory of the deficit spending has been in the $2 trillion range and that this current fiscal year is on track to be much the same. If the Trump tax cuts can be enacted, this could well put the deficit spend trajectory into the $3 trillion per year range. If this were to happen, risk asset markets could well respond as they did in 2020/21 with a much steeper upward trajectory and make record gains.

The formula for big-risk asset market gains is this:

Federal Deficit ↑ = Private Surplus ↑ = Risk Asset markets ↑

The bigger the fiscal input, the larger the private sector surplus and risk asset gains in the macro.

One factor that has gone little reported is that the debt limit on the Federal government has still not been raised or removed.

This brings us back to our discussion on bank lending mentioned above. A debt limit means that no new treasury securities are allowed to be made. These T securities make up a key component of bank lending collateral. Bank lending as noted above was very modest last month after many months of strong growth.

The chart below shows, black line, how the creation of new treasury securities has flat lined. This is very serious as the ultimate measure of systemic liquidity is the stock of treasuries. If the stock of treasuries is not growing, it is prima facie evidence that liquidity growth has stopped.

Many will try to explain this away as market sentiment, as they have no idea why borrowers are not seeking loans. The real reason is mechanical in that the treasury drought is crimping capital ratios and banks are capital-constrained and not reserve-constrained.

The chart below shows the drop-off in treasury collateral held by banks.

[![US bank treasury collateral](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/6770371-17393515135584192.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/6770371-17393515135584192_origin.png)

Other than affecting the ability of banks to extend loans, it also has an impact on bond markets. Treasury securities are used to drain reserves from the banking system so that the interest rate stays in the Fed's target range. If there is not a constant supply of treasury securities to do this with, then the Fed could lose control of interest rates. What happens is that there will be a build-up of excess reserves in the system and this leads to less competition for those reserves among banks wanting to secure them to meet their required reserve positions in the overnight market and thus the interest rate would eventually fall to zero if not for the interest on reserve balances [IOR] that puts a floor under the policy rate.

The current IOR is shown in the table below.

[![Interest Rates on Reserve Balances](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/6770371-17393586850882132.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/6770371-17393586850882132_origin.png)



Federal Reserve Bank





Lower interest rates across the board would not be such a bad thing all things considered, however a treasury drought and a lack of systemic liquidity ultimately lead to the financial system gumming up, slowdowns, shutdowns, and ultimately recession.

It will not be long before the bank lobby starts pushing for a resolution of the debt limit problem due to the US bank lending mechanism gumming up. Bank credit is a component of every good and service in the economy.

The Federal Reserve concluded its January 2025 meeting, leaving unchanged its overnight borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%.

The following chart plots key indicators used to estimate what the Fed might do next, and has proven very predictive.

The chart shows that the Fed has reason to pause the FFR. This is indicated by some of the leading co-factors on this chart. The 10-year bond yield and employment have ticked up. CPI has risen slightly. Initial claims have risen. This is an indecisive constellation of co-factors where the CPI (after the Feds logic that higher interest rates lower inflation) rising means that rates should remain higher whereas initial claims rising gives ground for interest rates to be lower. In such as situation, the most likely outcome is that the Fed will continue to hold and pause and watch.

In the last two major interest-raising campaigns, from 2004-2008 and then from 2017 to 2019, one sees a similar pattern of a rolling flattening top that can last years followed by a small step downward and a short pause, a recession event, and then a massive move downward move in the FFR.

This pathology looks likely to repeat, and we are at the start of the pause after the small step downward after the brunt of the interest-raising campaign.

In each of the other interest-raising campaigns, the recession started less than a year after the Fed's first downward movement of the FFR.

At the world macroeconomic level, we have the G5 chart below. The chart shows the spending level by the top five world governments (the G5) in a change rate format together with a range of risk assets such as gold ([GLD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD "SPDR Gold Trust ETF")), crypto ([OTC:BITW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BITW#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link "Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund")), and the stock market ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")).

The brown G5 fiscal expenditure line shows a peak in 2025 starting at the end of quarter 1 of 2025 and rising into the second quarter of 2025. This is firm ground for rising risk asset markets through most of this year and aligns with the broad seasonal pattern shown earlier in this article.

The G5 chart provides good grounds for a market entry in line with the 20-year SPX average chart shown earlier in this paper in mid to late March.
