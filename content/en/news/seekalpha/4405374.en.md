India and the United States dominate the list of new users for DeepSeek's artificial intelligence assistant app, with the Chinese rivals accounting for a quarter of the new users.

India contributed 18% of new users between January 11 and February 2, while the U.S. accounted for 7.4%, according to Appfigures data that excluded third-party app stores in China. 

The South Asian nation banned ByteDance ([BDNCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNCE "ByteDance"))-owned TikTok and nearly 60 other Chinese apps in June 2020, after the conflict erupted into violence at their border.

TikTok [went dark](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4396395-tiktok-goes-dark-in-the-us) briefly in the U.S. last month, but came back online after assurances from President Donald Trump's administration. The U.S. is pushing for divestment of TikTok's American operations from its Chinese parent.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant app has [held on to the top spot](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402194-deepseek-app-retains-no-1-ranking-in-global-downloads) among free apps in the U.S. on Apple's ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) App Store and Google's ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) Play Store since late January.

The launch of the Chinese startup's AI model [rattled Silicon Valley](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398699-chinese-ai-lab-deepseek-rattles-silicon-valley) and Wall Street, as it outperformed American rivals and was developed at a fraction of the cost, sparking a tech selloff that caused a [$1 trillion market wipeout](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399000-nvidia-broadcom-lead-tech-stocks-lower-amid-deepseek-ai-impact).

However, companies and governments around the world have moved to restrict the use of DeepSeek's app due to concerns about potential data leaks.

As of February 2, DeepSeek had reached 30 million downloads globally, according to Appfigures data.
