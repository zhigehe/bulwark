* Lucey highlighted challenging market conditions in Q4 2024 due to weak margins and poor crude differentials. He expressed optimism about longer-term market dynamics, citing global refining supply-demand balance and forward cracks as constructive.
* Michael Bukowski, Senior Vice President, outlined the company’s Refining Business Improvement Program targeting $200 million in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025.
