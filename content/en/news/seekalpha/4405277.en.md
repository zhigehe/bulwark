US Steel (NYSE:[X](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X "United States Steel Corporation")) quickly fell 8% after President Donald Trump said that Nippon Steel ([OTCPK:NPSCY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NPSCY "Nippon Steel Corporation")) is considering investing in the steelmaker, but won't purchase the entire company.

Trump made the remarks at a press conference after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier on Friday, according to several media reports. 

US Steel shares reversed an earlier gain after a CBS report that Trump was going to allow the $14 billion deal to go through after former President Joe Biden blocked it earlier this year.
