Globalstar (NASDAQ:[GSAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSAT "Globalstar, Inc.")) is expanding its Commercial IoT business to cater to the growing need for 5G connectivity in the next generation of automation. As the US reindustrializes and automates factories with robotics, fast, constant connected networks will be required to maintain optimal operations. The firm has also partnered with Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) for direct-to-mobile through the launch of 50 new MDA satellites; however, the project was recently brought into question following the announcement of Apple’s partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile for direct-to-mobile connectivity. Despite this factor, I believe Globalstar’s Commercial IoT business will support its growth initiatives and bring consistent profitability to the firm. I am rating GSAT shares with a HOLD with a price target of $20.36/share at 20.91x eFY25 EV/aEBITDA.

Globalstar Operations
---------------------

In q3’24, Globalstar received FCC approval to extend its existing authorization, HIBLEO-4, by 15 years and to operate up to 26 replacement satellites. As part of this, Globalstar is expanding its wholesale consumer business by adding a new satellite constellation, expanding its ground infrastructure, and increasing its global MSS licensing. This should support Globalstar’s growth in its wholesale business as the firm works to enter into commercial services. Management is anticipating that Globalstar will enter into beta testing in eq1’25 in order to bring the product to a broader customer base.

Globalstar expanded its [MDA Space agreement](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mda-space-now-prime-contractor-for-globalstar-s-satellite-network-in-expanded-c-1-1b-deal-da15a847 "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mda-space-now-prime-contractor-for-globalstar-s-satellite-network-in-expanded-c-1-1b-deal-da15a847") for 50 MDA Aurora software-defined digital satellites for its LEO constellation. The deal, valued at $769mm, may be in support of the firm’s partnership with Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) in expanding services across a mobile satellite-services network. The payments under this contract will include an additional $400mm sale of 20% equity in the special purpose entity (SPE). The prepayments and cash raised through the equity sale will be utilized by Globalstar to finance the capital outlay for the expanded constellation.

[The partnership with Apple began](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/11/globalstar-ceo-paul-jacobs-listing-nyse-nasdaq.html?msockid=2096c300c5916d023a2cd135c4f16cb9 "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/11/globalstar-ceo-paul-jacobs-listing-nyse-nasdaq.html?msockid=2096c300c5916d023a2cd135c4f16cb9") with enabling emergency satellite texting. The expansion of the partnership aims at expanding iPhone users’ service to areas that aren’t covered by towers, similar to Starlink’s partnership with T-Mobile ([TMUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS "T-Mobile US, Inc.")). As part of this, there is the idea that, being a late entrant, Globalstar may face some headwinds to launching the additional satellites if Starlink were to increase its communications satellite capacity and expand beyond texting with T-Mobile. [According to Starlink’s website](https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell "https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell"), texting has been available since 2024, data and IoT will be available sometime in 2025, and voice is “coming soon.” Starlink currently has 10 partner telcos, including T-Mobile and Rogers in Canada.

Accordingly, Globalstar should realize a significant step-up in revenue following the launch of these satellites, potentially doubling the firm’s revenue generation. This constellation may also bring Globalstar beyond emergency connectivity in the direct-to-mobile market.

In its XCOM RAN business, [Globalstar announced a strategic partnership](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/liquid-intelligent-technologies-and-globalstar-partner-deliver "https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/liquid-intelligent-technologies-and-globalstar-partner-deliver") with Liquid Intelligent Technologies for exclusive distribution rights for its XCOM RAN private 5G network. Services will be available across Liquid Intelligent Technologies’ geographies in Africa, the Middle East, and the Gulf. Accordingly, this network will be leveraged by industries in remote, desolate areas, like the mining industry. Having 5G network availability will support high-speed internet needs, such as AI applications on-site, that weren’t previously available.

Globalstar is expanding its go-to-market strategy for its XCOM RAN business as it expands its bandwidth to [include band n53](https://www.globalstar.com/en-us/terrestrial-wireless/band-n53 "https://www.globalstar.com/en-us/terrestrial-wireless/band-n53") spectrum, targeting high-end automation and enterprise consumers. Accordingly, adding the mid-band can expand the firm’s reach into handsets and infrastructure ecosystems, supporting ports, mines, offshore energy platforms, and industrial facilities. Applications for the spectrum span fixed wireless broadband, autonomous vehicles, enterprise operations, and IoT. [Globalstar’s n53 spectrum](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hawk-networks-and-globalstar-announce-collaboration-and "https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hawk-networks-and-globalstar-announce-collaboration-and") is available across the US and 11 other countries. [On December 12, 2024](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-achieves-first-5g-data-call-xcom-ran-band-n53 "https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-achieves-first-5g-data-call-xcom-ran-band-n53"), Globalstar achieved its first 5G data call with XCOM RAN on Band n53 spectrum with 100Mbps download and 60Mbps upload speeds.

As part of this, Globalstar recently announced a collaboration agreement with Hawk Networks to enhance Globalstar’s ability to bundle licensed spectrum with core network components and other infrastructure to provide access to operators across the wireless spectrum. The partnership will integrate CBRS Band 48 and 53 spectrum in Hawk Network’s Althea Core and the Althea platform.

Management anticipates that the n53 spectrum can provide significant value to Globalstar. Globalstar has roughly 1b points of presence covered and 10bMHz POPs, 40% of which are in the US. Accordingly, the spectrum can be worth between $0.50-2/MHz-POP in the US, implying between $1-4/share for spectrum. I believe that this can be a major opportunity for Globalstar, especially when considering that the customer base will primarily be enterprises.

Globalstar Financial Position

[![Corporate Reports](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-17394757275292127.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-17394757275292127_origin.png)



Corporate Reports



Looking through Globalstar’s financials, it is clear that the firm is working down its legacy businesses, Duplex and SPOT, as the firm transitions its attention on Commercial IoT. Over time, services will continue to cater to emergency services in which the satellite coverage will broadly cover desolate regions wholistically rather than strictly for emergency services. As a result of this, I am modeling a steady decline for Globalstar’s legacy services as they phase out. I anticipate that this will impact ARPU as well.

[![Corporate Reports](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-17394757325449286.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-17394757325449286_origin.png)



Corporate Reports



Globalstar’s government services should also grow as the firm scales its coverage for government agencies.

As for Commercial IoT, I suspect that this segment will experience strong growth in the coming years as reindustrialization occurs in the US, especially with autonomous operations with robotics in warehouses and manufacturing.

Looking to eq4’24, I’m forecasting Globalstar to generate $60mm in net revenue and a diluted EPS of -$0.02/share. Looking to eFY25, I’m forecasting Globalstar to achieve positive margins as the IoT business scales. I'm forecasting revenue to grow by 10% on a year-over-year basis to $275mm with a diluted EPS of $0.05/share for eFY25.

Do note that the financial table above [applies the 15-for-1 reverse stock split as announced on February 7, 2025](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-transfers-nasdaq-global-select-market "https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-transfers-nasdaq-global-select-market"). Stock splits and reverse splits do not impact shareholder's holdings in terms of value, nor does it impact the stock's valuation. The best way to think about this is valuing the company based on its market cap or enterprise value as opposed to on a dollar-per-share basis. When a reverse stock split occurs, fewer shares will be outstanding and will trade at a higher price, implying the same market cap.

Risks Related To Globalstar
---------------------------

#### Bull Case

Globalstar is transitioning its business to cater more heavily to Commercial IoT, a relatively untapped market for the satellite company. The firm is also launching 50 satellites to expand its network coverage for direct-to-mobile uses as well as to broaden its services for desolate work regions, like offshore oil platforms and mining sites. Each successful launch can act as a positive catalyst for the firm. Stable profitability will also be a positive catalyst for GSAT shares.

#### Bear Case

Globalstar’s broadband market is expanding with multiple entrants potentially taking market share potential from the firm including Starlink ([SPACE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPACE "SpaceX")) and [AST SpaceMobile](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745076-ast-spacemobile-faces-major-competition-from-spacex "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745076-ast-spacemobile-faces-major-competition-from-spacex") ([ASTS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS "AST SpaceMobile, Inc.")). Despite the market expanding, the direct-to-mobile initiative is still relatively novel and has yet to reach its full potential for voice calls and data. In addition to this, Apple’s partnership with Starlink may create significant headwinds for Globalstar as Apple is a core component for its direct-to-mobile initiative.

Corporate Reports



GSAT shares currently trade at 23.25x EV/aEBITDA following a large decline from its recent high of 36x. Shares declined in recent weeks resulting from the news of Apple partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile for its satellite constellation for direct-to-mobile service.

[![TradingView](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-1739475745802334.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/16009792-1739475745802334_origin.png)



TradingView



Shares may continue this decline as Apple was marked as a major partner for Globalstar’s growth initiative, potentially leading to a pivot in market potential for the firm. Despite the potential shift in dynamics, I believe Globalstar’s IoT business has the potential to support the business and its growth initiatives.

Using an internal valuation model based on my adjusted EBITDA forecast and GSAT shares’ historical trading premiums, I am rating GSAT shares with a HOLD and a price target of $20.36/share at 20.91x eFY25 EV/aEBITDA.

Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums. The trading premium array is derived through the normal operating cycle, with the blue-sky scenario being the stock’s peak multiple and the gray-sky scenario being the lowest point. The target multiple aims for the midpoint, or the most likely trading range for the company’s stock. The trading multiples from there are set to a probability factor based on the likelihood of the stock trading at that premium, base on its historical presence. From there, the trading multiple is tied to the probability factor to derive its relative market cap and relative multiple.
