Intel (NASDAQ:[INTC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC "Intel Corporation")) shares rose 3% and outperformed the broader market and technology sector on Monday as reviewers praised its latest processor, the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX.

A number of reviewers, including [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2592394/intels-new-laptops-cpus-last-forever-but-i-didnt-expect-the-performance-leap.html "PCWorld") and [TomsHardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/core-ultra-9-275hx-beats-amds-flagship-ryzen-9-mobile-chip-by-7-percent-in-passmark-34-percent-faster-than-the-i9-14900hx "TomsHardware"), both cited the performance of the Core Ultra 9 275HX, and the battery life boost provided to laptops. Others, such as [Notebook Check](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-Ultra-9-275HX-becomes-fastest-laptop-processor-on-PassMark.958865.0.html "Notebook Check"), noted the Core Ultra 9 275HX has become the fastest processor on the market, surpassing AMD's ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")) Ryzen 9 7945HX3D chip, citing tests conducted by PassMark.

AMD shares also rose on Monday, gaining 2.9% in late morning trading.

Intel's fourth-quarter results, which it [reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401419-intels-q4-beat-estimates-but-analysts-remain-cautious-on-challenges-ahead "reported") last month, topped consensus and appeared to show the positive results of the company's mass restructuring plan it undertook in 2024. However, [concerns](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401419-intels-q4-beat-estimates-but-analysts-remain-cautious-on-challenges-ahead "concerns") about the guidance kept Wall Street analysts on hold as they await further signs of a recovery.

To that point, the semiconductor giant is holding an Intel Foundry Direct Connect event in San Jose, Calif., on April 29, to share details of the foundry's strategy, process technology, and advanced packaging and test capabilities.

The company is also in the process of finding a replacement for former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who [abruptly](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4353857-intel-announces-ceo-gelsinger-retiring-replaced-with-co-ceos "abruptly") retired late last year. Some reports have suggested that the company's board of directors [lost confidence](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4354960-gelsinger-forced-out-at-intel-after-board-lost-confidence-report "lost confidence") in Gelsinger's vision to try and turn around the fortunes of the storied Silicon Valley giant.

Gelsinger was replaced by co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus.
