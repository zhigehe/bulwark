**Assicurazioni Generali** ([OTCPK:ARZGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARZGF "Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.")) has presented recently a strategy update that was quite similar to the previous one, focusing mainly on growing organically its business and returning most of its earnings to shareholders over the next three years.

As I’ve covered in [previous articles](https://seekingalpha.com/author/labutes-ir/analysis?ticker=ARZGF), Generali is an interesting income play in the European insurance sector, even though I saw its shares as being fairly valued when I last covered it some months ago. Despite that, its shares have performed quite well in recent months, supported by a good operating performance and its recent [strategy update](https://www.generali.com/investors/reports-and-presentations/investor-day/Generali-Investor-Day-2025) that was well received by investors.

Regarding its business model, Generali aims to maintain its composite profile, which means it has both life and non-life operations in the insurance industry, plus it’s also a relatively large player in asset management. This is a business profile that is different from U.S. peers, which usually are much more specialized in specific insurance lines, operating only in one sub-segment of insurance (life or non-life).

However, it’s much more normal for insurance companies in Europe to have exposure both to life and property & casualty (P&C or non-life) operations, which has some diversification benefits and capital relief from regulators, at the expense of specialized knowledge among specialty insurance lines.

Moreover, as insurance companies hold significant investment portfolios, it’s also common to have a specific asset management unit, which can be both dedicated to managing in-house investments as well third-party money. This is also a distinctive factor compared to U.S. insurance companies, which usually only manage in-house money.

Generali is a good example of how large European insurance companies are organized, having a combination of insurance and asset management platforms, a strategic profile that is not likely to change much going forward.

Operating model (Generali)





While in insurance operations the company has a strong position and size in the industry, in asset management its size was not among the largest. Given this profile, Generali has recently [announced](https://www.generali.com/investors/reports-and-presentations) a strategic partnership with the French bank BPCE to combine their asset management operations, through a new joint-venture company.

This joint venture will be equally owned by Generali and BPCE, and have balanced governance and control rights, combining Generali Investments Holding and Natixis Investment Managers into a single entity. This will create a larger player in the asset management industry, holding about €1.9 trillion of assets under management (AuM), ranking among the ten largest world players by AuM. This will increase the newco’s competitive position in the industry by increasing its size and distribution capabilities across Europe and the U.S., something that would be much more difficult for BPCE and Generali to develop on their own, plus it’s also expected to reach significant revenue and cost synergies over the next few years.

This business combination needs to get several regulatory approvals and is expected to close by early 2026. Thus, it’s not expected to have an impact on Generali’s financial performance in the short term. When completed, this transaction is expected to be accretive to Generali’s earnings from year one and be neutral for its solvency II capital ratio.

Regarding its insurance operations, its business strategy is not much different from what the company has done in recent years, while its strategy for the next few years is focused on improving its operations and deliver a good customer service to grow its business over the coming years.

Generali sees better growth prospects in its P&C operations, targeting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-9% in operating results over 2024-27 in this segment, while in life its operating result CAGR is expected to be 4-5% during this period. This growth is expected to come from a higher top-line, but also from efficiency improvements as the company expects to invest around €1.2-1.3 billion during 2024-27 in Artificial Intelligence and technology across the group, aiming to reduce costs and business complexity.

Taking this background into account, its main financial targets are to increase earnings per share at a CAGR of 8-10% during 2024-27, generate more than €11 billion in cashflow at the holding level during the next three years, and increase its dividend per share by more than 10% annually from 2024-27.

On top of a growing dividend, the company also aims to perform share buybacks on a recurring basis, targeting at least €500 million of annual share repurchases. This still leaves some room for opportunistic acquisitions over the coming years (around €1.5 billion), which can be returned to shareholders at the end of its strategic plan (2027) if Generali doesn’t find attractive acquisitions over the next few years.

These capital return ambitions are supported by the company’s strong financial position, both due to a relatively low debt leverage ratio of 18% (most peers have debt leverage ratios between 20-30%), and a solvency II capital ratio of 209% at the end of last September. Its internal target is to be in the range of 180-230%. Thus, Generali is well capitalized right now and can distribute the vast majority of its earnings in the future, being a key supported for a sustainable dividend ahead which is expected to be complemented by share buybacks.

Indeed, its dividend payout ratio is expected to be around 56% related to 2024 earnings, and to remain below 60% over the next three years, which is a relatively conservative level and explains why Generali has room to grow its dividends, perform share buybacks and still have enough cash flow to perform small acquisitions in the near future.

However, as Generali’s shares have performed quite well over the past year, up by some 64% vs. 33% for the European insurance sector, its current dividend yield is less attractive than it was some months ago. At its current share price, its forward [dividend yield](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARZGF/dividends/scorecard) is 4.3%, based on its estimated 2024 dividend per share of €1.39, being nowadays below the average of the European insurance sector. Moreover, investors should be aware that Generali’s dividend frequency is annual, like many European companies, and its dividend withholding tax rate is 26%, reducing somewhat its income appeal for U.S.-based investors.

Regarding its valuation, Generali is currently [trading](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARZGF/valuation/metrics) at 1.7x book value and 11.8x forward earnings, valuation multiples that are both at a premium to its historical values of 1.1x and 9.1x, respectively, over the past five years. Compared to some of its closest compositive peers, such as **AXA** ([OTCQX:AXAHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXAHY "AXA SA")) or **Allianz** ([OTCPK:ALIZY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALIZY "Allianz SE")), Generali is also trading at a premium valuation following a strong share price rally in recent months. Given that Generali’s recent strategy update was not transformative, and its growth targets aren’t much different from what the company has delivered in recent years, this valuation seems to already reflect most of its growth ahead and upside potential seems to be limited. Moreover, income is usually an important factor for investors in the insurance sector and Generali is currently offering a below-average yield, being another reason to be cautious on its stock.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Generali has a relatively stable business profile and growth prospects are good compared to other insurance companies in Europe, but this seems to be already reflected in its share price. Its recent strategy update was not much different from what the company has been doing over the past few years, and its income appeal is now lower due to a strong share price rally in the recent past. Taking into account this background, my recommendation remains ‘hold’ as upside potential may be limited in the medium to long term.
