Nippon Steel ([OTCPK:NPSCY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NPSCY "Nippon Steel Corporation")) ([OTCPK:NISTF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NISTF "Nippon Steel Corporation")) is [considering a "bold" change](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/nippon-steel-declines-comment-trump-statement-opposing-majority-stake-us-steel-2025-02-10/) in plans from its previous approach of seeking to buy US Steel (NYSE:[X](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/X "United States Steel Corporation")), Japan's Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Monday, according to Reuters.

The revision would create a win-win situation for both Japan and the U.S. through significant investments and the production of high-quality products sought by the U.S. and global markets, Hayashi said.
