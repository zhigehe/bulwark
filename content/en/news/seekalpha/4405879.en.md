Earnings Call Insights: RCI Hospitality Holdings (NASDAQ:[RICK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RICK "RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Eric Langan highlighted key developments, including increases in Nightclub segment sales and same-store sales. Bombshells segment sales declined due to closures of underperforming locations, but operating profit and margins improved. Consolidated net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow matched year-ago levels.
* The company sold or closed five underperforming Bombshells locations since September 2024 and repurchased 66,000 shares for $3.2 million. It acquired the Flight Club in Detroit for $8 million, estimating $2 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, a new Bombshells location was opened in Denver.
* Langan announced leadership changes, with Rafael Pedraza promoted to Director of Operations for Bombshells to drive performance improvements.
* CFO Bradley Chhay reported Q1 sales of $71.5 million, reflecting reduced Bombshells footprint but supported by increased Nightclub sales. Adjusted EBITDA reached $15.7 million, and free cash flow was $12.1 million.
* Nightclub segment revenues rose by $0.7 million, driven by a 3.7% increase in same-store sales and the addition of three new or reformatted clubs. Bombshells revenues declined $3.1 million due to closures and a 7.5% same-store sales reduction.

### Outlook

* Langan reaffirmed the company’s five-year capital allocation strategy, aiming for $400 million in revenue and $75 million in free cash flow by FY29. The plan focuses on growing free cash flow per share by 10%-15% annually through club acquisitions, share buybacks, and debt reduction.
* The company targets acquiring $6 million in adjusted EBITDA annually from Nightclub acquisitions, maintaining a valuation range of 3-5x adjusted EBITDA for clubs and fair market value for real estate.
* Near-term objectives include completing Bombshells developments in Lubbock and Rowlett, Texas, and reopening Chicas Locas, El Paso on March 1, 2025. The company expects these projects to positively impact performance.

### Financial Results

* Q1 adjusted EPS was $0.80, and GAAP EPS was $1.01. Net income attributable to common shareholders totaled $9 million.
* Consolidated operating income increased to $20.9 million, with a 33.8% margin. Nightclubs saw a 1.1% revenue increase, with higher food, merchandise, and alcoholic beverage sales partially offset by lower service revenue. Bombshells’ operating income increased $1.9 million despite reduced revenues.
* Maintenance capital expenditures rose by nearly 30% year-over-year, which impacted free cash flow slightly.
* The company ended Q1 with $34.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 3.32x, slightly higher than the prior quarter’s 3.28x.

### Q&A

* Scott Buck, H.C. Wainwright: Asked about the $1.7 million insurance reserve and whether it was a one-time expense. CEO Langan clarified it was a one-time accrual due to the company’s decision to self-insure and did not affect adjusted EBITDA.
* Buck, H.C. Wainwright: Queried about Detroit club margins. Langan indicated it was too early to assess but expressed confidence in eventual margin improvements.
* Unidentified Analyst: Asked about planned sales from non-income-producing assets. Langan listed properties worth $23-$28 million that could be monetized within the next year.
* Adam Wyden: Questioned CapEx outlook. Langan stated maintenance CapEx for FY25 was expected to return to $6 million, with construction projects being bank-financed and near completion.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts demonstrated a neutral tone with focused inquiries on cost management, asset divestitures, and segment profitability.
* Management exhibited confidence during prepared remarks, with positive language such as “we are confident” and “we believe this is a great use of capital.” However, the Q&A segment revealed a more cautious tone when discussing challenges in the Bombshells segment and the Detroit acquisition.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management maintained a consistent focus on executing its five-year plan but showed increased defensiveness in addressing Bombshells closures and cost pressures.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language remained consistent with the five-year plan, emphasizing acquisitions and shareholder returns. However, Q1 introduced new leadership in Bombshells to address performance gaps.
* Analysts continued to focus on Bombshells challenges, as in the previous quarter, but also raised questions about the impact of asset sales and M&A activity.
* Nightclub segment sales continued to grow, while Bombshells’ same-store sales decline persisted, albeit less severe than the previous quarter.
* Management tone showed slightly more confidence in the Nightclub outlook but remained cautious on Bombshells performance.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged the challenges in improving Bombshells same-store sales and achieving target margins. The segment's operational difficulties remain a significant concern.
* Analysts raised concerns about the impact of potential lawsuits related to Bombshells closures and the ability to improve margins in newly acquired and opened locations.
* Weather-related disruptions remain a risk, with 14 days of closures reported for Nightclubs and seven for Bombshells in early Q2.

### Final Takeaway

RCI Hospitality Holdings outlined a robust five-year plan targeting $400 million in revenue by FY29, supported by strategic acquisitions and operational improvements. While the Nightclub segment continues to deliver growth, the company faces persistent challenges in the Bombshells segment, necessitating leadership changes and operational adjustments. With a focus on divesting non-income-producing assets and managing debt, RCI aims to enhance free cash flow and shareholder value over the long term.
