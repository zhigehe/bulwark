### Management View

* CEO Richard Pops highlighted 2024 as a transformative year focused on profitability and pipeline development, achieving over $1.5 billion in revenue and $450 million in EBITDA from continuing operations. The company ended the year debt-free with $825 million in cash and repurchased approximately 8 million shares.
* For 2025, Alkermes plans to generate over $200 million in EBITDA while advancing its orexin program, particularly ALKS 2680, which is enrolling Phase 2 studies for narcolepsy. These studies are expected to complete in the second half of 2025 and are anticipated to provide a robust dataset.
* Blair Jackson, COO, detailed 2024 financial achievements, including $1 billion in revenue from proprietary products and operational streamlining through the sale of its Irish manufacturing business.
* CFO Blair Jackson stated, "We are committed to maintaining a robust cash-generating business and expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $310 million to $340 million in 2025."

### Outlook

* The company anticipates total 2025 revenue between $1.34 billion and $1.43 billion, with $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion from proprietary products. Manufacturing and royalty revenues are expected to decline by $215 million due to the expiration of INVEGA SUSTENNA U.S. royalties and other legacy manufacturing transitions.
* Cost of goods sold is projected between $185 million and $205 million, R&D expenses between $305 million and $335 million, and SG&A expenses between $655 million and $685 million, reflecting strategic investments in its psychiatry sales team and promotional activities.
* For Q1 2025, proprietary product sales are expected in the range of $220 million to $240 million, with anticipated seasonality and inventory normalization affecting results.
* ALKS 2680 Phase 2 studies in narcolepsy are progressing, with data readouts anticipated in the second half of 2025.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue exceeded $1.5 billion, driven by 18% year-over-year growth in proprietary product sales. Net sales included $457.3 million from VIVITROL, $346.2 million from ARISTADA, and $280 million from LYBALVI.
* Inventory adjustments and favorable gross-to-net dynamics added approximately $35 million to Q4 results.
* Manufacturing and royalty revenue reached $474.1 million in 2024, with $236.4 million from INVEGA and $134 million from VUMERITY.

### Q&A

* Paul Matteis, Stifel: Questioned the risks associated with ALKS 2680's Phase 2 studies in NT2 and IH. Richard Pops emphasized variability in patient populations as the primary challenge but expressed confidence due to prior dose-dependent efficacy results.
* Charles Duncan, Cantor Fitzgerald: Asked about competitive dynamics for LYBALVI and ARISTADA. Todd Nichols noted a planned sales force expansion of 80 representatives to maintain competitive share and highlighted LYBALVI’s strong growth potential in bipolar and schizophrenia indications.
* Umer Raffat, Evercore ISI: Inquired about adjusted EBITDA guidance and expense increases. Blair Jackson clarified that the primary impact comes from reduced manufacturing and royalty revenues, while expense increases are modest and focused on strategic investments.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding the robust financial position and pipeline progress. Richard Pops emphasized the transformative potential of the ALKS 2680 program, stating, "We are planning for success and preparing for the pivotal program with manufacturing, protocol design, and regulatory workstreams all underway."
* Compared to Q3, management showed heightened confidence in operational execution, while analysts intensified scrutiny on competitive dynamics and market access strategies.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue from proprietary products grew year-over-year but included one-time inventory dynamics in Q4, contrasting with stable inventory levels reported in Q3.

* Analysts’ focus shifted from operational efficiency in Q3 to pipeline execution and competitive positioning in Q4.
* Management’s tone reflected increased confidence in pipeline milestones, particularly for ALKS 2680, compared to the cautious optimism expressed in Q3.

* Analysts raised concerns about the potential impact of competitive pressures from new antipsychotic entrants on LYBALVI and ARISTADA.
* Variability in patient populations for ALKS 2680 Phase 2 studies was highlighted as a key risk.
