Franklin FTSE Japan ETF (NYSEARCA:[FLJP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLJP "Franklin FTSE Japan ETF")) faces several risks that cast a shadow over this ETF, including the direction of the yen ([JPY:USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPY:USD#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews "Japanese Yen / US Dollar")) and the Japanese stock market. Let's examine in detail what could dampen the prospects of this ETF this year.

The yen and the Franklin FTSE Japan ETF
---------------------------------------

One of the main factors affecting this ETF's performance is the USD/yen exchange rate. To illustrate its impact, I compared the performance of the FLJP - while controlling for the changes in USD/yen - to the Nikkei225 after normalizing their prices to 100 at the beginning of 2022.

[![A chart showing the normalized prices of the FLJP and the Nikkei 225 from 2022-2025](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/798719-1739389411582715.jpg)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/798719-1739389411582715_origin.jpg)

While both assets are highly correlated, the ETF has outperformed the Nikkei225 since 2022 by roughly 10 percentage points. The difference between the two stems from their composition -the Nikkei225 is a price-weighted index, while this ETF that follows the FTSE Japan Capped Index is market-cap-weighted so that small-cap firms aren't included in it; that's why the ETF is more skewed towards large-cap firms in the financial industry and less to small-cap Tech firms relative to the Nikkei225. Specifically, the ETF's top sectors are Industrials and Consumer Discretionary at 42%. Within these sectors, the automotive industry is a major component as it accounts for nearly 12% of the ETF's assets, including top holdings such as Toyota Motor ([TM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM "Toyota Motor Corporation")) and Mitsubishi ([OTCPK:MSBHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSBHF "Mitsubishi Corporation")); since the auto industry is Japan's top [export](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/jpn) to the US, these holdings could suffer the most if a trade war with the US escalates (see below).

However, when I compared the two without controlling for the fluctuations in the USD/yen, a different image emerged: The ETF has underperformed the Nikkei 225 by 27 percentage points during the same time frame. This gap is mainly attributed to the appreciation of the USD against the yen.

In addition, I ran a simple regression to explain the changes in the [FLJP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLJP "Franklin FTSE Japan ETF") against the USD/ yen while controlling for several variables to determine its marginal effect on the ETF. The results indicate that in recent years, all things equal, for every 1% rise in the USD/ yen, the ETF fell by 0.3%.

These findings highlight the yen's effect on ETF, and due to its depreciation, the ETF has underperformed other benchmarks like the S&P500, especially in the past year.

So what's next for the yen?
---------------------------

The main drivers for the USD/yen will likely be the BOJ, the Federal Reserve, and the uncertainty over a possible trade dispute between Japan and the US.

The BOJ has been aiming to curb inflation, which reached 3.6% in [December](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/inflation-cpi) - well above its target of 2%. [Higher wage growth](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398305-whats-next-for-japan-as-the-boj-continues-raising-rates) has also raised concerns for the central bank, which exited its ultra-loose monetary policy last year. The BOJ's policy rate is currently at 0.5%. Still well below the Fed's funds rate, and even though the BOJ is expected to raise rates again this year, which should support the yen, the yen hasn't gained much ground against the USD. In recent months, it has even fallen below its March 2024 levels. Part of this development is related to the Federal Reserve's slowdown in its rate cuts path that offset the efforts of the BOJ to prop up the yen. So, at best, the two central banks' policies this year could be a wash for the USD/yen, but I don't rule out the Fed surprising the markets with no additional rate cuts this year, especially if Trump were to follow through with his promises to raise tariffs on many countries.

The prospects of rising tariffs
-------------------------------

And now, there is also a looming trade war between Japan and the US. The first fire has been shot just recently with the [calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/trump-ishiba-to-discuss-cooperation-on-ai-chips-in-first-meet?sref=qzusa8bC&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&embedded-checkout=true) by Trump for Japan to eliminate its trade imbalance with the US - something that Japan won't be able to fix.

During Trump's first term, the trade dispute with Japan ended with threats to impose tariffs that didn't really materialize (some tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum). It ended with some [concessions](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/japan-korea-apec/japan/us-japan-trade-agreement-negotiations/us-japan-trade-agreement-text?utm_source=chatgpt.com) from Japan on agricultural imports. However, Trump 2.0 isn't the same as Trump 1.0. In his first term, Trump considered raising tariffs on Europe, Mexico, and Canada, but he didn't follow through; this time seems different, with Trump being more vocal and adamant about imposing significant tariffs on all goods. The prospect of another clash between Japan and the US over trade could further weaken the yen, as was the case for the Canadian Loonie and Mexican peso when the [news](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-dollar-tumbles-trump-tariffs) of 25% tariffs on all imported goods to the US from Canada and Mexico, respectively, broke, which have since recovered after Trump delayed the tariffs.

The Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishiba, will try to appease Trump by making certain concessions, as Japan has previously done. However, the prospects of higher tariffs will still loom over the Japanese economy, as they could adversely affect Japanese firms with close ties to the US - especially in the auto industry - and weaken the yen.

Finally, even without considering the problems listed above, the growth prospects of Japanese firms seem lower than those of US companies. Indeed, the US's economic growth path is still set at a higher trajectory than Japan's. For example, [the US economy](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025) is expected to grow by 2.7%, while Japan's economy will barely rise by over 1% in 2025. Combine this outlook with the fact that the [BOJ won't support the stock market](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4581302) as it did in the past, and the expectations of higher interest rates in Japan could put additional downward pressure on Japanese stocks, and the FLJP ETF seems to offer little upside.

Bottom line
-----------

While the Japanese stock market had a solid year in 2024, too many issues could dampen the rally of this ETF, especially concerning the direction of the yen and the Japanese stock markets.
