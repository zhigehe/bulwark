* NetApp (NASDAQ:[NTAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTAP "NetApp, Inc.")) was in the spotlight on Monday as Susquehanna downgraded the data storage company, citing tough year-over-year comparisons and concerns that artificial intelligence revenue in the enterprise will not be "incremental" until 2026.
* Shares fell 1.5% in premarket trading.
* "Looking forward, we think there is increased downside risk to consensus, especially in the July and October quarters as compares become challenging, while Enterprise AI is not expected to help with incremental demand until CY26," analyst Mehdi Hosseini wrote in a note to clients. Hosseini lowered his rating on NetApp to Neutral from Positive and cut his price target to $130 from $155.
* Hosseini added that he believes that NetApp has taken market share and that the company will benefit from the rise of AI in the enterprise, but that should be a bigger impact next year. And with the stock having doubled since September 2023, now is the time to move to the sidelines, Hosseini added.
