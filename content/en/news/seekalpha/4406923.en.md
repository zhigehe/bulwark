BMO Capital Markets has downgraded Q32 Bio (NASDAQ:[QTTB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QTTB "Q32 Bio Inc.")) to market perform from outperform following the company's decision to discontinue development of its drug ADX-097.

The firm noted that Q32 (NASDAQ:[QTTB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QTTB "Q32 Bio Inc.")) decided to shelve ADX-097 to focus on developing bempikibart for patients with alopecia areata, or AA.

"While the decision seems to signal confidence in bempikibart, the drug's early clinical profile is not compelling enough to merit meaningful value beyond what we already assume," BMO said in a note.

BMO estimates a 15% probability of bempikibart achieving peak sales of around $830M in AA.

The firm said it was removing ADX-097 from its model and cutting its price target for the stock to $3 from $22.
