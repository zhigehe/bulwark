Robert Way



To buy or not to buy? I used to own positions in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:[BABA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")) ([OTCPK:BABAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABAF "Alibaba Group Holding Limited")), but I have since decided to reallocate the proceeds to other opportunities in the US, while still retaining exposure to benefit from the recovery of China’s e-commerce through Pinduoduo ([PDD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDD "PDD Holdings Inc.")).

Unfortunately, PDD’s performance has trailed BABA over the past one year, after failing to recover since it fell into a deep bear market from its peak in September 2024. Should I have allocated to BABA and not PDD? It's a reasonable question that has bothered me for some time, as while [I urged Alibaba investors to pull the buy trigger](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746830-alibaba-nothing-over-yet "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746830-alibaba-nothing-over-yet") in my previous article, I dithered, and didn’t do so in the end. That said, I must emphasize that there’s no room for regretting our decisions when it comes to investing. We enter (or don't enter) every position with our eyes fully open, and must be fully responsible for the consequences of our investing decisions, and make sure we never apportion blame to anyone else, including the market.

BABA/PDD price chart (weekly, medium-term) (TradingView)



The fact that Alibaba stock has outperformed PDD since December 2023 shouldn’t be understated as a mere coincidence. I had enunciated why Alibaba’s shift away from relying on China’s domestic e-commerce business to drive profitability must be carefully watched. While its [market leadership in China’s cloud computing business](https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-cloud-recognized-as-an-emerging-leader-in-the-gartner-emerging-market-quadrants/ "https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-cloud-recognized-as-an-emerging-leader-in-the-gartner-emerging-market-quadrants/") hadn’t translated to significant gains back then, I’ve never doubted Alibaba’s leadership in a highly competitive cloud marketplace in China. On the e-commerce front, the return of President Trump to the White House has also amped up the pressure on other leaders like Temu or Shein that previously capitalized on the US’s de minimus loophole to make substantial market share gains.

However, with the [Trump administration expected to close the de minimus loophole](https://www.wsj.com/business/why-trump-is-closing-a-trade-exemption-for-china-d0a5e597?mod=Searchresults_pos15&page=1 "https://www.wsj.com/business/why-trump-is-closing-a-trade-exemption-for-china-d0a5e597?mod=Searchresults_pos15&page=1") (after a temporal pause in implementing the said executive order), it seems like [Alibaba’s significant market share in China’s domestic e-commerce](https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5000066483?pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=22442 "https://www.dbs.com/insightsdirect/company/TR5000066483?pagesec=whatsnew&pagesecid=22442") and a more well-diversified international commerce segment have gained the market’s confidence, in lieu of Pinduoduo, as demonstrated by the outperformance of BABA/PDD seen in the chart above.

Therefore, BABA stock’s 60% gain over the past one year is by no means a fluke, I believe. DeepSeek ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) wowed the Chinese AI world with its breathtaking innovation that sent the US markets into a frenzy in late January, while also reigniting the market’s enthusiasm in Chinese equities. However, if you didn’t manage to pull the buy trigger back in December or early January this year, it seems like waiting for a pullback could be apt (more on that later).

So, what has gotten the market so excited about what the company has to offer, even as [Wall Street’s optimism on BABA seems mixed at best](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA/earnings/revisions "https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA/earnings/revisions"), as we head into Alibaba’s upcoming earnings release? One thing is for sure, [Alibaba Cloud has gotten ahead of Baidu](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/alibaba-s-stock-surges-after-investors-buy-into-iphone-ai-hopes "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/alibaba-s-stock-surges-after-investors-buy-into-iphone-ai-hopes") ([BIDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIDU "Baidu, Inc.")) with Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) and even DeepSeek with its [Qwen AI model that has topped the AI charts](https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-clouds-qwen2-5-max-secures-top-rankinks-in-chatbot-arena/ "https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-clouds-qwen2-5-max-secures-top-rankinks-in-chatbot-arena/"), showcasing its AI leadership.

[Apple Intelligence needs to find a reliable partner in China](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-partners-with-alibaba-to-develop-ai-features-for-iphone-users-in-china?utm_campaign=article_email&utm_content=article-14472&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sg&rc=3e6wgn "https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-partners-with-alibaba-to-develop-ai-features-for-iphone-users-in-china?utm_campaign=article_email&utm_content=article-14472&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sg&rc=3e6wgn") and has reportedly not been satisfied with what Baidu has to offer, notwithstanding the China’s search leader’s reputed AI capabilities. Analysts believe that it has the potential to drive growth, not just in Alibaba enterprise cloud opportunities. In addition, I believe the market also anticipates additional revenue opportunities in the consumer business through integration with Apple’s ecosystem in China, affording the e-commerce leader a vital gateway to the consumer AI business that has been dominated by ByteDance ([BDNCE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNCE "ByteDance")).

However, it seems like [Baidu has attempted to bolster its AI credentials](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406635-baidu-plans-to-launch-next-generation-ai-model-in-2025 "https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406635-baidu-plans-to-launch-next-generation-ai-model-in-2025"), as it is reportedly ready to launch its next-gen Ernie 5 LLM to up the ante against Alibaba and DeepSeek. Hence, the AI climate in China is tremendously intense, and I believe rapid developments aren’t expected to slow down, as the leaders attempt to outmaneuver one another to gain control of the AI narrative in enterprise and consumer AI applications. Also, until Apple officially announces its tie-up, I believe we must remain cautious, although it seems likely the market has already reacted positively to the news, building up on the surging momentum in the stock that has continued for the past five weeks. Are we closer to the buyer exhaustion phase yet, just as the financial media has stepped up their reporting about the returning of [animal spirits and risk-taking back into Chinese equities?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/china-hedge-funds-tempt-investors-who-pulled-cash-for-years?srnd=homepage-americas "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/china-hedge-funds-tempt-investors-who-pulled-cash-for-years?srnd=homepage-americas") Hedge funds have also raised their exposure, but are there risks over the horizon that we should not understate?

The market (both in the US and China) seems to have taken the [first salvo of the US-China trade war](https://www.wsj.com/tech/china-trade-war-us-tech-03578671?mod=hp_lead_pos2 "https://www.wsj.com/tech/china-trade-war-us-tech-03578671?mod=hp_lead_pos2") with less trepidation than I had expected, suggesting these headwinds have not diminished the market’s penchant for adopting a risk-on posture. It’s important to note that I believe [it’s foolhardy to assume that these trade tensions will not escalate](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-8f15f2a8?mod=Searchresults "https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-8f15f2a8?mod=Searchresults"), although China’s initial retaliatory response is arguably more measured, suggesting [Chinese President Xi Jinping seems keen to avoid a debilitating trade war](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-s-new-playbook-for-trump-tariffs-possible-trade-war-podcast "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-s-new-playbook-for-trump-tariffs-possible-trade-war-podcast") at the current juncture. Does that make sense?

Possibly. [China’s property market malaise has persisted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-11/china-s-real-estate-crisis-property-sector-debt-is-getting-worse?srnd=homepage-americas "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-02-11/china-s-real-estate-crisis-property-sector-debt-is-getting-worse?srnd=homepage-americas") as the multi-year decline could carry on since property sales peaked in 2021. Therefore, it could stymie the recovery of China’s consumption spending and confidence, impacting e-commerce leaders like Alibaba in the process. Based on the most updated reports, it seems like [near term sentiments in China's property market aren’t favorable.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-property-crisis-why-market-is-still-a-mess-what-government-is-doing?srnd=homepage-americas "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-property-crisis-why-market-is-still-a-mess-what-government-is-doing?srnd=homepage-americas") Therefore, I believe it might not be reliable to depend on Alibaba’s domestic consumer base to chart a more sustainable recovery in near term, suggesting its valuation might continue to be depressed.

Despite that, based on [BABA’s sum of the parts valuation framework](https://www.trefis.com/company?hm=BABA.trefis "https://www.trefis.com/company?hm=BABA.trefis"), local commerce is assessed to comprise less than 30% of its valuation, mitigating the downside risks if the property fallout were to persist through 2025. Hence, it’s imperative for Alibaba to demonstrate more confidence in its ex-China e-commerce business to drive valuation re-rating, although a possible escalation of the trade war could engulf the market’s confidence in it being actualized.

So, that leaves us with its cloud segment. While the segment’s contribution to Alibaba’s corporate adjusted EBITA has improved markedly over the past one year, from just under 3% to more than 5% in its most recently reported quarter, I don’t think it can reach the scale of Amazon Web Services ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) in the near to medium term. China’s highly competitive cloud computing market suggests pricing will likely continue to be a key driver of market share growth, suggesting driving profitability gains might not be the near term focus for China’s cloud leaders. Despite that, I believe the possible tie up with Apple could herald a golden era for Alibaba Cloud, validating its leadership, although we have also seen how China’s innovative capabilities suggest moat in LLM aren’t expected to be sustainable, suggesting we must not overstate current gains and expect them to persist in the future.

BABA price chart (weekly, medium-term) (TradingView)



While [I really enjoy reading financial news about Chinese equities](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-11/david-tepper-s-everything-china-trade-has-a-new-plot "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-11/david-tepper-s-everything-china-trade-has-a-new-plot"), I also tend to take them with a pinch of salt. No, I’m not saying that they aren’t credible, but we must also make astute judgments about whether these could be “after the fact, it has already happened” type of disclosures, suggesting the market has already moved and priced in the positive impact (like Alibaba’s possible tie up with Apple), even as I discuss this analysis with you. (Let me know what you think.)

Take a look at BABA’s price chart and momentum surge on the right-hand side of the above chart. Clearly, the resistance zone under the $120 level has stoutly held back against buying advances since July 2022. In other words, unless you have very high conviction that buying momentum can finally break out above this level during the current surge, I think some caution is justified, after BABA’s market beating performance.

Despite that, it’s also noteworthy to highlight that BABA has likely bottomed since January 2024, and the recent lows earlier last month have validated yet another higher-low price structure, with the 20-week and 50-week moving averages both pointing favorably to a nascent uptrend recovery. Therefore, I might finally decide to pull the buy trigger after having demurring in the previous opportunity. BABA’s PEG ratio of 0.7 is more than 50% below its sector median. But let’s face it, [Chinese stocks are cheap for a reason,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-quants-rebound-on-stocks-rally-as-investors-woo-new-stars "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/china-quants-rebound-on-stocks-rally-as-investors-woo-new-stars") given the lack of buying confidence and liquidity, coupled with the heightened geopolitical risks that could hamper a longer-term view by investors as they might consider cashing in after a solid run.

Hence, I believe it’s still apt for me to turn more circumspect on BABA’s rating as we wait for the next better opportunity to add after the recent buying optimism subsides first. For me, I believe I may decide to go long on China’s resilient e-commerce and cloud computing leader at the next consolidation.

Rating: Downgrade to Hold.
