Rich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI, said that a breakout to an all-time high in the S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")), ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) and the Nasdaq 100 ([QQQM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQM "Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF")), ([QQQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ "Invesco QQQ ETF")) “is imminent.”

Ross said he expects a breakout above 6,130 for the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")), which is currently at 6,059, targeting an upside of 6,400-6,500 for the first half of the year.

In addition, he said that Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) has bottomed, the U.S. dollar ([DXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY "US Dollar Index")) and the 10-year yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) are peaking; copper ([HG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HG1:COM "Copper Futures")) is “streaking,” and crude oil ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) is “leaking.”

“–The sum of which suggests that a breakout to an all-time high in the S&P ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) and QQQ ([QQQM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQM "Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF")) is imminent,” he said.

He explained that Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) “and its IT accoutrements across AI” must be bought after bottoming its key support, “which has defined the bull trend for more than two years and 1,300%.”

Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) is down 1.44% year-to-date, but he sees the stock reaching $200.

When it comes to the U.S. dollar ([DXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY "US Dollar Index")), he sees it as a “high conviction sell,” as “you can bet your bottom dollar, that the dollar ([DXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY "US Dollar Index")) has peaked at $110.” The index is currently at $108.

In addition, the dollar against the Canadian dollar ([USD:CAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CAD "US Dollar / Canadian Dollar")), the Chinese yuan ([USD:CNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CNY "US Dollar / Chinese Yuan")), the Swedish krona ([USD:SEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:SEK "US Dollar / Swedish Krona")), and the Swiss franc ([USD:CHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CHF "US Dollar / Swiss Franc")) have all bottomed, and there is now “bullish risk.”

Also, the 10-year Treasury yield’s ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) target is 4.25-4.15, Ross said. “Yields have tracked the dollar with precision and will follow it lower, driving stocks higher.”

Crude oil ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) remains in a weak position “save a trader’s bounce off the 100-day moving average and strength should be sold.” He targets it at $65.

Lastly, copper ([HG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HG1:COM "Copper Futures")) has surged 16% year-to-date, compared to 1% for crude oil ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")), “as the dollar eases and yields peak after three years of tight policy finally relents.”
