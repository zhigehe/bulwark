Camtek Customer Base (Camtek Investor Relations)





Since the [last time](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4475001-camtek-rapid-growth-ahead-with-semiconductor-industry) I covered Camtek, the stock price has doubled, and I reiterate my strong buy rating. They have been growing, generating operating cash, developing new products, and expanding their customer base.

I expect them to continue their success because:

* Camtek's target markets (high-performance computing, AI, mobile, and automotives) are expecting to grow substantially, and Camtek will take full advantage.
* Camtek has been maintaining their technological advancement via strong R&D investment and acquisitions. Their new products are performing well in the market.
* Their profit margin has been increasing, and they have a strong balance sheet to support their profitable growth path.

### Camtek's Target Market Growth

High Performance Computing is the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and it is [expected to grow](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/high-performance-computing-market) at 8.1% CAGR until 2030.

High Performance Computing is based on chiplets and high-bandwidth memory, and this requires increasingly sophisticated manufacturing processes. The additional inspection steps and finer dimensions required to manufacture these semiconductors present a great opportunity for Camtek.

The chiplet package market is expected to grow at 36% CAGR until 2027, and high-bandwidth memory shipments are expected to grow at 22% CAGR until 2026.

Camtek already has a strong position in all tier-1 manufacturers (e.g., Samsung, TSMC, and SK Hynix), and the position will get stronger with the introduction of new products.

The [automotive industry](https://appinventiv.com/blog/benefits-of-semiconductor-technology-in-automotive/) is also a big driver for high performing semiconductor chips. The increased number of advanced features on vehicles, like motion sensors and smart-cameras, are driving growth in the autonomous chip market. This trend will continue well into the future.

The increasing number of electric vehicles and wireless connectivity will also benefit the automotive semiconductor segment.

[Yole Intelligence research](https://www.yolegroup.com/product/report/semiconductor-trends-in-automotive-2024/#:~:text=Semiconductor%20value%20per%20car%20reaching%20%241%2C000%20by%202029&text=Electrification%20and%20ADAS%20are%20driving%20significant%20growth%20in%20the%20automotive%20semiconductor%20market.&text=Power%20devices%3A%20The%20rise%20of,to%20efficiently%20manage%20power%20conversion.) suggests that there will be about $1,000 worth of semiconductors per car by 2029, and this will increase the size of the market to $100 B. Camtek is in a good position to take advantage of all this market growth.

### Technological edge

Semiconductor inspection equipment is used in many phases of the manufacturing process. The inspection [equipment detects](https://us.metoree.com/categories/semiconductor-inspection/) problems such as distortion, cracks, scratches, foreign matter on the photomasks and wafers, misalignment of circuit patterns in the front-end process, and dimensional and packaging defects in the back-end process.

To produce high-quality semiconductors in an efficient operation, manufacturers must have high-end semiconductor inspection equipment.

Camtek has many technologically advanced products that are differentiated, which is an essential for such a highly competitive technical fields.

Camtek's Eagle [is rated](https://averroes.ai/blog/semiconductor-inspection-equipment) by Averroes as the best inspection equipment for high-volume manufacturing and surface inspection. The strengths of the Eagle include its multimode imaging, automatic defect classification, and high throughput capability.

[Global Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/20/3012066/0/en/Semiconductor-Metrology-and-Inspection-Equipment-Market-to-Reach-USD-12-36-Billion-by-2032-at-a-CAGR-of-6-50-Research-by-SNS-Insider.html) expects that the Semiconductor Metrology and Inspection Equipment market will reach $12.36 B by 2023 (6.5% CAGG). There is large growth coming from the surge of 5G networks, and the report included Camtek as one of the leading market players in the area of inspection and metrology equipment for semiconductor packaging.

With market-leading products, Camtek will continue to be able to grow their revenue and profit, and the stock price will continue to follow its upward trend.

### Outstanding Profitability

Not only has Camtek been growing at an outstanding pace in the past several years, but they have been very profitable. Their profit margins like EBIT margin (24.41%), EBITDA margin (26.17%), and Net Income margin (26.53%) are substantially higher than the sector medians.

Compared against its peers (Amkor, Kulicke and Soffa, and Ultra Clean Holdings), Camtek's profit margins are higher.

This high profitability reflects the high quality of their products and its operational efficiency. As the company grows and produces more products, the margin will only improve.

The [operating margin has](https://camtek.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/Camtek_Investors_JAN25.pdf) grown substantially over the past several years (11% in 2017 to 26% in 2023), and management expects the gross margin and operating margin to reach 51-53% and 30-33%, respectively.

Progress to Target Model (Camtek Investor Relations)





### Earnings Review

Camtek [reported 4Q 2024 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407069-camtek-projects-q1-2025-revenues-of-118m-120m-amid-strong-hpc-demand) on Feb. 12th, and there were no surprises. It was an outstanding result. Full Year 2024 revenue reached $429 M, which represented 36% YOY growth, and 4Q 2024 revenues and operating income were $117.3 M and $36.3 M, respectively. Their EPS ($0.77) and revenue were both above the market estimates.

Management [mentioned](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757483-camtek-ltd-camt-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) that the primary growth engine for the next several years will be advanced packaging in high performance computing, and Camtek is strongly positioned to capture the growth. They expect the introduction of two new advanced systems (Eagle 5G and Hawk) will further improve their leadership position.

Knowing their strong products and efficient operations, it is not surprising to see great earnings yet again. I believe their products will continue to perform well and improve their market share, and the stork price will continue to follow the trend.

### Intrinsic Value Estimation

The assumptions of the intrinsic value estimation from [my previous article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4475001-camtek-rapid-growth-ahead-with-semiconductor-industry) are mostly unchanged. That is, apart from the fact that TTM EBITDA grew from $60 M to $105 M. I believe they will continue to grow at a rapid pace (40% EBITDA growth, 5-year average) for the foreseeable future. This is due to both company growth from their strong products and growth in the overall semiconductor market. I believe the current stock price represents an upside of 10-25%.

| Price Target | Upside |
| --- | --- |
| Base Case | $94.79 | 9% |
| Bullish Case | $111.17 | 28% |
| Bear Case | $80.49 | -8% |

The following data/assumptions were used for the price target estimation:

* WACC: 10.0%.
* EBITDA Growth Rate: 40% (base case), 45% (bullish case), and 35% (bear case).
* Current EBITDA: $105 M.
* Current stock price: $87.08 per share (02/12/2024).

### Risk

The geographic revenue concentration is one of the big concerns for Camtek. According to the [latest earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757483-camtek-ltd-camt-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) call, the revenue split was 92% in Asia and 8% the rest of the world. Therefore, an economic slowdown or geopolitical tensions in Asia can substantially impact Camtek. China [has been dealing](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/chinas-long-economic-slowdown/) with the real estate market slump and an overall economic slowdown. The government has been trying to boost the economy through various stimuli and policies, but it has not been effective yet. If the Chinese economy goes into a recession, Camtek's revenue growth will be negatively impacted.

Some of [Camtek's products](https://averroes.ai/blog/camtek-machine-vision-inspection) include the need for highly skilled personnel to operate the system. Their systems tend to need experts to calibrate and update them, instead of being beginner-friendly. Furthermore, their systems are considered pricier than those of competitors.

When the economy is good and market is growing, these won't pose problems. However, when the semiconductor industry experiences a lower growth and lower margin environment, semiconductor manufacturers may prefer cheaper alternatives to save on capital expenditure and operating cost.

Conclusion
----------

Camtek has been carving out a nice niche in the market and growing at a strong pace in the past several years. Looking at their product line up and newly released systems, I expect them to continue to perform well in the semiconductor inspection and metrology market.

The secular tailwinds from high performance computing market growth and automotive semiconductor business growth will greatly benefit Camtek.

The Asian concentration, high price tag, and higher skill level demands for the user do pose drawbacks, but I expect their highly differentiated technology will enable Camtek to overcome these challenges. I expect continued market expansion. I believe Camtek is a suitable option for a growth oriented investor.
