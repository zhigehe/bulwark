More Than a U.S. Relic: The A&W We Mean
---------------------------------------

If you think the 'Granddaddy of QSRs' is a regular limited-service restaurant chain, you're sorely mistaken. [Many credit](https://www.oldest.org/food/fast-food-chains/ "https://www.oldest.org/food/fast-food-chains/") A & W Food Services Of Canada (TSX:[AW:CA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AW:CA "A & W Food Services of Canada Inc.")) as the oldest limited-service restaurant chain in the world! It almost holds that title.

In fact, the oldest limited-service restaurant chain in the world is [Yoshinoya](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748484-yoshinoya-the-great-grandparent-of-qsrs-is-worth-monitoring "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748484-yoshinoya-the-great-grandparent-of-qsrs-is-worth-monitoring") ([OTCPK:YNOYF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YNOYF "Yoshinoya Holdings Co., Ltd.")), which began operating its gyudon restaurants in the late 19th century! But we can't say that A&W is far behind. [Roy Allen](https://awrestaurants.com/blog/it-all-started-roadside-stand-roots-aw-restaurants "https://awrestaurants.com/blog/it-all-started-roadside-stand-roots-aw-restaurants") was selling his beers on the side of the road even before the 1920s. They cost about five cents each (damn inflation!), and they started to become a big hit in the Lodi, CA area.

Credence got stuck in Lodi, but A&W took a different route. The following year, Allen partnered with Frank Wright, and they opened their first restaurant in the Sacramento area. It was a hit! They began franchising shortly after opening their operations. Ten years before the long-running Dairy Queen opened its doors, A&W already had a footprint of approximately 171 locations.

Twenty years later, the company's portfolio already had nearly ten thousand restaurants, with a footprint that encompassed territories such as Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Western Europe. It was around this time that A&W opened its first restaurant in Canada, more precisely in Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba. Note a crucial detail: in 1972, A&W's operations in Canada were sold, and to this day, they operate separately from their operations in the United States.

I know you're curious. Let me continue the story for now.

In the 1970s, A&W had a larger footprint than established chains like McDonald's ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")). It had 2,400 locations at its peak. However, nothing lasts forever. As the QSR environment became [increasingly competitive](https://www.whenitwascool.com/fast-explosion-of-the-1950s "https://www.whenitwascool.com/fast-explosion-of-the-1950s") after the 1960s, A&W ended up losing a huge amount of market share, which eventually translated into franchisees taking losses and closing restaurants. By the end of the 1970s, A&W had 1,300 locations! A 45% drop by the end of the decade.

After being sold twice, once in each of the next two decades, A&W fell into the hands of Yorkshire Global Restaurants. This was created by the merger of A&W with Long John Silver's, another limited-service restaurant chain that was not doing so well at the time. But this structure did not last long. At the dawn of the new millennium, Yorkshire was purchased by Tricon Global Restaurants, which soon became [Yum! Brands](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756567-yum-brands-taco-bell-keeps-winning-while-kfc-simmering-very-slowly "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756567-yum-brands-taco-bell-keeps-winning-while-kfc-simmering-very-slowly") ([YUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM "Yum! Brands, Inc.")). I knew that name sounded familiar, didn't I?

Yum! soon began testing multi-brand locations, and A&W was one of the ones chosen from its portfolio. There were more than fifty A&W/KFC locations spread throughout the United States. In fact, some of them still operate today from [KBP Foods](https://kbpbrands.com/ "https://kbpbrands.com/"), which still has multi-brand KFC/Long John Silver's and KFC/A&W locations in its portfolio today. This is the largest Yum! franchisee within the United States! Despite all the efforts, A&W seemed to be the 'Ugly Duckling' of the Yum! portfolio. [Sale](https://investors.yum.com/news-events/financial-releases/news-details/2011/Yum-Brands-Announces-Definitive-Agreements-to-Sell-Long-John-Silvers-and-AW-All-American-Restaurants-to-Key-Franchisee-Leaders/default.aspx "https://investors.yum.com/news-events/financial-releases/news-details/2011/Yum-Brands-Announces-Definitive-Agreements-to-Sell-Long-John-Silvers-and-AW-All-American-Restaurants-to-Key-Franchisee-Leaders/default.aspx") seemed the only option. Early last decade, a group of franchisees got together and created [Great American Brand LLC](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111223005049/en/Iconic-AW-Restaurants-Inc.-Acquired-by-A-Great-American-Brand-LLC-from-YUM%21-Brands-Inc.-Growth-Potential-Seen-for-92-Year-Old-Chain "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111223005049/en/Iconic-AW-Restaurants-Inc.-Acquired-by-A-Great-American-Brand-LLC-from-YUM%21-Brands-Inc.-Growth-Potential-Seen-for-92-Year-Old-Chain") and purchased the brand.

I hope I've satisfied your curiosity! Either way, A&W has had a much smoother path in Canuck Country. They currently have a [footprint](https://web.aw.ca/en/locations "https://web.aw.ca/en/locations") of approximately 1,062 restaurants, which makes A&W the 3rd largest restaurant chain in Canada, behind only [Tim Hortons](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734813-restaurant-brands-showing-why-theyre-international "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734813-restaurant-brands-showing-why-theyre-international") ([QSR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR "Restaurant Brands International Inc.")) and McDonald's. However, when we look at QSR Burger alone, A&W is the second-largest restaurant chain in the country, behind McDonald's, which has 1,466 locations!

Approximately 325 restaurants are located in Ontario, which is the largest concentration of its footprint. This is followed by Alberta, with 204 restaurants, and British Columbia, with 190 restaurants. Together, these three markets represent 67% of A&W Canada’s entire footprint. It is worth mentioning that since A&W began franchising its restaurants in 1923, the company has operated under an asset-light model. This has also continued over time and is the case with its restaurant portfolio in Canada. Almost all of its restaurants are franchised.

Once a Royalty Fund, Now a Traditional Restaurant Stock!
--------------------------------------------------------

No, you’re not crazy. A&W was actually a royalty fund that recently made a strategic transition to a traditional restaurant stock. The change happened in October, and I don’t blame you for not knowing about it. With the [merger](https://awincomefund.mediaroom.com/2024-10-17-A-W-Revenue-Royalties-Income-Fund-and-A-W-Food-Services-of-Canada-Announce-Successful-Closing-of-Combination-Transaction "https://awincomefund.mediaroom.com/2024-10-17-A-W-Revenue-Royalties-Income-Fund-and-A-W-Food-Services-of-Canada-Announce-Successful-Closing-of-Combination-Transaction") of A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (TSX:AW.UN) with A & W Food Services of Canada, A&W Food Services NewCo was created.

But before we understand how the transaction came about, we need to understand the practical consequences of this. Basically, the former A&W Revenue RIF functioned as a Royalty Fund, just like [Pizza Pizza Royalty](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741436-pizza-pizza-royalty-stock-dividend-margin-safety-great-passive-income-portfolio "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741436-pizza-pizza-royalty-stock-dividend-margin-safety-great-passive-income-portfolio") ([PZA:CA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PZA:CA "Pizza Pizza Royalty Corp.")) and [Boston Pizza RIF](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757136-boston-pizza-a-dividend-crust-thats-neither-too-thick-nor-too-thin "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757136-boston-pizza-a-dividend-crust-thats-neither-too-thick-nor-too-thin") ([OTC:BPZZF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPZZF "Boston Pizza Royalties Income Fund")). Restaurants participating in the Royalty Pool paid approximately 3% of their top-line sales, and these were the fund's revenues. In this way, shareholders did not participate in A&W's operating profits, since the growth in royalty distribution only depended on the number of restaurants within the Royalty Pool and the sales generated by them.

Note that this made the fund highly sensitive to interest rates, since it behaved like a fixed income security.

1. They have predictable revenue and, consequently, predictable cash flow to the shareholder;
2. Absence of participation in operating profits and a payout ratio close to 100%;
3. High sensitivity to interest rates, since payments were predictable and stable, making investors see them as an alternative to government bonds.

Also consider that under the previous structure, new restaurants were not automatically added to the Royalty Pool, but rather were added upon issuance of new shares to the former A&W Food Services. Note that this did not allow for the full benefit to shareholders from the addition of new restaurants, but rather was diluted with each new restaurant added.

In other words, since each new addition to the pool required some form of stock compensation to A&W FS, shareholders had limited benefits from increased footprint, but benefited fully from growth in sales at the same restaurants.

During the transaction, A&W RIF shareholders could either receive one share of A&W Services that they owned or receive $37 for each share they owned. This was a premium of approximately 30% over A&W RIF’s closing price in July! Many sold their shares, and I would do the same. We all know that most restaurant chains perform poorly after they go public. Now, in addition to being able to leverage and access capital for growth, shareholders will have greater liquidity and potential for appreciation. But perhaps the biggest benefit will be dividends, which will now be considered eligible in Canada and therefore will not be taxed as ordinary income.

A Look at the Financial Statements
----------------------------------

Unlike A&W in the U.S., things are going well over the border. Of course, the 'Fast-Food Exodus' is also occurring there, but it appears that A&W is not seeing these problems reflected in lower top-line sales.

We know these barriers aren't entirely insurmountable. Tim Hortons is seeing its same-store sales grow in the mid-single digits year over year by following a simple formula: great-tasting, affordable food, and a touch of menu innovation here and there.

Revenue grew 17.4% year-over-year during Q3 FY 2024, but appears to have stagnated at a level of nearly $300 million over the past three years, with FY 2024 promising low-single-digit year-over-year growth. This was driven by flat same-store sales and more spaced-out growth in new restaurants. Keep in mind that A&W operates under a franchise model, so we will see more contained growth in top-line sales.

This slightly more contained growth in revenues is also evidenced by the flat EBITDA and EBIT in the last twelve months compared to FY 2023. Note these movements in the graph below:

 [![Financial data and margins](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59215211-17393256297933695.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59215211-17393256297933695_origin.png) 



Financial data and margins (Author)



Note that the increase in top-line sales was not able to dilute fixed costs as it did in the post-pandemic period. This reduced margins by at least 200 basis points year over year. But that's not all. A&W had higher interest expenses, which were also not offset by higher EBIT. However, there was a sudden increase in receivables and A&W needed to safeguard itself in short-term debt to supply liquidity, as well as increase the payment term of its bills and increase other operating liability accounts.

Regarding its cash flow, we can see that it is typical of companies that work with an asset-light model. Its FCF is practically the same as its OCF, given the low need for investment. You can see this in the financial statements of other restaurant chains that work this way, such as Dine Brands ([DIN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIN "Dine Brands Global, Inc.")). A typical cash cow. A&W distributes the excess FCF through dividends after paying down its short-term debt. Here is a brief chart of the relationship between OCF and dividends paid:

 [![Dividend sustainability](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59215211-17393256303680875.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/11/59215211-17393256303680875_origin.png) 



Dividend sustainability (Author)



When we use only the OCF, we can conclude that the dividends seem unsustainable. However, we need to adjust the OCF with the capital coming from the company's investments. Remember, A&W also received dividends from restaurants sold to the Royalty Pool! Therefore, we need to take into account the capital obtained from investment activities. This makes it easier to see how they were passed on to A&W shareholders. With the merger of the two companies, we should see an increase in the OCF.

Putting the dots together, we have the following situation:

1. A&W has seen flat top-line sales over the past few fiscal years. You could look at the glass half empty and argue that at least it has protected itself from a revenue decline, given the bleak outlook for QSRs in America over the past three years. On the other hand, looking at the glass half full, you could argue that at least it hasn’t declined year over year. Regardless, franchised restaurants are facing a moderate decline in same-store sales and a slower pipeline;
2. Due to the deleveraging of sales and an increase in operating costs, margins are gradually falling; Balance sheet clean of long-term debt, but with liquidity issues due to its rising operating expenses. I would like to see A&W add some leverage to cover some of the holes in its balance sheet, which they will likely do after the merger;
3. Dividends are sustainable if we take into account ICF+OCF.

Valuation: To Take a Sip of Root Beer or Not?
---------------------------------------------

Just as we do with cash cow companies, I will take advantage of the dividends to try to find a suitable PT. Follow the thread:

* The projected EPS for FY 2025 is $2.22, according to the analyst consensus. Note that the dividend paid is expected to remain at $1.92 as specified in the A&W RIF merger documents;
* Considering a P/E of 17, about 15% lower than what Restaurant Brands International is trading at now, we have an exit price of approximately $37.74;
* Considering the dividend paid in FY 2025 plus the exit price and discounting to present value, we find a PT of approximately $36.89.

When we consider a P/E of 17x its projected earnings for FY 2025, we can say that the stock is close to being fairly valued. Of course, we cannot estimate that A&W will trade at 20x its earnings, in the same way as RBI. It is nearly impossible, since RBI has a much larger scale and a portfolio full of brands. Note that currently, A&W trades at a multiple of approximately 16x its projected earnings, which is relatively low compared to the industry median of 21x. But can we compare it to the industry median? I think it's best to stick to the 15x-19x earnings range for now.

Looking at the NPVGO, we also have an interesting scenario. Consider an EPS of $2.22 and a dividend per share of $1.92. This will give us a payout of approximately 86%. Now, notice that the retention is only $0.31! With a low single-digit ROA, which is of little importance to us here, the IGR will be less than 0.1%. The funny thing is that the stock will literally behave like a cash cow. The NPV of this retention, since it is small, will only reduce the value of the stock by $3.90. That is, the PT would be the price of the stock as if it were a cash cow ($29.60) minus the NPVGO (-$3.90). If we project the dividend to $1.98, in line with the full-year estimates, we have a PT of approximately $27.

There is no doubt that the stock is being priced based on the 10-year average dividend growth. Now, A&W RIF had a dividend growth rate of 2.3% per year. If we model this in perpetuity, we have a PT of $36.92, about 10% upside from where the stock is trading today. Remember that the 10-year average rate for the industry is about 1.5% per year, which gives A&W an advantage, but I don't see many catalysts for buying at this price.

That said, I see that when we project dividends forward, as we do in the SPDDM and Gordon Model, we still have some upside ahead, but it is not an opportunity at the moment. Now, if the fair price of the stock based on dividend growth is $36, buying it at $33 would hardly be called a bargain, would you agree?! I would really like to see a few things before I upgrade my rating here. They are:

1. Liquidity issues on the balance sheet being addressed, with management adding some long-term debt; and
2. New stores being added and same-store sales closing the gap between fast-casuals. A recovery is likely expected in Q4, who knows, we may not see it.

Sure, if you believe in perpetual dividend growth of 3% year over year, then you would have an upside of 27%! But that would imply dividend growth that is twice as high as the industry median. But I don't really believe in that.
