Crude oil futures edged higher Friday but fell for a third consecutive week, as the market grappled with complications from President Trump's postponed tariffs on oil from Canada and Mexico, Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. oil and gas, new sanctions on an international network facilitating the shipment of Iranian crude to China, OPEC+ maintaining its plan to start raising production in April, and a bigger than expected buildup in U.S. crude oil inventories.

"The imposition of tariffs and the pauses should be bullish for the oil market because it adds uncertainty, but you haven't seen this response because of demand concerns," Societe General global head of commodities research Michael Haigh [said](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-set-third-straight-weekly-drop-tariff-fears-2025-02-07/ "said"). "Tariffs and tit-for-tat responses from nations, it hurts global GDP... and oil demand."

On Friday, afternoon, Trump said he would announce reciprocal tariffs next week, as he remains "the biggest influence on oil prices, no doubt," Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn [said](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250207256/crude-falls-for-the-week-as-trumps-historic-moves-write-the-script-for-oil-in-the-short-term "said"). "The president will keep us guessing, from tariffs on to tariffs off," but these "historic moves are going to write the script for oil in the short term."

U.S. WTI's drop toward $70/bbl on Thursday sparked "strong dip-buying" interest in early trading Friday, Swissquote Bank's Ipek Ozkardeskaya said, but uncertainty over tariff moves threaten to "hammer global growth prospects and will probably support a deeper retreat in crude prices," with a fall toward the $65-$68 range now looking plausible.

A larger than expected leap in weekly U.S. crude supplies also contributed to oil's losses this week, as commercial inventories climbed by 8.7M barrels for the week ending January 31.

Front-month Nymex crude ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) for March delivery finished -2.1% to $71.00/bbl this week, its second lowest settlement value YTD, while front-month April Brent crude ([CO1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM "Brent Futures")) closed -1.3% to $74.66/bbl for the week, the third consecutive weekly decline for both benchmarks; on Friday, WTI settled up 0.6% and Brent rose 0.5%.

U.S. natural gas futures fell on Friday while posting a weekly gain, as weather forecasts show colder temperatures appearing after a mild first week of February; front-month March Nymex natural gas ([NG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NG1:COM "Natural Gas Futures")) ended +8.7% to $3.309/MMBtu on the week, while falling 2.9% on Friday.

Trump said Friday that the U.S. and Japan are [discussing a pipeline project in Alaska](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/02/07/trump-says-he-discussed-lng-exports-with-japans-ishiba/ "discussing a pipeline project in Alaska") after meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, and that Japan would begin importing new shipments of American liquefied natural gas "in record numbers."

Trump provided no specifics about the project, but he has been urged to encourage investment in the proposed $44B Alaska Gasline Development Corp. export project, which would open new markets for massive gas reserves now stranded at Alaska's North Slope.
