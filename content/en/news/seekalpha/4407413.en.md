Earnings Call Insights: Vishay Precision Group, Inc. (NYSE:[VPG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VPG "Vishay Precision Group, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ziv Shoshani emphasized that fiscal 2024 was challenging due to macroeconomic and cyclical headwinds, with revenue reaching $306.5 million. However, Q4 bookings showed a sequential growth of 5.5%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0, marking the first positive ratio in eight quarters.
* Sensors segment bookings increased by 7% sequentially, driven by demand for precision resistors in semiconductor back-end equipment and avionics. Meanwhile, Weighing Solutions bookings rose 14.5% due to higher demand in industrial weighing and medical applications.
* The integration of Nokra, acquired in Q3, is on track. Shoshani projected Nokra's 2025 revenue at $6 million, leveraging KELK's brand and sales channels.
* Shoshani highlighted a key business development project with a humanoid robot developer, which generated $1.5 million in prototype revenue and is now entering the preproduction phase. This project is expected to yield millions annually within two to three years. Additional partnerships with other humanoid robotic developers are also underway.
* CFO William Clancy reported Q4 revenue of $72.7 million and highlighted adjusted gross margin at 38.3%, impacted by unfavorable product mix and one-time material adjustments. Adjusted EPS for Q4 stood at $0.03.

### Outlook

* Management provided Q1 2025 revenue guidance of $70 million to $76 million.
* Business development initiatives are projected to contribute $30 million in revenue for 2025, with a cumulative goal of $100 million over three to four years.
* Efficiency initiatives for 2025 are expected to yield a minimum of $5 million in annual cost reductions, supported by manufacturing consolidation and automation, particularly at the India facility.

### Financial Results

* Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $5.1 million, representing 7% of revenue, down sequentially from 10.7% in Q3. Adjusted free cash flow improved to $4.6 million from negative $2.3 million in the prior quarter, driven by a $4 million reduction in inventory.
