*Update 7.51 AM EST: Adds revenue guidance*

With its Q4 2024 results on Tuesday, Humana (NYSE:[HUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUM "Humana Inc.")) warned that its annual Medicare Advantage membership could decline approximately ~10% in 2025 from the prior year following a decision to exit several loss-making markets and counties.

Humana (NYSE:[HUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUM "Humana Inc.")), the second-largest MA insurer after UnitedHealthcare of UnitedHealth ([UNH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated")), has faced multiple headwinds in that market segment, including a decline in its Medicare Star Ratings and worsening medical expenses.

However, the company reiterated its full-year outlook for 2025, implying roughly $16.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which stood almost unchanged from 2024 but fell short of $16.91 [per share in the consensus.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406005-humana-reports-mixed-q4-results-initiates-fy25-outlook)

Meanwhile, the prepared management remarks published on Humana’s website ahead of the company’s conference call indicated $126B-$128B of revenue forecast for 2025, well ahead of the $118.9B [projected by analysts.](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUM/earnings/estimates)

“We were pleased with Humana’s solid finish to the year while also reaffirming our outlook for 2025,” CEO Jim Rechtin remarked.

As for Q4 financials, the Louisville, Kentucky-based managed care firm reported $29.2B in revenue for the quarter with ~10% YoY growth ahead of Street forecasts, while its annual revenue reached $117.8B with ~11% YoY growth.

However, its bottom line on an adjusted basis fell short of consensus, reaching $2.16 of net loss per share compared to -$0.11 in the prior year period, while its full-year earnings indicated a ~42% YoY slump to $16.21 per share.

HUM's benefit ratio, which indicates the share of premiums paid out for medical expenses, grew 50 bps to 91.9% on an adjusted basis, including a 20 bps hike [attributed to Star Ratings investments.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19997666-humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides-full-year-2025-financial#hasComeFromMpArticle=false)
