OpenAI plans to release its latest large language model, ChatGPT-4.5, within the next few weeks, with GPT-5 launching within the next several months.

"We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model," said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a [post](https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244 "post") on X.

"After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks," Altman added. "In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3."

OpenAI plans to integrate existing models into GPT-5, including the o3, as it will no longer be shipped as a standalone model. The free tier of ChatGPT will offer unlimited chat access to GPT-5 when it is released. However, paying subscribers of the Plus and Pro plans will be able to utilize GPT-5 with voice, canvas, search and deep research.
