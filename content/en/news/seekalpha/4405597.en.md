OpenAI plans to complete designs for its first in-house semiconductors for powering artificial intelligence before the end of the year, and is reportedly working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:[TSM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited")) to make it happen.

The San Francisco-based creator of ChatGPT might finalize the design for its first line of chips within the next few months before sending the plans to TSM for fabrication, according to a report by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-set-finalize-first-custom-chip-design-this-year-2025-02-10/ "Reuters"), citing people familiar with the issue. OpenAI plans to begin mass production of its chips in 2026. The chips are expected to utilize TSM's advanced 3-nanometer process technology, and will help the startup reduce its dependency on Nvidia (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), which is the clear market leader in providing AI hardware.

In October 2024, reports surfaced that OpenAI had scrapped its global foundry goals, and was instead [partnering](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4219765-openai-partners-with-broadcom-to-build-ai-chips-report "partnering") with Broadcom (NASDAQ:[AVGO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO "Broadcom Inc.")) and TSM to design its own chips.

In the meantime, OpenAI will continue to power its AI ambitions through chips by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")).

On Sunday, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/global-affairs/introducing-the-intelligence-age/ "OpenAI") aired its first-ever television ad during the Super Bowl, as the startup pursues the creation of Artificial General Intelligence.
