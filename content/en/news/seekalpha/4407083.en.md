Iron Mountain (NYSE:[IRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM "Iron Mountain Incorporated")) is scheduled to announce Q4 earnings results on Thursday, February 13th, before market open.

The consensus FFO estimate is $0.86 (+3.61% Y/Y) and the consensus revenue estimate is $1.60B (+12.75% Y/Y).

**Last Quarter**

Iron Mountain's [Q3 adjusted FFO per share](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4252072-iron-mountain) of $1.13, beating the Visible Alpha consensus of $1.11, rose from $1.08 in Q2 and $1.02 in last year's Q3.

Total revenue of $1.56B, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.55B, grew from $1.53B in the prior quarter and $1.39B a year ago.

The rise in Q3 revenue [was attributed](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19905188-iron-mountain-reports-third-quarter-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false) to an about 9% increase in storage rental revenue and ~17% higher service revenue.

The AFFO outperformance was driven by [higher adjusted EBITDA](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4733728-iron-mountain-incorporated-irm-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript), which in turn was attributed to an increase in revenue in Global RIM, ALM, and data center.

The provider of document storage services and data centers operator had said it expects to reach the high end of its prior 2024 guidance, which stands at adjusted FFO per share of $4.39-$4.51 vs. the Visible Alpha consensus of $4.48, revenue of $6.00B-$6.15B vs. the $6.14B consensus.

**DeepSeek Impact**

"Recent DeepSeek news places some uncertainty on future trajectory of AI training capex / hyperscale demand, although we don't expect much NT (near-term) impact. We would tilt more positively toward (1) IRM and (2) EQIX into Q4 and more cautiously on DLR," said Wells Fargo Equity Research.

Wells Fargo expects a de-risked data center outlook, with 80% of the 2025 revenue growth locked in from pre-leases; revenue acceleration in data centers, asset life-cycle management, and digital solution; and a steady ~6% RIM storage revenue growth.

The things that pose a threat in the near-term include foreign exchange impact, cost of capital, any moderation in pricing actions at RIM storage, lack of clarity on component pricing outlook for ALM, and any potential impact from the current trade war in China, the note said.

**Ratings**

The [Wall Street community](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM/ratings/sell-side-ratings) grades the stock as a Buy, with a B+ for Growth and A for Momentum.

[Seeking Alpha authors](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM/ratings/author-ratings) and the [Quant Rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM/ratings/quant-ratings) system rate IRM as Hold.

"IRM is set to report increased data center leasing over the next few quarters, significantly aided by the recent acquisition & the eventual capacity growth to over 1.2 GW (+30%)," [said](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748968-iron-mountains-warranted-correction-triggers-a-richer-return-profile-ahead) SA contributor Juxtaposed Ideas.

The stock has added 49.51% of value in the last one year.
