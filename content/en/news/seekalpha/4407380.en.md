Earnings Call Insights: Rexel S.A. ([OTCPK:RXLSF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RXLSF "Rexel S.A.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Guillaume Texier highlighted Rexel's resilience during a challenging 2024, achieving a 5.9% adjusted EBITA margin despite a 2.4% decline in same-day sales. He attributed this to effective cost-saving measures and structural optimizations.
* Texier emphasized market share gains in key geographies, particularly in France, and the benefits of their strategic focus on North America, where Q4 sales grew 3.6%.
* CFO Laurent Delabarre reported Q4 revenues of €4.9 billion, supported by acquisitions like Talley in the U.S. and Itesa in France, which added 2.1% to growth. The company also divested its New Zealand operations, signaling a focus on optimizing its portfolio.

### Outlook

* Management provided cautious guidance for 2025, projecting stable to slightly positive same-day sales growth and targeting a profitability margin of around 6%.
* Texier noted favorable conditions in North America, driven by industrial and residential growth, while Europe is expected to recover more gradually, with improvements anticipated in the second half of 2025.
* The company expects a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 65%, excluding the €124 million French Antitrust Authority fine scheduled for payment in 2025.
* Electrification trends remain subdued, but management highlighted long-term growth drivers such as reshoring, sustainability, and increased demand for electrical products in developed markets.

### Financial Results

* Full-year 2024 revenues reached €19.3 billion, with an adjusted EBITA margin of 5.9%, reflecting pressures from inflation, pricing dynamics, and deflationary trends in solar and HVAC markets.
* Free cash flow before interest and tax totaled €917 million, translating to a record 76% cash conversion rate, exceeding mid-term guidance.
* North America delivered a 3.6% sales increase in Q4, led by growth in nonresidential and industrial segments, while Europe experienced a 3.8% decline, with resilience in France and the Nordics offset by challenges in DACH and Benelux regions.
* Net debt rose to €2.5 billion due to acquisitions, dividend payments, and share repurchases.

### Q&A

* Martin Wilkie, Citi: Asked about the potential impact of tariffs. Texier stated that tariffs could provide inflationary benefits to gross margins, as seen in previous cycles.
* Alexander Virgo, Bank of America: Queried about electrification trends and residential market recovery. Texier noted green shoots in industrial automation and anticipated a mechanical recovery in residential markets following interest rate reductions.
* Daniela Costa, Goldman Sachs: Questioned the modest margin guidance. Texier explained that OpEx inflation, projected north of 2%, remains a key headwind.
* Akash Gupta, JPMorgan: Sought clarity on pricing trends. Delabarre projected slight inflation in traditional products for 2025 and stabilization in deflationary segments like solar panels.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed concerns over the conservative margin guidance and slow recovery in European markets. Questions reflected skepticism about electrification momentum and competitive pressures.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing structural improvements and market share gains, but their responses during the Q&A were more defensive, particularly on inflation and pricing dynamics.
* Compared to prior discussions, management appeared more cautious, reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties and ongoing cost pressures.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* No prior quarter comparison is available, but North America demonstrated sequential improvement, while Europe showed signs of stabilization in Q4.
* Analysts continued to focus on pricing challenges and margin pressures, while management reiterated its emphasis on cost-saving initiatives and portfolio optimization.
* Strategic priorities remained centered on leveraging market share gains, accelerating digital adoption, and enhancing operational efficiencies.

### Risks and Concerns

* Economic uncertainties in Europe, including slow growth and political instability, pose risks to recovery.
* Inflationary pressures on operational expenses and competitive pricing dynamics remain significant headwinds.
* Analysts questioned the pace of electrification recovery and the limited margin expansion despite ongoing structural initiatives.

### Final Takeaway

Rexel enters 2025 with a balanced outlook, supported by strong cost-saving measures, market share gains, and momentum in North America. While Europe continues to face challenges, management remains focused on structural improvements, digital adoption, and portfolio optimization to meet mid-term targets, including a 6% profitability margin and stable free cash flow conversion.
