Four Democratic U.S. Senators asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Office of the Inspector General to conduct a review to determine whether the regulator's acting chairman's reported decision to rescind more than 200 job offers to bank examiners threatens the banking system's stability.

In a letter to the FDIC's Office of the Inspector General, the senators — Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) — pointed out that the FDIC OIG had previously concluded that staffing shortages was one of two causes that delayed supervisory activities relating to Signature Bank's failure in March 2023. "The lesson learned in this case was that a shortage of cops on the beat can threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system and pose risks to the Deposit Insurance Fund," the lawmakers wrote.

"Given the implications this decision may have on the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system and the risk it may pose to the Deposit Insurance Fund, an evaluation by your office would be consistent with your mission to “promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness at the Agency," the senators [said.](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fdic_bank_examiner_letter.pdf "said.")
