Bank of Canada officials decided to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3% last month to better balance inflation risks, and support the economy in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threat as "the adverse impact on the level of GDP would be permanent."

The policymakers agreed that U.S. tariffs "would weigh on business confidence and investment intentions, as well as consumer sentiment," according to minutes of the monetary policy meeting released on Wednesday.

While there has been some pick up in economic activity, with inflation around 2%, Bank of Canada warned that a protracted trade conflict would lead to weaker GDP and higher prices. The impact would be greater for Canada than the U.S.

"Even if no tariffs were imposed, a long period of uncertainty under the cloud of tariff threats would almost certainly damage business investment in Canada," the minutes stated, as companies are already re-evaluating their investment plans, raising the risk of capital flight from the country to the U.S.

A trade war would slow global growth, which Bank of Canada officials said would reduce energy demand and potentially lower oil prices. "This would tend to lower inflation, but it would also reduce incomes in Canada, given the country's large energy export sector," according to the [minutes](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/02/summary-governing-council-deliberations-fixed-announcement-date-january-29-2025/ "minutes").

Earlier this month, Trump had announced 25% tariffs on most Canadian goods and 10% duties on energy imports. He later put the tariffs on hold till March 4 after Canada agreed to reinforce border security.
