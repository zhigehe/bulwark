W.P. Carey (NYSE:[WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")) stock slipped 1.1% in Tuesday after-hours trading after the net lease REIT issued conservative 2025 guidance to hedge against interest rate and macroeconomic uncertainties.

The net lease REIT expects [2025 AFFO per share of $4.82-$4.92](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999025-w-p-carey-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results "2025 AFFO per share of $4.82-$4.92") (midpoint $4.87), vs. the $4.88 consensus. Investment volume is anticipated to be $1.0B-$1.5B, and disposition volume is estimated to be $500M-$1.5B.

"Given the uncertainty in the broader market, however, particularly over the direction of interest rates and other macroeconomic factors, our guidance reflects a measured approach, which we hope proves conservative as the year progresses," said CEO Jason Fox.

Q4 adjusted FFO per share of $1.21, vs. the average analyst estimate of $1.19, rose from $1.18 in Q3 and $1.19 in Q4 2023.

Q4 revenue of $406.2M, beating the $404.3M consensus, increased from $397.4M in the previous quarter and dropped from $412.4M a year ago.

Lease revenue climbed to $351.4M from $334.0M in Q3 and $336.8M in Q4 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily doe to net investment activity and rent escalations, as well as outstanding rents collected in connection with a disposition during the current-year period.

Operating expenses of $221.9M grew from $194.2M in the prior quarter and declined from $283M a year ago.

W.P. Carey's (NYSE:[WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")) net lease portfolio generated contractual same-store annual rent growth of 2.6% on a constant-currency basis in Q4, compared with 2.8% in Q3.
