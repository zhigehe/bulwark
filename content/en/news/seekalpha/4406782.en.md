* Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[INO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INO "Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) Wednesday said that peer-reviewed data from its Phase 1/2 clinical trial with INO-3107 as a potential treatment for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis were published online in Nature Communications.
* Data shows that INO-3107 induced new populations of T cells in the blood that traveled to airway tissue and were associated with clinical benefit as measured by reduced need for surgeries.
* Of the 32 patients in the trial, 26 patients (81%) required fewer surgeries post-treatment when compared to the year prior to treatment. INO-3107 treatment was also well tolerated in the trial.
* Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:[INO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INO "Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")) plans to submit its biologics license application for INO-3107 in mid-2025 and request rolling submission and priority review under the FDA's accelerated approval program.
* If approved, INO-3107 would be the first DNA medicine approved for any indication in the United States.
