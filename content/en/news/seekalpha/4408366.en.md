Asia-Pacific markets mixed on Friday following the rally on Wall Street Thursday after US President Donald Trump delayed implementing reciprocal tariffs and hopes of easing the trade war following the Modi-Trump talks capped the falls.

The market sentiment remained cautious following the People's Bank of China's latest policy signals.

Japan ([NKY:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKY:IND "NIKKEI 225 Index")) fell 0.85% to around 39,300 on Friday, ending a three-day rally as the yen sharply rebounded overnight. The [Japanese yen](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:JPY#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews) traded around 153 per dollar on Friday after surging about 1% in the previous session.

The investors continued to navigate Japan's busy earnings season, which has yielded mixed results so far.

Meanwhile, Japan’s Economy Minister, Ryosei Akazawa, stated on Friday that Japan would respond appropriately to any US reciprocal tariffs.

China ([SHCOMP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHCOMP "SHANGHAI Index")) rose 0.04% to around 3,337, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.9% to 10,720 on Friday, recovering from losses in the previous session after the People’s Bank of China pledged to support the economy with loose monetary policy. The [offshore yuan](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD:CNY) weakened around 7.29 per dollar, giving back gains from the previous session.

The central bank also forecast stable economic growth for China in 2025, as stimulus measures implemented last year begin to revive production, demand, and market sentiment.

The central bank pledged to ease monetary policy when appropriate to support economic growth, emphasizing liquidity management and targeted measures to stabilize the financial system.

Hong Kong ([HSI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSI "Hang Seng Index")) rose 2.12% to 22,196 in Friday's morning session, recovering from slight losses in the previous session amid broad sector gains.

India ([SENSEX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SENSEX "SENSEX Index")) fell 0.58% to 75,832, touching their nearly three-week low in early deals on Friday, after being flat in the previous session. Almost all sectors traded in the red, led by pharmaceuticals.

Total passenger vehicle sales in India grew 3.5% year-over-year to 351,310 units in January 2025, following an 11.4% jump in the previous month, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

Australia ([AS51](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AS51)) rose 0.19% to around 8,590 on Friday, reaching fresh all-time highs. The [Australian dollar](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUD:USD) rose above $0.632 on Friday, approaching two-month highs.

In the U.S., on Thursday, [all three major indexes ended higher](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407820-nasdaq-sp-rise-as-investors-juggle-economic-data-earnings-ahead-of-tariff-announcement "all three major indexes ended higher") after President Trump sparked hopes about resolving the Ukraine conflict and delayed a decision on imposing additional tariffs on imported goods.

Meanwhile, the latest producer inflation report came in hotter-than-expected, following strong consumer inflation data the day before. However, the components suggest that the core PCE inflation, which the Fed favors, will likely come in lower than anticipated later this month.

U.S. stock futures remained steady on Friday after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum to review reciprocal tariffs but postponed taking immediate action, while hinting at possible auto tariffs: Dow +0.04%; S&P 500 +0.09%; Nasdaq +0.04%.

Additionally, market participants awaited US retail sales data on Friday to assess the strength of the economy.
