Abstract Aerial Art





Dominion Energy (NYSE:[D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")) reported [earnings on Wednesday](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406755-dominion-energy-reports-mixed-q4-results-narrows-fy25-outlook-reaffirms-long-term-guidance), with its non-GAP EPS at $0.58, $0.03 above expectations, while its sales fell 3.7% YoY to $3.4B. The company offered more specific 2025 guidance, targeting an operating EPS of $3.28 to $3.52 per share, not changing the mean target. More importantly, it emphasized long-term operating earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2029.

This growth is expected to be fueled by $50B in capital investments over the next four years into the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, with other investments aimed at positioning the company to benefit from increased data center power demand in Northern Virginia. [The report was](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407114-dominion-energy-projects-50b-capital-investment-through-2029-with-5-percentminus-7-percent) altogether mixed, with some market participants disappointed in its lackluster sales and others concerned by potentially higher costs on the CVOW project and lower support from the new administration.

Dominion trades at a notable discount to the most prominent older utility giants. Its dividend yield is around 1.4% higher than the mean of NextEra ([NEE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEE "NextEra Energy, Inc.")), Southern ([SO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SO "The Southern Company")), and Duke ([DUK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK "Duke Energy Corporation")). Its forward "EV/EBITDA" is also about 1.4X lower. Despite that, its long-term EPS growth outlook is about twice that of its peer group mean at 14.2% compared to 7.1%. See below:

Those three companies are more prominent, and NextEra's valuation is particularly outstretched. However, NextEra's high valuation partly stems from its environmental power supply efforts. Though Dominion is pursuing similar aims and has a notably higher EPS growth expectation, it trades at a notable discount, not a premium. With this in mind, and in light of the new administration, I believe it is an opportune time to dig into Dominion's risk-reward profile to determine if this discount remains reasonable.

Offshore Wind Must Prove Itself in 2025
---------------------------------------

CVOW has been a point of contention for Dominion over recent years. In early 2023, I had a [bearish outlook on Dominion](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570507-dominion-energy-stock-dividend-pressures-expected-amid-high-cost-projects) because I expected this project to be costly and deliver questionable energy production results. Dominion remains 10% lower than when I published that view but was down around 33% by October 2023. I upgraded my view to neutral that summer due [to its low valuation](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4627923-dominion-energy-fairly-valued-after-losing-valuation-premium). I maintained that [view in May 2024](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4690961-dominion-energy-offshore-wind-gamble-may-pay-off-better-than-expected), seeing that the offshore wind project reportedly developed on time and budget. Finally, I upgraded my view to bullish in November, following its correction post-election, under the [view that data center demand](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738075-dominion-energy-growth-at-reasonable-price-opportunity-data-power-demand-rises) would drive well-above-average growth over the coming years.

2025 is proving to be a critical year for the company. The utility giant reported that the CVOW project is around "50% complete" and remains on track and on time for a 2025 completion. Despite concerns, the company did not change guidance on CVOW, but reiterated this is its "all of the above" energy supply strategy, shifting its tone away from the ESG focus seen during much of the past four years. Although the project is "50% complete," it is unclear what that means, as it appears more complete with planning and laying groundwork than actual construction, where the budget and timeline are at higher risk of skew. See below:

[![Dominion's "50% complete" project implies it is just now starting large-scale construction](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/49544530-17394608697671556.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/13/49544530-17394608697671556_origin.png)



Dominion Energy CVOW Project Timeline (Dominion Q4 Investor Presentation)





For Dominion, 2025 is the year of the "monopiles," large steel cylinders installed on the seafloor. The keyword I see is "steel," given [Trump is pursuing 25%](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c360dz384n5o) tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports without exceptions. The company addressed concern on this point, [stating](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757520-dominion-energy-inc-d-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript):

> It's really too early to say how potential tariffs might affect this project. I can tell you that remaining spend outside of the United States is about $2.5 billion, a majority of that from Europe, only a portion of that for components that would include steel or aluminum. With respect to potential steel and aluminum tariffs in particular, generally these types of tariffs are not intended to apply to most finished products. We would consider the CVOW components to be finished products. That said, we don't have the annexes to accompany the executive order.

In short, the company expects that if the tariffs are similar to 2018, it will not be impacted; however, it remains unclear if that is true. At this point, I do not see this as a significant risk factor until we know with certainty if finished products will face tariffs. Regardless, because most of its non-US spending is from the EU, Dominion faces risk if EU tariffs are extended more [broadly, as indicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zgx808g7o). 

CVOW cost overruns are a notable risk to Dominion. Per [its SCC agreement](https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/regulators-approve-offshore-wind-settlement/#:~:text=Most%20significantly%2C%20the%20agreement%20outlines,how%20costs%20should%20be%20recovered.), if costs rise over $10.3B, the company will pick up half of the cost and 100% if that figure rises to $13.7B. Dominion does not face risk if the project does not produce sufficient power. Today, its cost estimate has increased by $900M to $10.7B, meaning Dominion now faces risk if [the project's cost grows](https://www.wavy.com/news/business/dominion-energy-customers-to-help-pay-900m-cost-increase-of-virginia-wind-farm/#:~:text=Posted:%20Feb%204%2C%202025%20/,project%20spared%20from%20Trump's%20pause). Tariffs, [Virginia's skilled construction](https://virginiabusiness.com/construction-firms-expect-mixed-bag-for-2024-survey-says/) labor shortages, and the general rebound in inflation all threaten to push that cost estimate higher.

CVOW may be "50% complete" on its timeline, but it is just starting large-scale construction. For this reason, and in light of recent inflationary trends, I downgrade my outlook on the project and see more risk that Dominion could see CVOW's budget rise to $13.7B or higher.

Crucially, its "Charybdis" vessel, used for this project, is 96% complete, meaning we will get a more precise determination of this project's efficacy throughout the year, creating a risk-reward opportunity for the company. Dominion expects the vessel to be delivered in Q3, with initial trials early this year. This vessel has cost $715M, far above original cost estimates of $500M, with delivery later than the initial 2023 target. This is one significant indication that, as Dominion pursues actual construction, it is at risk of cost and time overruns.

Further, with the Trump admin backing away from offshore wind, the long-term value of this costly vessel is likely compromised. Initially, it was intended for long-term use on other utilities' offshore projects, potentially offering a revenue stream to Dominion, but that is unlikely for now. More alarmingly, the Trump administration has stated it will review previously issued proposals for Dominion's CVOW project, [following a day-one executive order](https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-offshore-wind-dominion) that the Justice Department should conduct a "review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases for such removal.‚Äù Thus, there is an outstanding threat that this project could be shuttered, leaving Dominion with legally vague but likely notable risks.

The Bottom Line
---------------

In light of renewed inflationary pressures, cost and time overruns on aspects of CVOW, and a complete reversal in government support for offshore wind, I downgrade my outlook on D to neutral. Further, despite the talk of investment in [small-scale nuclear projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/dominion-is-discussing-small-nuclear-reactors-with-other-tech-companies.html) for data centers, there was limited managerial discussion of nuclear in its last call. It is clear that the company is still looking toward nuclear investments, but it offers limited concrete guidance on these projects, which should take years to develop.

In short, not to say anything about the overall efficiency of Trump's administration's policies, it has become clear that they're a net negative for Dominion, mainly because it's not necessarily investing in a project that aligns with the administration's goals.

I am neutral on Dominion because I doubt its growth outlook due to these changes, reversing my previous opinions. Further, if CVOW's costs continue to rise, it may face a few billion dollars in liabilities, mainly if costs are significantly higher than projected. Given that construction will ramp up this year, I expect we will see a clearer picture regarding cost overruns around Q2 or Q3. If it avoids them, I may return to a bullish outlook.

Dominion's valuation offers a slight discount, giving it a great long-term profile if it can manage 7%+ EPS growth over the coming years. In light of recent events, I see an increased risk that its growth investments will fail to pay off.
