### Management View

* CEO Bob Blue emphasized the company's continued commitment to strategic simplicity, consistent financial execution, and a focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. He highlighted accomplishments including achieving operating earnings at the top half of guidance, significant progress on the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, and constructive regulatory outcomes in multiple states.
* CFO Steven Ridge reported Q4 2024 operating earnings of $0.58 per share, reaching the top half of the guidance range despite weather headwinds. Full-year 2024 operating earnings totaled $2.77 per share, while GAAP earnings were $2.44 per share.
* Ridge announced a narrowed 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $3.28 to $3.52 per share, maintaining a midpoint of $3.40, and reaffirmed the annual operating earnings growth guidance of 5%-7% through 2029, excluding RNG 45Z credits.
* Ridge disclosed an updated five-year capital investment forecast of $50 billion, representing a 16% increase from previous guidance, with 80% of the increase allocated to Dominion Energy Virginia and 60% of the spending eligible for recovery under rider mechanisms.
* CEO Blue provided updates on the CVOW project, which is 50% complete and on schedule for 2026 completion. He noted the cost estimate has increased to $10.7 billion, largely due to higher network upgrade costs, but stated that robust cost-sharing mechanisms protect customers and shareholders.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed the 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $3.28 to $3.52 per share and an annual earnings growth rate of 5%-7% through 2029.
* The updated capital investment forecast focuses on incremental investments across distribution, transmission, and generation to meet growing energy demand, particularly driven by rapid data center growth in Virginia.
* The company expects to maintain its annual dividend at $2.67 per share until achieving a utility-aligned payout ratio.
* Ridge indicated confidence in delivering the CVOW project on the updated timeline and cost estimate, asserting that additional cost revisions, if any, would not be of similar magnitude.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 operating earnings were reported at $0.58 per share, compared to analysts' estimate of $0.55. Full-year operating earnings totaled $2.77 per share, exceeding weather-adjusted expectations.

### Q&A
