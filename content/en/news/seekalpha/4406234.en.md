Bernstein launched its coverage of Biogen (NASDAQ:[BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")) on Tuesday with a Market Perform recommendation ahead of its Q4 earnings release this week, citing a difficult sales trajectory for the company’s Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi developed with Eisai ([OTCPK:ESALF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESALF "Eisai Co., Ltd.")).

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company, which is set to release its Q4 2024 financials before the market opens on Wednesday, has struggled to meet the lofty expectations set for its anti-amyloid agent since its initial approval by the FDA in 2023 for adults with early Alzheimer’s.

When its peak sales were cut by 40% last year, Biogen (NASDAQ:[BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")) shares lost a similar percentage, Bernstein analysts argued.

While the DCF valuation indicates an undervalued stock, Bernstein thinks that BIIB is valued on a near-term growth outlook, which will remain hazy as the company is unlikely to witness a notable infection in its narrative or the Leqembi launch until at least 2026.

If Novo Nordisk’s ([NVO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO "Novo Nordisk A/S")) GLP-1 weight loss therapy semaglutide succeeds in its Phase 3 AD study for Alzheimer’s, there will be added pressure on Biogen (NASDAQ:[BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")), the analysts wrote with a $160 per share target on the stock.
