Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) workers at a warehouse in North Carolina will decide this week if they should unionize. If successful, this would be the second Amazon warehouse to unionize, following the Staten Island facility.

The North Carolina workers will vote on whether they want to be represented by the Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment. The vote began on Monday, and will end on Saturday.

The facility employs over 4,700 people, with pay starting at $18.50 per hour, according to Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")). C.A.U.S.E. is advocating for higher pay ($30/hour), longer breaks, improved benefits, and better working conditions.

"We've always said that we want our employees to have their voices heard, and we hope and expect this process allows for that," an Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) spokesperson said regarding the North Carolina vote. "We believe our employees favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team."

The e-commerce giant has repeatedly pushed back against unionization efforts, even going to court to challenge such efforts. Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) warehouse employees went [on strike](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4389274-holiday-check-amazon-says-its-business-as-usual-despite-teamsters-strike-at-seven-facilities "on strike") in December during the busy holiday shopping season over the company's refusal to negotiate with unionized workers.

"If we win, we'll become the first unionized Amazon facility in the South," C.A.U.S.E. president Ryan Brown [said](https://inequality.org/article/the-first-amazon-union-in-the-south/ "said") of the North Carolina vote. "Coming off historic holiday strikes at Amazon facilities around the country and the first Whole Foods union victory since Amazon bought it, we have the momentum."

Employees at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia voted to unionize last month. But last week, the Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc."))-owned grocery chain asked the National Labor Relations Board to overturn the vote after the Trump administration fired two board members, leaving only two sitting board [members](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/the-board "members").

The NLRB shakeup has been viewed as positive for companies like Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) and Elon Musk's SpaceX ([SPACE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPACE "SpaceX")) that have challenged the constitutionality of the board.
