The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles, hoping to become the first team to win three Super Bowls in a row. The Eagles are looking to take home their second Vince Lombardi trophy.

When it comes to the market, the Super Bowl Indicator suggests that stocks will outperform if the NFC team wins. But things change when Philly is involved.

**Super Bowl Indicator** 

Leonard Koppett, a sportswriter for The New York Times, introduced the Super Bowl Indicator in 1978. He discovered a correlation between the outcome of the Super Bowl and market movements, which had never been wrong until that point.

According to [data](https://www.carsongroup.com/insights/blog/welcome-to-the-worst-month-of-the-year-in-a-post-election-year-and-why-american-doesnt-want-the-eagles-to-win/) compiled by the Carson Group, the S&P 500 ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500 "S&P 500 Index")) rose 10% during the full year when an NFC team won, compared to an 8.1% gain when the AFC team won. The AFC and NFC have each won 29 Super Bowls.

But before you start rooting for the Eagles, Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at the Carson Group, [notes](https://x.com/RyanDetrick/status/1887160788353483122) "very bad things happen when the City of Brotherly Love wins a Super Bowl or World Series."
