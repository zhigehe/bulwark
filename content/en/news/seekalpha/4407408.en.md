Earnings Call Insights: PodcastOne (NASDAQ:[PODC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PODC "PodcastOne, Inc.")) Q3 2024

### Management View

* Kit Gray, Co-Founder and President, highlighted PodcastOne's strategic initiatives during the quarter, including the partnership with Amazon's ART19. He emphasized that this collaboration provides immediate financial benefits, including a minimum guaranteed revenue of $15 million over three years, operational efficiencies, advanced analytics, and new revenue channels.
* The company signed Stassi Schroeder to a multi-year seven-figure deal, reinforcing its focus on expanding female-focused content. Gray noted the potential for live shows and merchandising tied to this collaboration.
* The newly launched PodcastOne Pro service and Beverly Hills production studio are being utilized by major brands like Boost Mobile and Microsoft, offering customizable production solutions and driving additional revenue streams.
* CFO Aaron Sullivan stated, "Revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2025 increased 22% to $12.7 million compared to $10.4 million in the same year ago quarter." He further highlighted that the company ended the quarter with no debt and $0.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, attributing the improved operating loss to lower non-cash stock compensation expenses.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed fiscal 2025 revenue guidance of at least $51 million, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. Positive adjusted EBITDA is also projected for the full fiscal year.
* Gray noted that the ART19 partnership is expected to contribute to revenue growth starting in fiscal Q4 2025, with further scaling anticipated over the next few quarters.
* Additional revenue growth is expected from diversified streams, including PodcastOne Pro, merchandising, and live events.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for Q3 2024 totaled $12.7 million, a 22% increase compared to $10.4 million in the same quarter last year.
* Operating loss improved to $1.6 million from $2.6 million in the previous year’s quarter, driven by cost controls and reduced stock compensation expenses.
* Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $0.7 million, impacted by the timing of content acquisition costs.
* Net loss for the quarter was $1.6 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.11 per share, in the same year-ago quarter.

### Q&A

* Sean McGowan, ROTH Capital Partners: "What drives the timing of content acquisition costs impacting Q3?" Aaron Sullivan explained that certain revenue deals expected in Q3 moved to Q4, while minimum guarantees were paid to talent in Q3, creating a timing mismatch.
