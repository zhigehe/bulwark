Investment Thesis
-----------------

Since my [last bullish coverage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720197-exxonmobils-expansion-plans-you-cant-ignore "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720197-exxonmobils-expansion-plans-you-cant-ignore"), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:[XOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM "Exxon Mobil Corporation")) has remained muted, but its fundamentals have strengthened, leading me to increase my position. XOM is set for 50% production growth by 2030, with Permian output rising from 1.5M to 2.3M barrels/day and Guyana reaching 650K barrels/day, supported by $3B in annual synergies from the Pioneer deal. Despite market volatility, Exxon posted $34B in earnings and $55B in cash flow in 2024, with a 15% five-year average ROCE, reflecting strong capital efficiency. If valuation multiples revert to historical highs, XOM could see a ~43% upside, reinforcing its position as a key winner in the next energy cycle, and I remain bullish.

Operational Strength Signals 50% Production Growth and ~43% Upside Potential in the Stock
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exxon Mobil’s operational edge in 2024 is pointed out by its lead in reliability and environmental stewardship that sustains its business growth. For instance, the company has [hit a +60% reduction](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript") in methane intensity since 2016. This reduction is a reflection of Exxon’s focus on reducing its carbon footprint, which can lead to cost savings through improved regulatory compliance. The company’s business reliability metrics also hit a record. Reliability in operations is vital for minimizing downtime and maximizing output that directly impacts top- and bottom-line. For instance, in the Permian Basin, Exxon hit record production from both its Heritage ExxonMobil assets and its newly integrated Pioneer assets. The combined production from these assets may grow from 1.5M oil-equivalent barrels per day in CY24 to 2.3M barrels per day by CY30. This represents an increase of over 50%. This growth trajectory is supported by synergies estimated at more than $3 billion annually.

In Guyana, Exxon’s operational success is equally notable. The company has gone from discovery to producing 650K barrels per day in just 10 years in deepwater projects. This rapid expansion is a reflection of Exxon’s technical strength and capability to execute large-scale projects to completion. The economic effects in Guyana have been significant, with GDP per capita having more than tripled since 2020, when production began. This relationship between Exxon’s operational edge and the economic development of host countries may boost the company’s social license to operate.

Moreover, Exxon Mobil’s performance in CY24 highlights its ability to derive strong earnings and cash flow, even in adverse macros. The company had earnings of [$34B (its third-highest result in a decade).](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript") Over the past five years, Exxon has grown its earnings (excluding identified items) at a compounded annual growth of ~30%. This constant growth in earnings emerged from a disciplined approach to capital allocation and its focus on high-return projects. Cash from operations hit $55B in 2024, which is also the third-highest in a decade. Excluding working capital, the company’s free cash flow is more than enough to cover distributions, which indicates a strong balance sheet.

The company’s return on capital employed [(ROCE) was 13% in CY24](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_10c87de99617c8513375a28b79d5bf64/exxonmobil/db/2288/22354/earnings_release/4Q24+Earnings+Press+Release+Website.pdf "https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_10c87de99617c8513375a28b79d5bf64/exxonmobil/db/2288/22354/earnings_release/4Q24+Earnings+Press+Release+Website.pdf"), with a five-year average of 11%. When adjusted for cash balances and projects under construction, the 2024 ROCE rises to ~17% with a five-year average of ~15%. This points to Exxon’s capability to derive returns above its cost of capital that derive good equity value. Also, Exxon Mobil’s US growth strategy is directly attached to the policy and regulatory environment. The company has allocated ~90% of its planned CapEx through 2030 to established, fully functioning markets for energy and products that require no policy support. Only ~10% of its CapEx is earmarked for lower-emissions markets, where market forces have yet to fully take hold. All in all, this move ensures that Exxon can have profitable growth amid the energy transition.

For instance, the company’s Baytown low-carbon hydrogen project is requiring incentives [under Section 45B of the Inflation Reduction Act](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript") to be economically viable. These incentives are vital to establishing a fully market-based space where hydrogen can directly compete with traditional fuels. However, the company’s stance that energy sources should not be artificially discouraged (as was the case with the Biden administration’s moratorium on new LNG export facilities and its executive order capping offshore drilling) is favorable for its business and top-line.

Overall, considering internal fundamentals and the “[Drill Baby Drill, Faster!](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/ "https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/")” macro, Exxon Mobil’s top line seems progressive moving forward. However, consensus estimates are not positive for the company’s top line. This creates a value opportunity as the PS ratio (TTM) is slightly above the long-term average (10Y) and has the possibility to hit a new high, as it did in the first Trump presidency (2016-2020). If the ratio moves toward the historical high, the stock has to deliver a 43% upside price move, as the top line may not see much downside.

Growth Hinges on Project Execution, $3B Synergy Target, and 2030 Production Goals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the downside, Exxon Mobil’s growth strategy heavily relies on the sharp execution of its major projects. These are particularly in Guyana and the Permian Basin. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties in these projects that would hinder the expansion of the company. For instance, the [Yellowtail project in Guyana may start up in Q3-25](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753943-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript") with the potential to come in slightly ahead of schedule. While this optimism is encouraging for the stock, the long-term capacity and utilization of the Guyana asset remain uncertain. Why? Projecting capacity versus utilization far into the long term is complex due to numerous variables (like reservoir management, depletion curves, and infill drilling). The company’s estimate of moving from 10 reservoirs to ~40 by 2030 introduces massive complexity, and any missteps or delays in managing these reservoirs could lead to suboptimal production levels, earnings, and cash flow misses, then stock price drops.

Moreover, the company’s reliance on tech advancements like the next-generation cube design and patented lightweight proppant in the Permian introduces execution risks. These technologies may improve resource recovery and reduce emissions intensity, but their real-world performance remains to be fully validated. Any delays or failures in implementing these advanced technologies could result in higher costs and lower production volumes. The Permian Basin, which is expected to grow production from 0.8M (2.3M-1.5M) oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2030, is a vital component of Exxon’s growth. However, achieving this growth target depends on the up-to-the-mark integration of Pioneer assets and the realization of synergies estimated at over $3B annually. Any delays or cost overruns in these synergies could negatively impact the company’s financials.

Finally, the chemicals market has been a weak spot for Exxon, with margins consistently [below the 10-Year average](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_10c87de99617c8513375a28b79d5bf64/exxonmobil/db/2288/22354/presentation/4Q24+Earnings+Slides+-+Final.pdf "https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_10c87de99617c8513375a28b79d5bf64/exxonmobil/db/2288/22354/presentation/4Q24+Earnings+Slides+-+Final.pdf"). Despite record levels of demand, the oversupply in the chemicals market has kept margins depressed. Woods mentioned in the earnings call that the industry needs to go through cycles to high-grade the overall portfolio. However, this process could take time, and Exxon’s chemical business may continue to face headwinds in the near term. Although Exxon has a diversified business model, weak performance in one segment can offset gains in others.

Takeaway
--------

XOM is poised for a major production surge, with 50% growth by 2030, driven by record output in Guyana and the Permian Basin. Strong cash flow, a 15% ROCE, and $3B in annual synergies reinforce its financial resilience. Despite the muted stock performance, valuation multiples suggest a ~43% upside, making XOM a **top energy cycle winner.** With improving fundamentals and a bullish long-term outlook, I remain bullish.
