Earnings Call Insights: LXP Industrial Trust (NYSE:[LXP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LXP "LXP Industrial Trust")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* The CEO highlighted favorable leasing activity in Q4 2024, including nearly 1 million square feet leased, driving strong rental increases of 66% on a base rent basis and 43% on a cash basis, excluding fixed rate renewals. Full-year same-store NOI grew by 5%.
* The company completed the sale of its remaining consolidated office assets and other properties, reallocating proceeds to acquisitions of Class A Sunbelt properties and a build-to-suit facility. Four industrial facilities were acquired for $158 million at an average 6% initial yield.
* The CEO emphasized proactive steps to reduce leverage, achieving a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.9x by year-end, down from 6.1x in Q3 2024, and locking in fixed rates on 97% of its debt through 2026.
* The CFO confirmed Q4 adjusted company FFO was $0.16 per diluted share, contributing to a full-year 2024 adjusted company FFO of $0.64 per share. Same-store NOI growth reached 4.1% in the quarter, with leasing escalators averaging 2.8% annually.
* Leasing achievements included a 29% cash rental increase in a Columbus lease renewal and a 59% cash rental increase in a Phoenix lease renewal post-quarter.

### Outlook

* The company issued 2025 adjusted company FFO guidance of $0.61 to $0.65 per diluted share. The low end assumes no leasing of big-box properties, while the high end assumes all three are leased in the second half of 2025.
* Management expects 2025 same-store NOI growth in the range of 3% to 4%, with further leasing activity anticipated to support growth.
* The company remains cautiously optimistic about industrial market fundamentals in the Sunbelt and Lower Midwest, which have shown resilience compared to coastal markets.

### Financial Results

* Total gross revenues for Q4 2024 were approximately $101 million, including $15 million from a sales-type lease. Property operating expenses were $15 million, with 89% reimbursed by tenants.
* The company reported consolidated debt of $1.6 billion at year-end, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.68% and a term to maturity of 5.5 years. Subsequent to year-end, $50 million of term loan debt was repaid.
* Same-store portfolio occupancy stood at 99.5% at year-end.

### Q&A

James Dudley noted increased tenant interest in January and described active prospects across all large vacancies. Brendan Mullinix estimated stabilization yields for larger buildings at 6%.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Leasing activity improved significantly in Q4, with nearly 1 million square feet leased versus 490,000 square feet in Q3 2024. Mark-to-market rental increases also accelerated.
* Debt leverage decreased from 6.1x in Q3 to 5.9x in Q4, reflecting stronger financial positioning.
* Analysts focused more on leasing headwinds and interest expense in Q4 compared to Q3, where questions were more balanced across leasing and acquisitions.
