Investment environment
----------------------

* The U.S. fixed income market posted a negative quarterly return, with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returning -3.06%. Credit spread sectors outperformed U.S. Treasuries.
* The U.S. economy remained resilient, as gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter of 2024 came in at 2.8% and the unemployment rate held steady around 4.1%. While Treasury markets sold off, risk markets reacted favorably to the decisive Republican Party victory in the November election, due to expectations for expansionary fiscal policies and deregulation.
* However, after starting the rate-cutting cycle with a 50- basis-point (BPs) cut in September, the Federal Reserve (Fed) took a decidedly more hawkish tone at its December meeting, with the revised Fed dot plot implying just 50 bps of rate cuts in 2025. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury ended the quarter at 4.57% relative to 3.78% at the end of September.
* Investors weighed the expected positive economic implications of the incoming administration with the slower anticipated pace of rate cuts. Corporate investment-grade credit spreads tightened 9 bps to 80 bps, while high-yield spreads tightened 8 bps to 287 bps.

Portfolio review
----------------

Our overweight allocation to spread risk contributed to relative performance. Spread sectors contributed to relative results on the back of relatively healthy economic data and positive investor sentiment following the outcome of the November election.

The key contributors included overweight allocations to non-agency mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), as well as an underweight to U.S. Treasuries. Security selection within investment-grade corporates also contributed. Our overweight allocations to agency MBS and conventional 30-year fixed mortgages detracted on a relative basis.

We trimmed our overall spread risk allocation – primarily via a reduction in investment-grade corporates, which are trading at richer valuations relative to other sectors – as spreads tightened during the quarter. Loan exposure increased, as did our exposure to securitized sectors by way of higher allocations to CMBS, agency MBS, and collateralized loan obligations.

Within our interest rate risk exposure, we entered the quarter with a modest duration overweight, which detracted as Treasury yields rose. We added duration as yields moved higher and have continued to favor an overweight to duration, as we believe the market may be pricing in too few rate cuts in 2025. Additionally, the Fed is in a good position to cut rates more aggressively if the economy weakens more than expected. We have continued to favor the short end of the yield curve where we expect these yields are most likely to fall on the back of rate cuts.

The portfolio remains well diversified with exposure to an array of fixed income sectors, while still maintaining a bias to higher credit quality. We believe this diversification is key to harvesting the attractive yields on offer in fixed income markets.

Manager outlook
---------------

As we enter 2025, we believe investors should seek to take advantage of three positive drivers impacting fixed income markets: the strong U.S. economy, the Fed having initiated its rate-cutting cycle, and the likely normalization of rate-spread correlations due to lower inflation.

Regarding the U.S. economy, corporates and consumers remain largely resilient. While corporate spreads are tight, we believe that strong fundamentals – including the favorable macroeconomic environment and reasonable leverage levels – will continue to support these valuations. Additionally, securitized sectors have continued to trade cheaply relative to corporates, offering attractive yields and the potential for spread tightening.

Furthermore, now that the Fed has begun its rate-cutting cycle and rates markets have priced in a slower pace of cuts, we believe bond investors may lean into the yields on offer and be less concerned with fighting rising rates. Even if inflation proves to be stickier due to the incoming administration’s economic policies, we think much of this risk is already priced in.

Real-time data indicates that inflation has continued to moderate toward the central bank’s target of 2%, and we believe that a resurgence of inflation above 3% is unlikely. Rates and spreads historically have been negatively correlated when inflation is below 3% – resulting in reduced portfolio volatility, as any material widening in credit spreads may be somewhat counterbalanced by falling rates.

Overall, we favor an overweight to credit spread risk amid the strong fundamental and technical backdrop, and an overweight to duration risk due to expectations for further rate cuts and a re-steepening of the yield curve. The market is currently pricing in a terminal rate around 4%, which is notably higher than the Fed’s estimate of 3.1%. We think the actual terminal rate will settle at a level below 4%, but we also expect the Fed’s estimate to move higher.

We believe it is important for investors to maximize income per unit of risk and limit drawdown risks in the present environment. In our view, the current market is more of a “carry” and bond pickers market, where investors are rewarded by clipping relatively high coupons and picking individual bonds with positively skewed risk-return expectations, as opposed to making macro bets.

Moreover, we think allocating to sectors that are trading at cheaper relative valuations – such as loans over high yield, or collateralized loan obligations and asset-backed securities over corporates – will be key in 2025. There likely will be continued noise and volatility around the new administration’s policies on deregulation, taxes, tariffs, and immigration, which we believe may create alpha opportunities for nimble, active investment managers.

Duration measures a bond price’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The longer a bond’s duration, the higher its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and vice versa. A yield curve plots the yields (interest rate) of bonds with equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. Typically bonds with longer maturities have higher yields.  Credit spread is the difference in yield between securities with similar maturity but different credit quality. Widening spreads generally indicate deteriorating creditworthiness of corporate borrowers, and narrowing indicate improving.  Securitized products, such as mortgage- and asset-backed securities, are more sensitive to interest rate changes, have extension and prepayment risk, and are subject to more credit, valuation, and liquidity risk than other fixed income securities.  10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds that will mature 10 years from the date of purchase.  Quantitative tightening (QT) is a government monetary policy occasionally used to decrease the money supply by either selling government securities or letting them mature and removing them from its cash balances.  Monetary Policy refers to the policies of a central bank, aimed at influencing the level of inflation and growth in an economy. It includes controlling interest rates and the supply of money. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Correlation measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. A value of 1.0 implies movement in parallel, -1.0 implies movement in opposite directions, and 0.0 implies no relationship.  Volatility measures risk using the dispersion of returns for a given investment.  Please consider the charges, risks, expenses and investment objectives carefully before investing.

Performance attribution is a method used to analyze and quantify the performance of an investment portfolio relative to its benchmark and does not represent actual performance. Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion.  **There** **is** **no** **assurance** **the** **stated** **objective(s)** **will** **be** **met.**  **Investing** **involves** **risk,** **including** **the** **possible** **loss** **of** **principal** **and** **fluctuation** **of** **value.**  **Fixed income securities** are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. The bond market is volatile. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. The return of principal is not guaranteed, and prices may decline if an issuer fails to make timely payments or its credit strength weakens.  **High-yield** **or** **"junk"** **bonds** involve a greater risk of default and price volatility and can experience sudden and sharp price swings.  **Derivatives** can be more volatile and sensitive to economic or market changes than other investments, which could result in losses exceeding the original investment and magnified by leverage.  **Short** **sales** are speculative transactions with potentially unlimited losses, and the use of leverage can magnify the effect of losses.  **ESG Integration.** As part of its investment process, portfolio management considers ESG risks and opportunities (“ESG Factors”) that it believes are financially material, alongside other fundamental investment factors. Examples of potential financially material ESG Factors include corporate governance, company culture, exposure to climate change, human capital management. To assess ESG Factors, portfolio management uses issuer reports, third-party data, and internally-generated analyses and may engage directly with issuers. ESG Factors are one of many considerations in the investment decision-making process and may not be determinative in deciding to include or exclude an investment from the portfolio.  **ESG Integration Risk.** There is a risk that considering ESG Factors as part of a Fund’s investment process may fail to produce the intended results or that each Fund may perform differently from funds that have a similar investment style but do not formally incorporate such considerations in their strategy. Information related to ESG Factors provided by issuers and third parties, upon which portfolio management may utilize, continues to develop, and may be incomplete, inaccurate, use different methodologies or be applied differently across issuers and industries. **Increased** **portfolio** **turnover** may result in higher expenses and potentially higher net taxable gains or losses.  **Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index** is a broad-based measure of the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. Index performance does not reflect the expenses of managing a portfolio as an index is unmanaged and not available for direct investment.
