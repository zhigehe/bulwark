Earnings Call Insights: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:[GILD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GILD "Gilead Sciences, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Daniel O'Day highlighted strong Q4 results with total product sales, excluding Veklury, growing 13% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Full-year sales reached $26.8 billion, driven by robust performance across HIV, oncology, and liver disease portfolios.
* HIV sales grew 8% year-over-year to $19.6 billion in 2024, exceeding expectations. Biktarvy delivered 13% growth, achieving over 50% U.S. market share, while Descovy maintained more than 40% market share in PrEP despite competition.
* Lenacapavir was filed for U.S. approval for twice-yearly HIV prevention. A mid-2025 launch is anticipated, with access expected to reach 75% within six months. European submissions are under accelerated review timelines.
* Livdelzi achieved $30 million in sales during its first full quarter post-launch, highlighting strong demand in primary biliary cholangitis treatment. European regulatory decisions are expected soon.
* CFO Andrew Dickinson noted, "We expect R&D to remain flat from 2024, and SG&A expenses are forecasted to decline by a high-single digit percentage in 2025."

### Outlook

* Gilead projects 2025 total product sales of $28.2 billion to $28.6 billion, with $26.8 billion to $27.2 billion excluding Veklury. Lenacapavir is expected to contribute meaningfully following its mid-year launch.
* Management indicated that 2025 HIV revenue will be impacted by approximately $1.1 billion from Medicare Part D reform, resulting in flat HIV revenue compared to 2024. However, underlying demand-led volume growth is expected to remain strong.
* First-quarter 2025 HIV revenue is expected to decline mid-teen percentage sequentially due to seasonal inventory drawdown, Medicare changes, and deductible resets.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 product sales, including Veklury, were $7.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.90 compared to $1.72 in the prior year.
* HIV sales grew 16% year-over-year in Q4 to $5.5 billion, driven by strong demand, higher average realized prices, and inventory dynamics. Biktarvy and Descovy both achieved 21% year-over-year growth.
* Oncology sales increased 12% year-over-year to $3.3 billion in 2024, with Trodelvy contributing $355 million in Q4 sales, up 19% year-over-year.
* Livdelzi's initial sales of $30 million exceeded internal expectations, reflecting strong adoption and payer access. Full-year liver disease sales reached $3 billion, up 9% year-over-year.
* The company maintained a gross margin of approximately 87% in Q4 2024, supported by a favorable product mix.

### Q&A

* Geoff Meacham, Citigroup: Asked if lenacapavir treatment options would replace Biktarvy before its LOE. Johanna Mercier explained that long-acting options will complement the portfolio, potentially impacting Biktarvy shares ahead of its 2033 LOE.
* Terrence Flynn, Morgan Stanley: Inquired about lenacapavir's inclusion in 2025 guidance. CFO Andrew Dickinson confirmed assumptions for a mid-year launch, with gradual access expansion and highlighted expense discipline.
* Tim Anderson, Bank of America: Asked about lenacapavir's ramp dynamics. Management outlined expected access ramping up to 75% by six months and 90% by 12 months post-launch.
* Michael Yee, Jefferies: Questioned FDA and European approval timelines for lenacapavir. O'Day confirmed all regulatory interactions are progressing on track for a summer 2025 launch.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts focused on lenacapavir's growth potential, HIV portfolio resilience, and Medicare reform impacts. Questions reflected optimism but cautious expectations around ramp dynamics.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing portfolio strength, regulatory progress, and disciplined expense management. Statements like "we feel incredibly confident" highlighted optimism for lenacapavir's launch.
* Compared to Q3, analysts' tone reflected greater emphasis on headwinds in HIV revenue from Medicare reforms and lenacapavir’s launch ramp.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Sequentially, Q4 HIV revenue grew 7%, reflecting strong demand and favorable inventory dynamics. This follows a 7% sequential increase in Q3.
* Management shifted focus to lenacapavir's potential and Medicare reforms in Q4, compared to Q3's emphasis on Livdelzi's early launch momentum.
* Analysts’ questions in Q4 centered more on regulatory timelines and competitive dynamics, compared to Q3’s focus on operational performance.

### Risks and Concerns

* Medicare Part D reforms are expected to reduce 2025 revenue by $1.1 billion, including $900 million in HIV.
* Competitive headwinds in CAR-T therapies, particularly from new launches and bi-specifics, remain a challenge.
* Analysts voiced concerns about lenacapavir's adoption curve and payer coverage, especially in underserved populations.

### Final Takeaway

Gilead Sciences delivered strong 2024 results, driven by robust HIV and oncology performance. The anticipated mid-2025 launch of lenacapavir positions the company for growth despite headwinds from Medicare reforms. Management remains focused on disciplined expense control, portfolio expansion, and executing on its regulatory and commercial milestones.
