Earnings Call Insights: American Well Corporation (NYSE:[AMWL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMWL "American Well Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Ido Schoenberg highlighted the completion of transformative efforts in 2024, including a strategic focus on the company's core mission and the refinement of its unified technology-enabled care platform. He emphasized the company's progress toward achieving cash flow positivity by 2026, supported by cost reduction measures and improved revenue quality.
* Schoenberg noted the staged deployment of the Military Health System (DHA) program, describing it as the largest growth initiative in the company's history. Full deployment across the AMHS enterprise is expected by early Q3 2025.
* The company divested its Amwell Psychiatric Care business to focus on its core platform, adding up to $30 million in cash to the balance sheet. Additionally, Amwell signed a partnership with Vida Health, integrating obesity and diabetes care solutions, including GLP-1 therapies, into its platform.
* CFO Mark Hirschhorn reported a 36% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue to $37 million in Q4, noting strategic client deployments as the primary driver. He also emphasized significant cost reductions across R&D, sales, and marketing.
* Hirschhorn revealed that the company's average annual contract values ([ACV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACV "Virtus AllianzGI Diversified Income & Convertible Fund")) for health plans and health systems grew to $963,000 and $488,000, respectively, reflecting the success of its "land-and-expand" strategy.

### Outlook

* Management provided 2025 revenue guidance in the range of $250 million to $260 million, excluding $25 million from the divested APC business. Subscription revenue is expected to represent nearly 60% of total revenue.
* Adjusted EBITDA for 2025 is projected between negative $55 million and negative $45 million, reflecting a 60% year-over-year improvement.
* Revenue for Q1 2025 is anticipated between $59 million and $61 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from negative $18 million to negative $20 million. Management noted that DHA-related revenue will significantly contribute to the company's financial performance in 2025.

### Financial Results

* Total revenue for Q4 2024 was $71 million, flat compared to Q4 2023. Subscription revenue reached $37 million, up 36% year-over-year, driven by DHA program rollouts.
* Visit revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $29.2 million, with total visits decreasing 18%. Average revenue per visit increased to $77, reflecting a shift toward higher-value virtual primary care and specialty programs.
* Gross profit margin improved to 48%, compared to 37% in Q4 2023, attributed to the growth in subscription revenue.
* Operating expenses saw significant reductions, particularly in R&D and sales and marketing costs, while G&A expenses rose due to a one-time bad debt accrual linked to a cybersecurity event.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2024 improved to negative $22.8 million from negative $36.9 million in Q4 2023.

### Q&A

* Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley: Asked about DHA deployment progress and growth expectations for 2025. CEO Schoenberg stated that the DHA rollout is proceeding as planned, with full enterprise deployment expected this year. He highlighted the growing quality of the company's pipeline, focusing on higher-margin software components.
* Stan Berenshteyn, Wells Fargo Securities: Inquired about the timing of the DHA sustainment contract. Schoenberg indicated that a three-year extension is likely, given the project's progress and positive feedback.
* Jailendra Singh, Truist Securities: Raised concerns about the company's long-term topline growth. Schoenberg emphasized the importance of subscription revenue growth and the increasing demand for technology-enabled care platforms.
* Charles Rhyee, TD Cowen: Questioned revenue contribution from DHA and the impact of visit revenue declines. CFO Hirschhorn clarified that DHA will contribute substantially in 2025, with reduced churn expected in the visit business.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, frequently seeking updates on DHA deployment and its financial impact. Questions reflected concerns about topline growth and visit revenue softness but acknowledged the progress in subscription revenue and cost reductions.

### Final Takeaway
