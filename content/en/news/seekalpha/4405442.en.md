China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports have gone into effect, just as U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans to impose [new 25% tariffs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405425-trump-says-he-will-impose-25-tariffs-on-all-steel-aluminum-imports-reports "new 25% tariffs") on all steel and aluminum imports, marking the next leg of the global trade war.

Trump said he'd announce reciprocal tariffs on "every country" on Tuesday or Wednesday. "It won't affect everybody, because there are some where we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the U.S., we're going to have a reciprocity," he declared.

Beijing last week announced tariffs on U.S. imports ranging from coal to agricultural equipment - soon after U.S. President Donald Trump's 10% duties on Chinese products went into effect. Beijing also announced [other retaliatory measures](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404160-china-wto-complaint-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-move "other measures"), but these were seen as largely symbolic.

Trump also scrapped the "de minimis" exemption that allowed duty-free shipping of low-cost packages, targeting Chinese e-commerce retailers that benefited the most from this loophole. However, the order was [paused](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/amendment-to-duties-addressing-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china/ "paused") indefinitely to give time for federal agencies to figure out how to process millions of such shipments.

But the 10% tariffs on Chinese goods entering the U.S. remain. As a deal between Beijing and Washington isn't likely any time soon, traders are weighing what could happen next.

"The move toward a more protectionist economy isn't temporary - it's a structural shift," Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, noted. "The past decades rewarded companies that optimized for cost efficiency in a globalized world. The next era will reward those that optimize for resilience, domestic production, and geopolitical stability."
