With gross gaming revenue (“GGR”) disappointing, and U.S. trade policy potentially impacting travel to the Chinese-controlled island, Citigroup analyst George Choi has turned more cautious towards Melco Resorts (NASDAQ:[MLCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLCO "Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited")) and downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, trimming his price target by 40% to $6.

While Melco Resorts (NASDAQ:[MLCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLCO "Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited")) is one of the more “aggressive operators” on cost-cutting, with no new product offerings in its flagship property “City of Dreams,” the company is likely to become a market share donor this year in light of new offerings by its competitors.

The downgrade to Melco (NASDAQ:[MLCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLCO "Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited")) is also supported by the outlook in Macau gaming. The region produced lower-than-expected GGR of Macanese pataca or MOP589M per day in January 2025 and just MOP900M a day for the first five days in February, suggesting the current run-rate (Jan and Feb combined) will be the second consecutive negative GGR data point.

Additionally, the implementation of U.S. tariffs against China beginning Feb 1 has dampened gaming demand towards the end of the Chinese golden week, with this negative impact likely to continue throughout most of the first half of this year.

Player sentiment will begin to recover in the second half of the year, Choi says, as the impact from the tariffs is digested and as major events return to Macau into the summer holidays and Chinese National Day Golden Week. Accordingly. Citi conservatively trims its GGR forecast in the second half of this year by ~2% to MOP119.5B.

To reflect his lowered Macau GGR forecasts, Choi also lowers EBITDA estimates for MGM China by ~13%, Sands China by 9-10%, Wynn Macau by 8%, MLCO by 6%, and Galaxy by 5%.

Shares of Melco Resorts & Entertainment ([MLCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLCO "Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited")) are down more than 5%, weighing on shares of MGM Resorts ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")), Las Vegas Sands ([LVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVS "Las Vegas Sands Corp.")), and Wynn Resorts ([WYNN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNN "Wynn Resorts, Limited")), all of which operate casinos in Macau.
