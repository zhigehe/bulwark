### Management View

* CEO Olivier Pomel highlighted Q4 2024 revenue of $738 million, a 25% year-over-year increase, exceeding the high end of the guidance range. Key customer metrics included 30,000 total customers and 3,610 customers with annual recurring revenue ([ARR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARR "ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.")) of $100,000 or more.
* Datadog crossed $3 billion in total ARR, primarily driven by infrastructure monitoring, which now exceeds $1.25 billion in ARR, and by log management and APM products, which each surpassed $750 million in ARR. Products outside the three main pillars grew to contribute over $200 million in ARR.
* The company recorded record bookings in Q4, surpassing $1 billion, though Pomel clarified that bookings do not immediately translate into revenue.
* CFO David Obstler stated, "Q4 revenue was $738 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter," and noted stable customer usage trends with significant contributions from AI-native customers.
* Datadog expanded its product portfolio, launching Kubernetes autoscaling, LLM observability, and Datadog On Call, which has already gained strong customer interest.

### Outlook

* For Q1 2025, revenue guidance is set at $737 million to $741 million, with non-GAAP net income per share expected to range from $0.41 to $0.43.
* For FY2025, revenue guidance is projected between $3.175 billion and $3.195 billion, representing 18% to 19% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to range from $1.65 to $1.70, supported by ongoing investments in sales, marketing, and R&D.
* Obstler emphasized the company's intent to continue aggressive hiring and scaling efforts, particularly in less mature geographies and enterprise-focused sales.
