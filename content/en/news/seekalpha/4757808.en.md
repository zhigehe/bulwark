Thesis
------

McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:[MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")) stock has gained around 15% in the past six months as it surged recently amid hopes of a growth recovery in the business. In the below analysis, I determine that the technicals are strong for the stock, but the fundamentals are rather lackluster. Most recent earnings show marginally negative revenue growth and flat EPS growth at zero. While this is the case, the P/S ratio is at above average levels, leading me to believe that the stock is overvalued at current levels. In my view, so far, there has been no clear evidence that MCD is turning the corner in its path to growth recovery, and so I don't particularly like the fundamental setup. But since the technicals are currently bullish, I initiate MCD at a hold rating.

### Charting

#### Trends

MCD stock recently broke out of its downtrend that started back in October. The trend line pressured the stock until earlier this month. This breakout means that the downtrend is over, but investors should still wait a bit longer for a clear nearer term uptrend to form before drawing conclusions.

#### Support

In addition to the former downtrend line's support, there are two other significant support levels identified above. The nearer one is at around 302 and represents heavy resistance back from late October to mid-December. The other support area is in the mid-290s, and represents the recent major upside gap that occurred on high volume, adding to its significance.

#### Resistance

There are two major resistance levels above the stock currently. The nearer one is at around 314 and is the level at which a downside gap occurred in October. The volume on that day was the strongest in six months, and so its relevance is very high. The other resistance area is the all-time high in the stock at around 318 set in October, days before the downside gap at 314. The stock could experience resistance there if it attempts to make a new high.

#### Takeaway

I would say that this chart is a slightly net positive one for MCD. The stock broke out of its downtrend and looks to be in the early stages of an uptrend, but there are both significant resistance and support levels. Therefore, some horizontal drift in the stock could occur, moving forward.

#### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The 50-day SMA had a bullish golden cross with the 200-day SMA back in September. The gap between the SMAs expanded to a large degree but has been shrinking in the past few months, indicating weakening momentum. Currently, the gap is holding stable, showing that long-term bullishness has at least stopped receding.

#### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The 9 day EMA had a bullish crossover with the 21 day EMA at the end of January. This is a signal of near term strength in MCD stock and currently, the gap between the EMAs is at its greatest level yet since the crossover, indicating accelerating near term bullish momentum. The stock trades above the EMAs and SMAs currently, as a clear signal of near term strength as well.

#### Bollinger Bands

The stock broke above the midline in late January, another signal of strength. This was an early sign that the downtrend in the stock was weakening and that the stock could be nearing a breakout. The midline also provided support in early February, further evidence that the downtrend was over. Currently, the stock has rocketed above the upper band and is in an extremely overbought state, and so further gains are unlikely before a slight correction or pause.

#### Takeaway

I believe it is clear that these moving averages are bullish for MCD stock. The SMAs show stabilizing long-term bullishness, the EMAs reflect accelerating near term bullish momentum, and the Bollinger Bands provided key signals that served to confirm that the downtrend was coming to an end.

#### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD broke above its signal line in late January, a bullish crossover. After the gap between the lines shrunk earlier this month, the MACD has pulled away significantly, as shown by the strong histogram. This shows that momentum has reaccelerated after a brief correction. For the longer term, the MACD did show some negative divergence at the all-time high in the stock back in October, as the MACD did not make a major peak and was lower than levels seen in late September.

#### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is currently at 75.05 and is of course within the 70+ zone, showing that the bulls are in clear control of MCD stock. The RSI has been developing an uptrend of its own since early January, and so further strength cannot be ruled out at this point. Unlike the MACD, the RSI did confirm the all-time high in the stock, as it made its six-month high during that period.

#### Stochastics

The bearish crossover in the stochastics that occurred in late January turned out to be a false signal and merely reflected a correction, as there was a bullish crossover earlier this month. This could be seen as a continuation of the clear bullish crossover from back in early January. Currently, both the %K and %D lines are well within the 80+ zone, and so the bulls are in clear control according to this indicator as well. The stochastics also shows some bearish divergence at the October all-time high as this indicator made a lower high.

#### Takeaway

In the near term, these indicators are very bullish for MCD stock. The MACD reflects accelerating bullish momentum, the RSI is on an uptrend and above 70, and the stochastics is in the 80+ zone. For the long run, the MACD and stochastics showed negative divergence at the all-time high in the stock, while the RSI did provide confirmation. Therefore, the peak in the stock is somewhat questionable and shows that long-term strength could be an issue for the stock.

#### Quarterly Results

MCD released their [2024 Q4 earnings](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/MCD-Q4-24-Earnings-Release.pdf) just days ago and showed weak results overall in my view. They reported revenues of $6.388 billion, basically unchanged YoY from $6.406 billion and a GAAP diluted EPS of $2.80, unchanged YoY. In adjusted terms, diluted EPS actually declined 4% YoY from $2.95 to $2.83. As shown in the above chart, revenue growth has dropped ever so slightly into negative territory and is in a worrying downtrend since late 2023. Overall, revenue growth is currently at below average levels in relation to the past three years. EPS growth is currently flat and shows not much improvement despite the downtrend in growth seemingly slowing down. EPS growth is also at below average levels compared to the past years. These results' performance versus [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD/earnings) was also poor, as they missed revenue expectations by $88.01 million, GAAP EPS expectations by $0.06, and adjusted EPS by $0.03. The highlight of this earning report is likely the fact that they experienced global comparable sales growth of 0.4% YoY with their International Developmental Licensed Markets segment leading the way with 4.1% growth. But overall, these financial results are nothing to get excited about, as I believe there aren't many promising signs that show the business is reaccelerating.

### Valuation

#### Price To Sales Ratio (P/S)

The P/S ratio is currently at 8.639 and is at above average levels compared to the past three years. This ratio surged recently from a sub 8.0 level to the current reading. I believe this ratio shows overvaluation in MCD stock. As discussed above, revenue growth has turned marginally negative and is on a worrying downtrend. In addition, it is also below the average of past years. Therefore, there is a significant disconnect between revenue growth and the P/S ratio, since this multiple is significantly above its average. This is a clear indication of overvaluation relative to historic growth. Currently, the [median P/S](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD/valuation/metrics) for the Consumer Discretionary sector is only 0.97 and so MCD is trading at a nearly 800% premium to peers. This premium is unlikely to be justified given the state of their growth in revenues.

#### Price To Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The P/E ratio looks to be at slightly below average levels in relation to the past three years. This ratio recently surged from a sub 25 reading to now 27.24. I believe this ratio is more reasonable for MCD and generally shows a fairer valuation in the stock. If you compare the P/E chart to the EPS growth chart above, you can see that the P/E ratio is tracking the growth rate quite well and there is no major disconnect currently. Growth seems to be a bit below average and this ratio is also a bit below its average, and so the valuation seems fair relative to historic EPS growth data. The Consumer Discretionary sector median P/E ratio is currently 19.27. This still shows that MCD is trading at a premium to peers, but is much less severe than for the P/S ratio. Overall, I believe this multiple shows near fair valuation to maybe perhaps modest overvaluation.

#### Takeaway

I conclude that MCD stock is currently moderately overvalued. The P/S ratio was highly disconnected from the revenue growth rate and was at an extreme premium over the sector, but the P/E ratio tracked EPS growth well and was at a much milder premium to peers. Therefore, I believe a moderate overvaluation assessment is correct.

Conclusion
----------

In the above analysis, I have determined that the overall technicals look strong as the charts, moving averages, and indicators all showed relatively promising signals. For the fundamentals, when I look at the most recent earnings, I don't see clear evidence that a recovery in growth is occurring. Revenue growth is marginally negative and EPS growth is flat at zero. The valuation also seems excessive currently according to the multiples, particularly the P/S ratio, as it shows that the valuation is detached from the reality of the financials. While the P/E shows that the valuation is more fair, the overall conclusion is that the stock is currently moderately overvalued. Therefore, with the technicals being bullish but the fundamentals being unattractive, I initiate MCD stock at a hold rating.
