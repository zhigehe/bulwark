Investment environment
----------------------

Global equities markets were flat in the fourth quarter. November was the strongest month, as Donald Trump’s convincing win in the U.S. presidential election sparked a U.S. rally, with investors hoping that his economic policies would spur growth and lower taxes.

Gains reversed in December as hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and the resultant sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The Fed said it expected to make fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 because inflation would likely take longer to return to below its 2% target. In Europe, U.S. President-elect Trump’s threat to implement trade tariffs against the European Union and political upheaval in European economic powerhouses Germany and France sapped investor morale, leading to weak equity market returns.

Overall, global listed real estate underperformed wider equity markets, declining 9.5% amid upheaval in bond markets. U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs) had a challenging quarter, falling 6.6% after a more hawkish tone from the Fed about further cuts sent shock waves through the bond market in December, with 10-year U.S. Treasury bond ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y)) yields hitting a six-month high of 4.57%. German, UK and Swedish property stocks were particularly weak, posting double-digit declines driven by political instability, rising bond yields, and worries over possible tariffs. Asian property stocks also saw sharp declines, although Japan held in on a relative basis despite material yen weakness after The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided not to raise interest rates at its December policy meeting, adopting a less hawkish stance. In the U.S., at a property sector level most sectors posted negative returns, with rate-sensitive sectors such as cell towers, self-storage, and industrials hit hardest. Cyclical areas of the property market outperformed, notably malls and hotels. Residential sectors were also relative outperformers, as higher base rates tend to translate into higher mortgage rates – a positive for demand in all forms of rental housing.

Portfolio review
----------------

Hotel operator Wyndham Hotels & Resorts ([WH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WH "Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.")) was a key contributor to outperformance, following another set of strong results and signs of inflecting demand for economy and mid-scale hotels. Data center landlord Equinix ([EQIX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQIX "Equinix, Inc.")) and retail mall REIT Macerich ([MAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAC "The Macerich Company")) also contributed positively, benefiting from a pro-growth rally in U.S. equities following Trump’s decisive election victory.

Conversely, cold-storage owner/operator Lineage ([LINE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LINE "Lineage, Inc.")) detracted from relative returns, with debut results showing some softness in fundamentals following its summer initial public offering. Public Storage ([PSA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSA "Public Storage")) also hurt relative returns in what was a difficult quarter for the storage sector, with sentiment impacted by a less favorable interest rate environment that drove mortgage rates higher. Multi-family residential landlord Canadian Apartment Properties ([OTC:CDPYF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDPYF "Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust")) also detracted following the Canadian government’s announcement of immigration cuts to curb population growth.

Manager outlook

In most markets globally, we believe we are now at an inflection point for real estate, following a two-year correction in the wake of rising interest rates. Confidence that interest rates have peaked and with many central banks now easing, we anticipate a much more supportive backdrop for real estate.

We expect public REITs to continue to lead the recovery, boosted by more exposure to winning real estate sectors, lower leverage, and a cost- and access-to-capital advantage providing a pathway for growth. Importantly, public REITs have continued to offer reliable and growing income streams, a characteristic that we think could continue to reward investors.

This may limit available investments and cause performance and exposures to differ from, and potentially be more concentrated in certain areas than, the broader market.  **FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Index** reflects the performance of real estate companies and real estate investment trusts (REITS) from developed and emerging markets, and is shown gross or net of foreign withholding taxes.
