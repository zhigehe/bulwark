### Management View

* CEO DJ Busch highlighted that core FFO per share grew by 5% for both the quarter and the year, marking three consecutive years of above-sector average cash flow growth. He attributed this to increased occupancy, strong leasing spreads, and strategic capital allocation. He emphasized the sustained demand driven by Sun Belt population growth and limited retail development.
* The company acquired four high-quality properties in Q4 2024, including two properties in Charleston and one in Fort Myers, reflecting a total acquisition amount of $282 million for the year. Dispositions totaled $68 million.
* CFO Mike Phillips reported a full-year same-property NOI of $162.6 million, a 5% growth over 2023, and a Q4 same-property NOI growth of 7.1%. He stated that net leverage stood at 23%, and the company’s debt structure is now 100% fixed with a weighted average interest rate of 4%.
* COO Christy David noted that leased occupancy reached 97.4%, with small shop leased occupancy achieving an all-time high of 93.3%. She also highlighted blended comparable leasing spreads of 11.3% for the year and a retention rate of 94%, emphasizing tenant retention as a key strategy to reduce costs and downtime.

### Outlook

* NAREIT FFO guidance for 2025 was set at $1.83 to $1.89 per share, representing a 4.5% mid-point increase over 2024. Core FFO guidance was stated at $1.79 to $1.83 per share, reflecting a 4.6% mid-point increase.
* Net acquisition guidance for 2025 stands at $100 million, with plans for capital recycling from California properties.

### Financial Results

* The company increased its annual cash dividend by 5% to $0.95 per share for 2025.

### Q&A

* Dori Kesten, Wells Fargo: Asked about the $100 million net investment guidance and whether it assumes increased dispositions. CEO DJ Busch responded that the figure is conservative and depends on capital recycling from California properties, where proceeds could be redeployed into other markets.
* Jeff Spector, Bank of America: Inquired about balance sheet leverage and acquisitions. CEO Busch noted that the company remains opportunistic, leveraging equity raised in 2024 and the potential for selective acquisitions in high-growth markets.
* Linda Tsai, Jefferies: Questioned the demand for California assets and pricing expectations. CEO Busch stated that demand has been strong, and the company will only proceed with sales if redeployment opportunities meet strategic goals.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for 2025 reflects a slightly reduced same-property NOI growth range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the raised 2024 guidance of 4.25% to 5% in Q3. However, core FFO guidance shows a steady growth trajectory.
* Leasing spreads improved to 11.3% in Q4 from 9.8% in Q3, indicating stronger tenant demand.
* Management maintained its focus on Sun Belt markets and capital recycling, with increased emphasis on new acquisitions in smaller, high-growth markets such as Charleston.
* Analysts’ questions in Q4 shifted toward acquisition strategies and noncore asset dispositions, compared to Q3’s focus on equity issuance and operational fundamentals.

### Risks and Concerns

* Analysts raised concerns about the competitive acquisition environment and the company’s ability to maintain leasing spreads and retention rates.
