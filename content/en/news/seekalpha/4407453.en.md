Commerzbank ([OTCPK:CRZBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRZBF "Commerzbank AG")) Thursday said that it would cut 3,900 full-time equivalent positions by 2028, as it looks to stave off any takeover bid by Italy's UniCredit.

Commerzbank ([OTCPK:CRZBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRZBF "Commerzbank AG")) [said the cuts](https://www.commerzbank.de/group/what-drives-us/fostering-success/apc-and-cmd-2025.html "said the cuts"), which would mainly affect sites in Germany, would come as the bank makes "efficiency gains" from digitalization and increased use of overseas sites.

The bank estimates restructuring charges of around €700M before tax effects in 2025.

The lender also increased its financial targets, aiming for a net profit of €4.2 billion euros by 2028, up from about €2.7 billion in 2024.

In addition, it now aims for a cost-to-income ratio of 53% in 2027, up from a previous goal of 54%.

The cost-cutting measures come after UniCredit last year [increased its stake](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/press-media/press-releases-price-sensitive/2024/december/unicredit-enters-into-additional-instruments-relating-to-commerz.html "increased its stake") in Commerzbank ([OTCPK:CRZBF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRZBF "Commerzbank AG")) to around 28%. The Milan-based bank also announced it had requested the European Central Bank's permission to raise its stake to 29.9% — just short of the 30% threshold that would require it to make a public offer for the entire bank.

Commerzbank's 2024 revenues rose 6% to €11.1 billion driven by strong customer business, while net result increased by 20% to around €2.7 billion.
