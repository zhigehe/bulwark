The Trump administration has ordered states to put a stop to build a $5B program to install EV fast chargers on the country’s highways, according to a memo by the National Transportation Highway Safety Administration.

[The memo dated Thursday tells](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/resources/state-plan-approval-suspension.pdf) state transportation directors that plans approved by the Biden administration are suspended until the U.S. Department of Transportation releases new guidelines this spring. 

The Washington Post [quoted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/06/trump-ev-charging-halt-transportation-department/) analytics firm Paren as saying that only 55 charging stations have been installed so far.

The program, known as the National Electric Vehicle Formula Program, was approved as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Congress approved in November 2021.

The law allocated another $2.5B for the installation of chargers in local communities.

States will still receive “reimbursement of existing obligations,” the memo said.
