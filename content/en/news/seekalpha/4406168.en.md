Earnings Call Insights: Danaos Corporation (NYSE:[DAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DAC "Danaos Corporation")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO John Coustas noted that Danaos is "highly insulated from near-term market uncertainty" with 97% of charter coverage for 2025 and 79% for 2026. The company’s $3.4 billion charter backlog was emphasized as a critical factor providing income certainty and flexibility for investment opportunities.
* The company has arranged a new $850 million syndicated loan facility to fully finance all vessels under construction, highlighting a continued focus on fleet modernization and expansion.
* CFO Evangelos Chatzis reported adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 at $6.93, compared to $6.99 in Q4 2023. He attributed the slight decrease to elevated operating expenses and finance costs, partially offset by higher operating revenues and investment income.
* Danaos has repurchased an additional $45.6 million in stock since the last earnings release, bringing total buybacks to $168.8 million out of the $200 million authorized.
* The company’s net debt stood at $291 million as of December 31, 2024, with a low net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. Liquidity, including cash and revolving credit availability, totaled $807 million.

### Outlook

* Management highlighted that the company’s fleet is 97% chartered for 2025 and 79% for 2026, providing visibility and resilience in an uncertain market environment.
* Newbuilding investments were emphasized, with a focus on fuel-efficient container vessels. Coustas stated that modern and efficient ships are key to meeting future market requirements, with minimal risk associated with the company’s investments due to secured financing and charters.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2024 increased 9.9% year-over-year to $189.7 million, driven by higher operating revenues and investment income.
* Vessel operating expenses rose to $45.6 million, reflecting an expanded fleet, though daily operating costs improved slightly to $6,135 per vessel per day. General and administrative expenses decreased to $21.7 million due to lower stock-based non-cash costs.
* Interest expense increased to $9.1 million due to higher average indebtedness and lower capitalized interest on vessels under construction.
* Liquidity remained robust, with cash at $453.4 million and total liquidity at $807 million, providing flexibility for capital deployment.

### Q&A

* Omar Nokta, Jefferies: Asked about whether Danaos is on track to achieve a net cash position in 2025 and the company’s preference for leverage. CEO Coustas responded that Danaos remains in surplus and does not anticipate moving into a negative net cash position despite the significant newbuilding program.
* Clement Mullins, Value Investors Edge: Inquired about dry bulk fleet utilization and drydock plans for 2025. Coustas explained that the dry bulk fleet has undergone extensive drydocking in the past six months, with no further drydockings planned for the next two to three years.
* Omar Nokta, Jefferies: Asked what prompted Danaos to resume newbuilding orders. Coustas highlighted the need for modern, efficient ships and secured financing and charters as factors minimizing risk.
* Mullins raised a follow-up on dry bulk investments, questioning whether Danaos would expand its focus beyond capesizes. Coustas affirmed a continued focus on capesizes but would consider adding assets if opportunities arise.
