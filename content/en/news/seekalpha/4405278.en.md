Sportradar Group AG (NASDAQ:[SRAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRAD "Sportradar Group AG")) gained in Friday trading after announcing a long-term extension with MLB that is seen as an expansion of their decade-long partnership. The new terms are set to begin with the 2025 season. As part of the agreement, MLB has acquired an equity stake in Sportradar (NASDAQ:[SRAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SRAD "Sportradar Group AG")), further solidifying the partnership between the two organizations and supporting future growth opportunities.
