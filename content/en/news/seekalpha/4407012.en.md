JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) started notifying employees of job cuts last week, as part of its plan to trim staff throughout the year, according to a media report.

The overall headcount at America's largest bank by assets may not necessarily decline as the company hires in other operations. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had 317,233 employees, up 2% Y/Y.

In February, fewer than 1,000 employees will be laid off, *Barron's* reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:[JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) is also planning cuts for mid-March, May, June, August, and September, they said. The total number of jobs to be cut for the year is unclear, the report said.

A company spokesperson told *Barron's* that the cuts will impact a "very small number" of employees and are part of the company's regular process of assessing its businesses.

Not every business line will be affected in each round of job cuts, the people told Barron's. Some people received their layoff notifications on Feb. 5, with several of them occurring in the Houston office, the article [said.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/jpmorgan-chase-layoffs-466567b0?mod=hp_LEDE_C_4 "said.")

During JPMorgan Chase's ([JPM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM "JPMorgan Chase & Co.")) Q4 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the company's headcount has grown significantly in the last few years, and that kind of increase is likely to introduce some amount of inefficiency. "So, we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions,.. [on roughly flat headcount](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4749688-jpmorgan-chase-and-co-jpm-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript "on roughly flat headcount")," he said. Those exceptions include headcount in branches and bankers and critical areas of risk and control, he said.
