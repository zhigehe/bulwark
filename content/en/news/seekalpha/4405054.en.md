Below is a rundown of the major quarterly updates anticipated in the week of February 10 to February 14:

Monday, February 10
-------------------

### McDonald's ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation"))

McDonald's ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")), the world's second-largest restaurant chain, is set to report its Q4 earnings on Monday. Analysts anticipate a slight revenue increase, but project a 3% decline in profits compared to the previous year.

While Wall Street analysts remain bullish with a consensus Buy rating, Seeking Alpha’s quant model is more cautious, assigning a [Hold rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating) due largely to valuation concerns.

SA author Luca Socci [argues](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752577-mcdonalds-committed-to-winning-the-value-battle-q4-earnings-preview) that McDonald’s franchise model provides stable, recurring revenue with lower operational risk but limits gains during periods of strong sales growth. Despite challenges such as high commodity costs and traffic slowdowns, the company’s expansion strategy and value meal offerings aim to sustain growth and drive customer volume, the analyst said.

* Consensus EPS Estimates: $2.86
* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $6.48B
* Earnings Insight: McDonald’s has missed EPS and revenue estimates twice in the past 8 quarters.

**Also reporting:** Prospect Capital Corporation ([PSEC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSEC "Prospect Capital Corporation")), Vertex Pharmaceuticals ([VRTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated")), ON Semiconductor Corporation ([ON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON "ON Semiconductor Corporation")), Danaos Corporation ([DAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DAC "Danaos Corporation")), Incyte Corporation ([INCY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INCY "Incyte Corporation")), Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals ([ARWR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARWR "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.")), CoreCivic ([CXW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXW "CoreCivic, Inc.")), Rockwell Automation ([ROK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK "Rockwell Automation, Inc.")), Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance ([ARI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARI "Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.")), Coty ([COTY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COTY "Coty Inc.")) and more.

Tuesday, February 11
--------------------

### The Coca-Cola Company ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company"))

Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")) is set to unveil its Q4 earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday, following closely on the heels of a mixed quarterly update from its main competitor, PepsiCo ([PEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP "PepsiCo, Inc.")).

Sell side analysts maintain a notably bullish outlook on Coca-Cola's prospects, with a Buy recommendation, while Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system assigns it a [Hold rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating).

Jefferies recently [upgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4400714-coca-cola-gains-after-jefferies-turns-bullish-ahead-of-earnings) Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")) to a Buy rating, previously holding a Neutral stance, citing the company's strong business performance. Kaumil Gajrawala highlighted Coca-Cola's increasing volumes, solid pricing, and expected cash flow improvement.

Noah's Arc Capital Management, a Seeking Alpha author, has [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754547-coca-cola-q4-preview-trump-tariff-loser-rating-downgrade) Coca-Cola to a Hold rating, citing risks from tariffs imposed on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. These tariffs are likely to raise Coca-Cola's input costs, compress margins, and potentially lead to price hikes.

* Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.52
* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $10.70B
* Earnings Insight: The beverage giant has beaten EPS and revenue expectations in 8 straight quarters.

**Also reporting:** Gilead Sciences ([GILD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GILD "Gilead Sciences, Inc.")), Shopify ([SHOP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHOP "Shopify Inc.")), Energy Transfer LP Common Units ([ET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET "Energy Transfer LP Common Units")), BP p.l.c. ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")), W. P. Carey ([WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")), DuPont de Nemours ([DD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DD "DuPont de Nemours, Inc.")), Upstart Holdings ([UPST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST "Upstart Holdings, Inc.")), American International Group ([AIG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIG "American International Group, Inc.")), Marriott International ([MAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAR "Marriott International, Inc.")), Welltower ([WELL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WELL "Welltower Inc.")), Lyft ([LYFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT "Lyft, Inc.")), DoorDash ([DASH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASH "DoorDash, Inc.")), and more.

Wednesday, February 12
----------------------

### Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc."))

Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc.")) is set to release its results after Wednesday’s closing bell, following a strong previous quarter that prompted the company to raise its full-year sales outlook to $55.3B–$56.3B. This was up from a previous range of $55B–$56.2B. Cisco also lifted its adjusted EPS guidance to $3.60–$3.66 per share, surpassing the prior range of $3.52–$3.58.

While Wall Street analysts maintain a Buy rating on the tech giant, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system suggests a [Hold](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating).

Last month, Citi [initiated](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4396181-cisco-sees-positive-catalyst-watch-at-citi-ahead-of-earnings) a 30-Day Catalyst Watch on Cisco ([CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc.")), set to expire on Feb. 16, with analyst Atif Malik highlighting the company's potential to benefit from improvements in the campus switching market, which comprises about 20% of Cisco’s sales.

Seeking Alpha author Vladimir Dimitrov [notes](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750500-cisco-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-rating-downgrade) that while Cisco's business transition and restructuring are progressing well, rising risks underneath the surface appear to outweigh the positives at this point, despite satisfactory shareholder returns in the past year.

* Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.91
* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $13.87B
* Earnings Insight: Cisco has beaten EPS and revenue estimates in 8 straight quarters.

**Also reporting:** CVS Health ([CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")), The Trade Desk ([TTD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTD "The Trade Desk, Inc.")), The Kraft Heinz Company ([KHC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC "The Kraft Heinz Company")), Medical Properties Trust ([MPW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPW "Medical Properties Trust, Inc.")), QuantumScape ([QS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QS "QuantumScape Corporation")), Fastly ([FSLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSLY "Fastly, Inc.")), Dominion Energy ([D](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D "Dominion Energy, Inc.")), Biogen ([BIIB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB "Biogen Inc.")), STAG Industrial ([STAG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STAG "STAG Industrial, Inc.")), Albemarle Corporation ([ALB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALB "Albemarle Corporation")), MGM Resorts International ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) and more.

Thursday, February 13
---------------------

### Airbnb ([ABNB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB "Airbnb, Inc."))

Airbnb ([ABNB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB "Airbnb, Inc.")) is set to release its Q4 earnings on Thursday after the market close, with analysts projecting a 9% Y/Y revenue increase. Both Wall Street analysts and Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating system maintain a [Hold rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating) on the stock, amid concerns over growth and valuation.

SA contributor Michael Del Monte, who holds a Buy rating, [argues](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755964-airbnb-stock-beaten-down-buy-before-experiences-brings-it-back) that despite a cautious analyst outlook on consumer discretionary spending, TSA data suggests travel volumes improved during the 2024-2025 winter. He also notes that Airbnb’s planned re-release of Experiences across 100+ cities in May 2025 could drive app engagement and revenue. However, increased investments may lead to margin compression, though a successful launch of Experiences could strengthen Airbnb’s operating leverage.

* Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.58
* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $2.42B
* Earnings Insight: Airbnb has surpassed revenue expectations for 8 consecutive quarters and beaten EPS estimates in 5 of those reports.

**Also reporting:** Roku ([ROKU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU "Roku, Inc.")), Organon ([OGN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OGN "Organon & Co.")), Twilio ([TWLO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWLO "Twilio Inc.")), Applied Materials ([AMAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT "Applied Materials, Inc.")), Iron Mountain Incorporated ([IRM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRM "Iron Mountain Incorporated")), Coinbase Global ([COIN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN "Coinbase Global, Inc.")), DraftKings ([DKNG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DKNG "DraftKings Inc.")), Duke Energy Corporation ([DUK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK "Duke Energy Corporation")), Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PANW "Palo Alto Networks, Inc.")), Deere & Company ([DE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DE "Deere & Company")), British American Tobacco p.l.c. ([BTI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTI "British American Tobacco p.l.c.")), Datadog ([DDOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DDOG "Datadog, Inc.")), Unilever PLC ([UL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL "Unilever PLC")), Wynn Resorts, Limited ([WYNN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNN "Wynn Resorts, Limited")), Sony Group Corporation ([SONY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SONY "Sony Group Corporation")) and more.

Friday, February 14
-------------------

### Moderna ([MRNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRNA "Moderna, Inc."))

Moderna ([MRNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRNA "Moderna, Inc.")), the Massachusetts-based vaccine manufacturer, is set to report its Q4 results before Thursday’s market open. Analysts expect a significant 66% decline in top-line revenue.

Over the past 12 months, the company’s stock has similarly fallen by around 66%.

Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system upgraded its outlook on MRNA from [Strong Sell to Hold](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRNA/ratings/quant-ratings#source=firstLevelUrl%3Asymbol%7CbiSectionAsset%3ARatingSummary%7CbiName%3AQuant_rating) last month, bringing it in line with Wall Street analysts' consensus Hold rating.

The stock was recently [downgraded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4399960-moderna-stock-down-goldman-sachs-downgrades) by Goldman Sachs to Neutral from Buy, citing a lack of clarity over its revenue outlook. This downgrade follows the company's recent reduction in its 2025 revenue guidance, driven by lower demand for its COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines.

Additionally, Seeking Alpha Contributor Red Kraken Research [expressed concern](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754251-moderna-mrna-stock-good-news-isnt-enough) about Moderna's cost-cutting strategies, specifically the reduction in R&D spending, fearing it could hinder the company's research capabilities. They recommended focusing on cuts in SG&A expenses instead.

* Consensus EPS Estimates: -$2.70
* Consensus Revenue Estimates: $951.09M
* Earnings Insight: Moderna has beaten revenue estimates in a straight 8 quarters. Missing EPS twice in that time frame.

**Also reporting:** Paramount Global ([PARA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PARA "Paramount Global")), iRobot Corporation ([IRBT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRBT "iRobot Corporation")), Stem ([STEM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STEM "Stem, Inc.")), Redfin Corporation ([RDFN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDFN "Redfin Corporation")) and more.
