Prudential Financial (NYSE:[PRU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRU "Prudential Financial, Inc.")) shares traded in the red on Friday, making it the seventh straight session of losses. Stock closed down 0.62% at $112.82.

PRU has risen 3.7% in the last 12 months compared to the broader S&P 500 market, which rose 21.2%.

Looking at Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings, this company has a Hold rating with a score of 3.16 out of 5.

When it comes to Wall Street analysis, 13 out of 16 analysts recommend a Hold, 2 rated it as a Strong Buy and 1 rated it as a Sell.

According to SA analyst Seeking Profits, “The company faced underwriting pressure and adverse mortality results, missing earnings estimates, but PGIM showed strength with positive net flows and rising assets. Reinsurance costs and currency dynamics weighed on US and international earnings, but the investment portfolio remains solid despite CRE risk.

PRU's capital return policy underwhelmed, with subdued buybacks as reinsurance transactions have not sufficiently lifted capital, which likely leaves shares rangebound.”

Seeking Alpha analysts have a Hold rating on the company.
