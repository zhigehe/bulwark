About five years ago, I wrote [an article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4360989-berkshire-hathaway-cash-a-historical-perspective-and-likelihood-for-some-significant-buyback "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4360989-berkshire-hathaway-cash-a-historical-perspective-and-likelihood-for-some-significant-buyback") on Berkshire Hathaway’s cash pile, which seemed impossibly high back then, at +$130 billion. Oh, how times change. In that piece, I calculated some ratios going all the way back to 1995 to try and see the cash position in ration to other numbers in the balance sheet like total assets, total stockholders’ equity and float.

I concluded by stating that it was becoming ever harder for Buffett to neglect meaningful share repurchases (or “eating his own cooking”) as an outlet for this cash. As stocks continued to drift higher in the post-pandemic and stimulus era, Buffett, finding no elephant to deploy cash, went on the cannibalism route with gusto.

Berkshire repurchased $70 billion worth of its shares in the period from 2020 to 2024, a significant step-up from the $5 billion it bought back during 2018-19 when buybacks started.

Did that take care of the cash excess? Well no, not even close. As we all know, Buffett has been selling down his massive AAPL position. Such sales, along with the smaller dispositions of Bank of America ([BAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC "Bank of America Corporation")), have meant that cash was, as of September 30th, over $320 billion.

Updated cash ratios:
--------------------

The relationship between float and cash broke down completely. Up until last year, Berkshire's float – measured as loss and loss adjustment expenses plus unearned premiums – had been greater than cash. This is no longer the case.

Float and Cash (Author - Berkshire 10-Qs)



Most of the additional cash is the result of stock sales, not of a large increase in insurance operations, so it is natural that this historic relationship no longer holds.

On the other hand, the relationship between i) cash to assets and ii) cash to equity, while at a peak, is not as dramatic:

The previous peak happened in the first half of 2005. I’m sure most of us remember what happened two or three years later. That is not to say that Buffett is expressing a view on the market by selling down his largest stock positions. I don’t believe that to be the case. There could be many reasons for his sale decisions, here are some I have gathered:

Initially, after last year's annual meeting, the leading theory seemed to be that Berkshire was getting ahead of potential income tax increases in the future. This is possible, we shall see if sales continue in the new regime of no imminent tax increases.

One theory I like because it matches Buffett’s personality, is that he did not want to leave his successor, Greg Abel, the problem of deciding when to sell such an oversized and appreciated position. Managing this would have been a catch-22 for his successor. Requiring nothing but perfect timing to avoid looking foolish.

In another vein, some say this is Buffett continuing to evolve. After not selling Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")) in the 90s, when it commanded extreme multiples, the position generated sub-par returns for the next couple of decades. This view has merit, and his decision is simplified in Apple’s case because he is not a director in the company as he was back then for Coke.

To these views, I add that, like 2004 and 2005, short-term interest rates are currently high. The Fed was trying to cool down the economy back then; and to tame inflation today, by increasing short-term rates. It is therefore less painful now to hold hundreds of billions in T-bills earning +4% than it was at any time. Any time except the prior occasion when cash peaked relative to assets.

Add to this fact the high APPL multiple (in the 30s) and – for now at least – the earnings yield from Apple is lower than the T-bill rate. It could be as simple as that.

Only Buffett knows his thinking, and his reasoning could be a combination of things in the list above, or not. What is more important for us is how to think about BRK going forward, given the cash position, level of public equity valuations and its own valuation.

What now?
---------

The $320 billion problem is not easy to solve. It will very likely move higher when Berkshire reports Q4 later this month. As rolling snowballs pick up snow, this pile will produce at least $12 billion in investment income per year.

As valuations for public equities continue to be high, it is unlikely that Buffett will dust off the elephant gun unless he aims a few shots at Europe or Asia (unlikely in both cases). Although US equity valuations are high by virtually any measure, we only need to look at his own actions to glean his opinion. Only light purchases of Occidental ([OXY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY "Occidental Petroleum Corporation")) and Chubb ([CB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CB "Chubb Limited")) the past few months.

To make matters “worse” Berkshire shares are not patently undervalued, as they were before. At a trillion-dollar market cap, the margin of safety has been diminished.

### Berkshire Valuation

Despite the much larger size, Berkshire has kept up and slightly outperform what I consider to be its (shrinking) peer group. Nothing really compares to Berkshire, however both Markel ([MKL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MKL "Markel Group Inc.")) and Fairfax Financial ([OTCPK:FRFHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRFHF "Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited")) are modeled on Berkshire's template of using insurance float to invest elsewhere.

The company stopped using Price-to-Book to guide share buybacks a few years ago. Arguing convincingly that historical prices for controlled businesses unduly depress book value. Controlled businesses are not as high a proportion of carrying value in Markel and Fairfax, therefore a premium in Book value for Berkshire is expected and observed.

Taking a more pragmatic approach, let’s ask the expert, Warren himself, what he thinks of Berkshire’s value. We know he restrains from buying shares unless he sees a margin of safety from a conservatively derived valuation. He applies this to all purchases, including buybacks.

Berkshire repurchased zero shares in Q3 2024. The share price – I will use B-shares as this is what most of us mortals hold - has been trading above $425 since July, so it is likely that no further repurchases have occurred since then. Their last purchases were in Q2 for token amounts. Q1 saw the last real substantial repurchase activity, and this was done at a price of about $400.

We can gather that, a year ago, Buffett appraised the intrinsic value to be around $400/0.8 – an assumed MOS - or $500/share. Given that intrinsic value grows each year, we might expect repurchase to re-start somewhere in the $430 region, a price some 10% lower as I write this.

### The unmentionable "D" word:

Until that happens, and as cash continues to pile up, we are left to contemplate the “risk” of a dividend. I don’t expect this to happen, and I surely don’t wish for it to happen. But the fact is that Berkshire policy has always been clear. There is no blanket dividend prohibition.

If or when they don’t feel that retaining an earned dollar will generate at least a dollar in future market value, then they will return it. There are only two ways to return said dollar, if the shares are too costly to buy back, then the unthinkable becomes possible.

If that were to happen, I would not be surprised, but I would be unhappy. Of course, all of us shareholders can take the dividend and buy back shares on our own. But the taxman will take a slice along the way. More importantly - even ignoring taxes - cash at Berkshire is worth more than cash in our collective pockets.

A dollar is not worth a dollar in this case. Let’s go back a couple of decades and imagine Berkshire had declared a special dividend and cleared out all excess cash in 2005, the last time it was this high in relation to the size of the balance sheet.

Many people would have been happy then, but the opportunity cost would have been unknown and incalculable. Would GE (and its spinoffs), Goldman or BAC be around today? Would the economy have survived a second - or third - Lehman? Not only were these investments fantastic for BRK shareholders, they also represented the “last dollar” available to the takers.

The main risk of owning Berkshire:
----------------------------------

BRK is the largest position in my portfolio. I feel extremely comfortable, as do most long-term holders, with that. Risks that are inherent to other corporations seem more than remote for Berkshire. No activist can attack, no accounting fraud is lurking. Debt, most of it non-recourse, is swamped by more than enough cash. The capital behind its underwriting ensures they are the last man standing. By far. The only risk that seems to worry Buffett is nuclear conflict.

But there is another worry, not for Buffett, but for us. He called it “Father time” in a [recent letter](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov2524.pdf "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov2524.pdf") discussing inheritance. At 94, each year we get is truly a gift. We have already lost Charlie, and the time will come for Greg to take the helm. This is already happening to some degree, but the real test will come during the next crisis.

The deployment of capital that occurs in the years beyond Buffett carries the real risk in owning Berkshire. It is one of underperformance, rather than permanent impairment of earnings or value. This may come from poor capital allocation, a breakdown of the culture, or the decentralized trust-based system.

The only way to “manage” this risk is to watch the actions and reasoning of future management. Looking for clues that the culture, the network of deserve trust, incentives, etc., are being preserved and strengthened. Or diluted and broken - and then vote with our feet.

Preserving this legacy is the mission of the board and its incoming Chairman, Howard Graham Buffett, and a tall order given how unique Berkshire is. Let’s hope they are all up to the task.

Putting it all together:
------------------------

I believe Berkshire – now more than ever – represents a solid risk-adjusted core holding for any portfolio. If things go pear-shaped from here, we may still get to see the GOAT one last time at what he does best. Nobody should wish for this to happen, and the hardship it entails, but unchanging human nature ensures it. The next crisis is always somewhere on the horizon.

Although apparently not currently offering a large enough margin of safety; at $470 the shares should be close to intrinsic value, some 15% above prices were buybacks happened a year ago.

In a crash, Berkshire shares may fall less than the market, either because of support from ramped-up repurchases or by the fact that 1/3 of the market capitalization is in cash. And having cash during distressful times is king. The “other side” of the crisis will look very fine indeed, as anti-fragile Berkshire has proven in every prior case.

The opposite is also true, cash will be a drag if things keep going up and to the right. Less of a drag at 4% rates but a drag, nevertheless. All options have a cost. Whenever it rains gold, I want Buffett to have the bathtub, rather than thousands of us having our own little cup.
