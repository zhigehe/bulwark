Introduction
------------

The optimism around **AppLovin** (NASDAQ:[APP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APP "AppLovin Corporation")) remains massive, and the stock soared by almost 30% yesterday to $492 after the fresh earnings release. This made my previous 'Strong sell' recommendation looking not good at all because the share price was around $300 [on November 18](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738395-applovin-overbought-and-overvalued).

It was a very painful lesson for me because I missed such a rally. But in this game, you must learn from mistakes and move forward. This time, I used much bolder valuation analysis assumptions, and the stock is overvalued under all scenarios. The forward P/E ratio dynamic looks quite attractive, but it factors in very aggressive EPS growth assumptions. I see a few big risks to AppLovin's ability to maintain such aggressive revenue growth, which I outline alongside the fresh Q4 earnings review. Despite being wrong with my previous call, I reiterate the 'Strong Sell' recommendation. I believe that risks and uncertainties around APP's ability to maintain exponential growth rate outweigh the current massive momentum.

Q4 earnings review
------------------

AppLovin delivered a solid Q4 performance with a [dual and confident beat against consensus estimates](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4407211-applovin-gaap-eps-of-1_73-beats-by-0_47-revenue-of-1_37b-beats-by-110m). Q4 revenue grew by a massive 44% year-over-year to $1.37 billion, and a $110 million beat was quite impressive. EPS also demonstrated robust growth and the actual figure of $1.73 was also substantially higher than the forecast of $1.26.

The impressive EPS performance was supported by the soaring adjusted EBITDA which grew by a staggering 78% year-over-year. The Q4 EBITDA margin was as high as 62%.

APP





Full-year revenue was $4.7 billion, representing a 43% growth compared to FY2023. The full-year adjusted EBITDA showed a growth of 78% with a 58% margin. Full-year free cash flow reached $2.1 billion, representing a 76% flow-through from adjusted EBITDA.

The vast optimism of the market post-earnings is also explained by a confident [Q1 2025 guidance from the management](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757653-applovin-corporation-app-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript). They expect the advertising revenue to be between $1.030 billion and $1.050 billion with an adjusted EBITDA margin expanding further and achieving around 78% margin.

APP





AppLovin's balance sheet has some cracks that investors should pay attention to. Let's look at the company's assets. Nearly $1.8 billion in goodwill and $896 million in other intangible assets. This represents roughly 45% of the company's total assets. If something goes south, like a failed acquisition or a market shift, that goodwill can get written down, leading to a massive PnL charge.

We also cannot say that the company is swimming in liquidity. The cash cushion of $741 million is not bad at first glance but looks subtle when stacked against their liabilities of over $4.7 billion. Moreover, there is a debt load problem. The total long-term debt is $3.5 billion, which is a big number as it represents more than 60% of APP's total liabilities.

Valuation analysis
------------------

AppLovin's forward P/E ratio looks extremely bullish as the metric is expected to significantly shrink over the next few years. The current level is certainly high, but the estimated FY2028 P/E of around 28 looks quite attractive.

Since the conclusions of my previous DCF model did not age well, it appears that I used an unfairly high discount rate of 10.5%. Therefore, this time I use a softer 9.5% WACC, which aligns with [the recommended range](https://valueinvesting.io/APP/valuation/wacc).

This time, I also want to simulate various valuation scenarios. In all scenarios, revenue projections for FY2026-2027 will be [from consensus](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APP/earnings). The FCF trajectory will also remain the same for all scenarios. The base year FCF margin assumption is [33.72%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APP/profitability). APP demonstrates a solid operating leverage, meaning that applying a 100-basis point yearly expansion is quite conservative. The number of shares outstanding is also the same for all scenarios, which is 335.59 million, according to [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APP).

Changes will relate to the latter years' revenue growth and the constant growth rate. The base-case scenario will be aggressive as it applies a very slight 25-basis point annual revenue growth rate deceleration. Furthermore, the constant growth rate is 7% very optimistic, the same that I applied for [my latest Nvidia analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757303-nvidia-path-to-5-trillion-plus-market-cap).

The market appears to be pricing all these aggressive assumptions. These assumptions are not unrealistic, but maintaining such a massive revenue growth is a very challenging task and certainly not guaranteed.

Moreover, the DCF model is very sensitive to changes in growth rates. For example, applying a slightly faster revenue growth deceleration after FY2027 (by 50-basis points yearly) together with a slightly slower 6.5% constant growth rate (which is still very optimistic) makes APP 20% overvalued.

Lastly, let's incorporate a 75-basis points yearly revenue growth deceleration after FY2027 and a 6% constant growth rate to demonstrate how the fair value behaves under this (relatively) conservative scenario.

With more conservative growth rates, the fair share price drops to $341. This means that the current share price includes a 31% premium over the fair value.

Risks surrounding growth durability
-----------------------------------

Now, here is where it gets the most interesting. I believe that there are real significant risks that can undermine APP's growth potential. The most obvious risk is that the company runs an asset-light model, which I see from its subtle CapEx levels. During the five years between 2019 and 2023, AppLovin's total cash spent on CapEx was around $13 million. I repeat, $13 million, not billion.

Of course, some people might say that despite low CapEx, APP has substantially grown R&D spending. This is true, but it is also true that it is highly likely that the major portion of R&D spending is non-cash as the TTM stock-based compensation ('SBC') chart trajectory mirrors the TTM R&D expense. Moreover, high SBC levels also mean that the company's FCF margin ex-SBC is significantly lower than the one I used for my DCF models.

There are also substantial regulatory risks. The regulatory hummer is not something mythical. For instance, [Dentons](https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/january/10/ai-trends-for-2025-data-privacy-and-cybersecurity) suggests that data privacy is likely to be the core topic amid the AI revolution this year, which might lead to new ads targeting limitations.

By the way, the AI revolution also evolves extremely rapidly. The competition in the field intensifies, and we see that the number of various generative AI models has significantly expanded over the last few months. All major U.S. techs have their own LLMs. This year started with news that there are also several emerging LLM models in China. In this context, technologies are poised to obsolete rapidly, and it is highly likely to relate not only to LLMs but to all AI-powered instruments. For example, [CRM greatly impressed the industry](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756885-salesforce-stock-waiting-for-a-major-catalyst-in-february) last year with its **Agentforce** offering. Just six months later, the same company already plans to release **Agentforce 2.0**, which is expected to deliver another level of experience for customers.

I think that this combination of risks including low entry barriers, rapidly evolving technological landscape, and likely new regulations in terms of AI tools pose a real threat to APP's long-term revenue growth prospects. Therefore, I believe that achieving even conservative growth rates (third scenario in my DCF model) will be very challenging for APP.

Mitigating factors
------------------

The biggest mitigating factor that plays against my bearishness is the fact that my previous thesis did not age well. The stock soared by around 64% since my November 'Strong Sell' recommendation, which will likely make many readers very skeptical about my thesis update.

The stock is far from the overbought zone, which might be a bullish indicator for investors. Therefore, the stock might continue soaring further even despite substantial and real threats to APP's long-term revenue growth prospects. Moreover, the share price is also supported by a massive momentum as the stock gained 700%+ over the last twelve months which will likely attract traders who will try to capitalize on the FOMO effect.

Conclusion
----------

I am not denying that the company's income statement is flashy at the moment. But flashy does not mean durable as there are cracks in the foundation. The market prices in a level of optimism that ignores some apparent significant risks which can spell trouble for the long haul. My take is that APP stays a 'Strong sell'.
