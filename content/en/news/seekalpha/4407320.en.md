### Management View

* Christian Bruch, President and CEO, highlighted strong operational performance in Q1 2025, with orders totaling €13.7 billion and an increase in the order backlog to a record €131 billion. Revenue grew by over 18%, and cash flow reached €1.5 billion.
* CEO Bruch emphasized the company’s positioning in promising markets such as offshore wind, nuclear, and grid technologies. Offshore wind is regaining momentum, supported by auctions in South Korea, Japan, and the UK, with global auctions of over 20 gigawatts expected in 2025.
* Siemens Energy plans to invest €2 billion in fiscal year 2025 to support growth, including capacity expansion for gas turbines in Berlin and manufacturing capabilities in Tampa, Florida, and Budapest.
* CFO Maria Ferraro reported a profit before special items of €481 million, supported by revenue growth across all business areas. Free cash flow exceeded expectations with a positive €1.5 billion.
* Ferraro confirmed S&P’s upgrade of the company’s rating outlook to stable from negative.

### Outlook

* Siemens Energy reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal year 2025, targeting 8% to 10% comparable revenue growth and a profit margin of 3% to 5%. Net income is projected to be around the breakeven mark, excluding special items.
* The company expects free cash flow pre-tax to exceed the previously guided €1 billion, with an update set for the half-year results.
* CEO Bruch noted that 93% of fiscal year 2025 revenue is already covered by the backlog, providing strong visibility and confidence in meeting targets.

### Financial Results

* Revenue for Q1 2025 reached €8.9 billion, driven by growth across all businesses, including 24% growth in Grid Technologies.
* Gas Services achieved a record quarterly profit of €412 million, with service revenue growing 20%. Grid Technologies posted a profit of €309 million, benefiting from increased volume and higher-margin orders.
* Siemens Gamesa’s revenue grew by 18%, mainly due to a 46% increase in offshore business. However, it reported a loss of €374 million, reflecting continued challenges in the onshore segment.
* Free cash flow pre-tax came in at €1.5 billion, driven by project advance payments and favorable customer payment behavior.

### Q&A
