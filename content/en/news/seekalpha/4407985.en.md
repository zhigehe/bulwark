B. Riley Securities started coverage of Sunrise Realty Trust (NASDAQ:[SUNS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SUNS "Sunrise Realty Trust, Inc.")) with a Buy rating, citing the mortgage REIT's ability to "capitalize on the increasing void being left by banks and other lenders."

Riley analyst Randy Binner considers the mREIT, focused on southeastern U.S. multifamily and hospitality properties, as "ideally positioned for CRE market dislocation with no legacy assets."

Elevated 10-year Treasury yields with reduced expectations of Fed rate cuts are challenging cap rates, impacting originations, portfolio marks, and exits for the commercial mREIT group, he wrote in a note to clients. That hurts legacy commercial mREIT portfolios.

"SUNS has no legacy assets in the portfolio to hinder performance and tie up capital deployment," Binner said.

The company is generating a blended yield of 12%â€“14%, and Riley estimates that its portfolio will likely increase to $297M at year-end 2025 and $463M at year-end 2026.

The Buy rating aligns with the average [Wall Street rating](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SUNS/ratings/sell-side-ratings " Wall Street rating ") of Buy.
