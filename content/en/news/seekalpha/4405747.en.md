Hawaiian Electric Industries (NYSE:[HE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HE "Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.")) quickly rose 10% after the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled over some questions regarding the settlement with victims regarding the Maui wildfires.

Last year, a judged [approved a $4 billion settlement](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4139534-hawaiian-electric-gains-after-judge-says-4b-wildfire-settlement-can-move-forward) with Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:[HE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HE "Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.")) and six other defendants to resolve lawsuits from hundreds of victims of the Maui wildfires in 2023. Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:[HE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HE "Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.")) will pay about $2 billion of the settlement.

The court was looking at how insurance companies can be recouped for money already paid to policyholders. The issue for the Hawaii Supreme Court was that insurance companies have already paid out more than $2 billion and want to bring separate legal actions against defendants to recoup their claims. A judge last year ruled that the insurance companies can't bring their own legal actions, known as subrogation lawsuits.

"Under the circumstances of this mass tort case, we decline to apply the made whole doctrine to the statutory lien-claim process," the Supreme Court said in a [court filing](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SCRQ-24-0000602ord.pdf " court filing ")  on Monday.
