National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Monday that President Donald Trump’s remarks a day earlier about Treasury payment irregularities weren’t about payments to bondholders but claims by Elon Musk about improper payments to contractors and grant recipients.

“The Treasury secretary has found that the controls for spending of the previous administration were unacceptable, that they were sending money out without knowing where the money was going,” Hassett told CNBC [in an interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/nec-director-kevin-hassett-on-new-metal-tariffs-trumps-reciprocal-tariff-plan-and-tax-priorities.html?&qsearchterm=Hassett). “They were sending money out without flagging what it was for.”

Trump [on Sunday told reporters](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405427-trump-says-us-may-have-less-debt-than-believed-reports) on Air Force One en route to New Orleans for the Super Bowl that the Treasury Department had a “problem” and some payments may be disregarded, raising concerns that he was referring to government debt.

“There could be a problem, you’ve been reading about that, with Treasuries,” Trump said. “That could be an interesting problem because it could be that a lot of those things don’t count. Therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought of.”

Hassett said Monday that Musk’s team claimed to have found Treasury safeguards were lacking over where payments were sent.

“They weren’t putting in a control to make sure it was appropriated, even,” he said, adding a lot will have to be done to “clean that up.”
