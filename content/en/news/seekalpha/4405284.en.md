Earnings Call Insights: Phillips Edison & Company (NASDAQ:[PECO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PECO "Phillips Edison & Company, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Jeff Edison highlighted the company’s core FFO per share growth of nearly 4% for 2024, despite significant interest expense headwinds. He noted that excluding interest rate impacts, core FFO per share growth would have been 6%.
* The company exceeded the high end of its original guidance for acquisitions, closing nearly $100 million in acquisitions in Q4 and targeting $350 million to $450 million in gross acquisitions for 2025. Edison stated, "We believe PECO offers the best opportunity for external growth within the shopping center space."
* CFO John Caulfield reported NAREIT FFO of $83.8 million or $0.61 per diluted share for Q4, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.9%. Core FFO reached $85.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share, with a 6.9% increase year-over-year.

### Outlook

* The company provided 2025 guidance for core FFO of $2.52 to $2.59 per share, reflecting a 5.1% increase over 2024 at the midpoint. Same-center NOI growth is projected at 3% to 3.5%.
* PECO reaffirmed its target of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions for 2025, with $150 million already under contract or in negotiation for Q1 and early Q2.
* Management emphasized its disciplined acquisition strategy with a target unlevered IRR of 9% on new purchases.

### Financial Results

* Same-center NOI growth for Q4 was 6.5%. Leasing spreads were strong, with comparable new rent spreads at 30.2% and renewal rent spreads at 20.8%.
* Portfolio occupancy ended the quarter at 98%, with anchor occupancy at 99% and in-line occupancy at 95%.
* The company increased liquidity to $948 million as of December 31, 2024, supported by an amended revolving credit facility extended to January 2029.
* PECO generated $72 million in net proceeds through the issuance of 1.9 million common shares during Q4.

### Q&A

* Jeffrey Spector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Asked about tenant demand and external opportunities compared to last year. CEO Jeff Edison noted, "We feel a lot better coming into this year than we did last year in terms of backlog of projects we have under contract and controlled."
* Haendel St. Juste, Mizuho: Inquired about the role of dispositions in funding acquisitions. Edison explained that dispositions would be selectively used based on market pricing and returns relative to debt or equity issuance.
* Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs: Asked about the signed-but-not-occupied spread. CFO John Caulfield mentioned that anchor activity was higher than usual, contributing to the spread, and economic occupancy will improve as new leases commence.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts showed a neutral to slightly positive tone, primarily focusing on acquisitions, retention, and market opportunities. Concerns about tenant credit and economic occupancy were raised but did not dominate.
* Management demonstrated confidence in both prepared remarks and Q&A, emphasizing pricing power, acquisition discipline, and portfolio resilience. CEO Edison consistently highlighted the company’s ability to drive long-term growth.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was more optimistic about acquisition opportunities, reflecting a stronger pipeline and market positioning.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Acquisitions guidance increased significantly, from $275 million-$325 million in Q3 to $350 million-$450 million in Q4.
* Leasing spreads for new and renewal leases remained strong, though slightly lower than the exceptional levels achieved in Q3.
* Analysts' focus shifted from operational metrics in Q3 to broader acquisition strategies and tenant retention in Q4.
* Management’s confidence in delivering long-term growth remained consistent, supported by robust internal and external growth drivers.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management acknowledged potential challenges from tenant bankruptcies, including Party City, Big Lots, and JOANN, which collectively represent only 60 basis points of annual base rent.
* Economic uncertainty, including rising tariffs and credit card delinquencies, was flagged as potential headwinds but deemed manageable given the company’s focus on necessity-based retail.
* Analysts questioned the sustainability of high leasing spreads and how economic occupancy might impact financials in 2025.

### Final Takeaway

Phillips Edison & Company delivered strong Q4 results with notable growth in FFO and operating metrics. The company’s disciplined acquisition strategy, targeting $350 million to $450 million in 2025, reflects confidence in external growth opportunities. Robust leasing spreads and high occupancy rates underscore continued demand for its grocery-anchored centers. While tenant bankruptcies and macroeconomic pressures pose challenges, management’s emphasis on necessity-based retail and long-term value creation positions PECO well for sustained performance.
