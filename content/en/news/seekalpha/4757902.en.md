**Reddit, Inc.** **(**[**RDDT**](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT)**)** reported a home-run [Q4 2024](https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/Reddit-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/) except for a sizable black dot: it missed on Wall Street’s estimates for its user growth, reeling in global daily active uniques or DAUqs of 101.7M versus the 103.1M Wall Street was looking for. The stock nosedived in reaction, taking a $6B hit, and we think this spells a buying opportunity.

The DAUq, which grew 39% Y/Y, wasn’t the result of less organic growth on the platform; instead, it was due to changes in Google’s algorithm. Basically, the platform experienced “volatility” due to a post-Thanksgiving change in Google search’s periodic algorithm, which impacted traffic, particularly impacting logged-out users, i.e., the guys who browse Reddit without signing in. While this isn’t great news, it’s a one-time hit, in our opinion. It’s not the beginning of a slower DAUq trend; in fact, CEO Steve Huffman noted on the [earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757725-reddit-inc-rddt-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript) that the traffic from search has recovered so far for the current quarter. Huffman said:

> traffic from search has recovered so far in Q1, and we’ve regained momentum.

We expect that momentum to enable a beat next quarter. Next quarter’s outlook is also telling; management is guiding for revenue between $360M-$370M versus consensus for $358.1M.

The market has now priced in Reddit’s vulnerability: Google algorithm changes, which account for roughly 40%-50% of Reddit’s traffic, with the stock price down as much as 15% in pre-market trading. But, Reddit itself has also caught the problem and is doing something about it, which is why we emphasize that this is a one-time slip-up and don’t expect to see a repeated instance where this drags down DAUq growth.

Reddit remains on our buy-list after the Q4 results; management reported 71% Y/Y revenue growth to $427.7M, comfortably topping expectations for $405M with a net income of $71M, up roughly 294% from a year ago, where it sat at $18.5M. There’s a lot more going for FY25 than the black dot the market is hung up on.

The post-earnings sell-off and estimate revisions that’ll follow make Reddit much better positioned to outperform next quarter, especially considering the stock was trading at premium multiples and priced for perfection. The stock trades at EV/Sales of 20.54 compared to the group average of around 9.0x. So, any slip-up brought the stock down crashing. Reddit is a growth stock and that comes with premium multiples, and yes, that makes the stock expensive. With that in mind, we think Reddit has a lot working in its favor to make that priced in growth materialize.

For starters, Reddit is becoming more of an industry go-to, climbing the ropes against its bigger rivals, like Meta Platforms ([META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")). The company saw a 420 basis point gross margin improvement Y/Y, with its gross margin at 92.6%. This was largely backed by higher average revenue per user in the U.S., and internationally. That number grew by 28% and 25%, respectively.

Our focus and point of optimism for Reddit is how much of the advertising budget it can capture: we think it’s a lot.

It won’t be an easy task to position itself as an industry go-to in the face of Meta’s Family of Apps and other big players like Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) or Google, who now dominate that market. However, we think it’s highly doable, and more importantly, already happening. This quarter, Reddit’s ad revenue grew +60% Y/Y, outpacing its 56% Y/Y growth in Q3, and performance ads supported over half of the company’s growth there, representing 60% of total ad revenue. In fact, ten of the company’s top 15 verticals grew 50% Y/Y this quarter, telling us that management is doing something right.

Our belief is that Reddit is uniquely positioned to take a bigger chunk of the global digital ad market, which is [estimated](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-advertising-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20digital%20advertising%20market,15.4%25%20from%202025%20to%202030.) to grow at a CAGR of 15.4% between 2025-2030. Even compared to its competition in the ad market, we think the company has more headroom for growth. Over 100,000 Subreddits exist that vary widely across different topics and spike high engagement; Reddit isn’t close to capturing its true potential scale when it comes to not only its ad business but also its DAUq growth. The capacity here for higher DAUq growth is huge. We say this in part because of its international DAUq momentum with machine translation, which drove something between 40%-50% of Q4’s international DAUq growth. Now, Reddit covers eight languages, but the number will expand in 2025 and reel in with it more international growth. The use of AI within the platform to enhance personalization, ad placement, and engagement should also be helpful to boost the numbers and the stock price.

Money on the table?
-------------------

We also don’t think the market has priced in the full positives of its potential AI data licensing deals as the AI race heats up; we discussed this in our last note on Reddit. The company was expected to generate $66.4M from its data licensing agreement with Google ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) last year and a total of $203M over the next three years for AI data licensing. This specific agreement is priced in, but the potential it points to isn’t, which, we think, is good news for investors. Reddit could rinse and repeat this kind of AI data licensing agreement with Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")). Huffman didn’t shy away from this green shoot on the call, noting that the company is talking to some big players.

What to do with the stock?
--------------------------

Investors should load up on the panic because, in our opinion, it’s unwarranted, and the positives here outweigh the negatives for FY25. We [initiated](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730658-reddit-buying-the-underdog-for-its-pace-of-growth) the stock with a buy last quarter, since which the stock is up $106% versus the S&P 500 up ~4%, as shown below, at around $104.90 per share up to $216 before Wednesday’s crash. We think investors should take advantage and add on the pullback.

Seeking Alpha





The company’s financials remain healthy: free cash flow and operating cash flow were both up from a year prior, with the former at $89.2M and the latter at $90M, showing a $107.4M improvement from a year ago. The catalysts are in place in terms of accelerating DAUq growth and ad revenue, with more headroom to grow as an underdog on the ad side of things.

This is a speed game; the sell-off will quickly reverse, potentially even during market trading a day after earnings, i.e., Thursday, and the sentiment remains positive. 13 out of the 20 sell-side analysts covering the stock are buy-rated, six are hold-rated and one is sell-rated, as shown below.
