* Unilever [press release](https://www.unilever.com/files/ir-q4-2024-full-announcement.pdf) (NYSE:[UL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UL "Unilever PLC")): FY Non-GAAP EPS of €2.98.
* Turnover of €60.8B (+2.0% Y/Y). Underlying sales growth of 4.2%, led by 2.9% volume growth.
* Underlying operating margin up 170bps to 18.4%, with gross margin up 280bps.
* Cash conversion of 106% with free cash flow of €6.9 billion; underlying ROIC up 190bps to 18.1%.
* Quarterly dividend raised by 6.1% vs Q4 2023; new €1.5 billion share buyback announced.
* "The separation of Ice Cream remains on track and we are making good progress on the key workstreams. We announce today the appointment of the Chair Designate for the demerged Ice Cream business and details of the listing structure"
* **Outlook:** "We expect underlying sales growth for full year 2025 to be within our multi-year range of 3% to 5%. Market growth slowed throughout 2024. We anticipate a slower start to 2025 with subdued market growth in the near term. We expect the market and our growth to improve during the year as price increases, reflecting higher commodity costs in 2025. We expect a more balanced split between volume and price. We anticipate a modest improvement in underlying operating margin for the full year versus 18.4% in 2024. We expect this improvement to be realised in the second half given the very strong first half comparator of 19.6%, which benefitted strongly from the combination of carry-over pricing and input cost deflation."
