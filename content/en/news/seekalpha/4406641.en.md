Foxconn Technology's ([OTCPK:FXCOF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXCOF "Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd.")) Chairman Young Liu said that the Taiwan-based company can plan its production around new U.S. tariffs, Reuters reported.

Liu, who was talking to reporters at the company's headquarters in New Taipei, noted that the company produces in the U.S. and Me

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

Soon after taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump announced and then paused until March 4 an across-the-board 25% tariff on all U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada.

"Depending on the tariffs, we will plan different production capacities accordingly," Liu noted, as per the report.

Trump wants companies to produce in the U.S. and Foxconn will make relevant "arrangements" with its partners in the country, according to Liu.

"For the company, if we don't manufacture here, we can do it there, so the impact is not too great," Liu added.

However, Liu noted that tariffs overall will not be good for the world economy and will shrink markets, the report added.

Earlier this week, the Apple ([AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) supplier — which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision ([OTCPK:HNHAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HNHAF "Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd."))
