The Thesis
----------

Powell Industries (NASDAQ:[POWL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL "Powell Industries, Inc.")) delivers another quarter with decent double-digit topline growth as it enters into the first quarter of FY25. However, despite good earnings, the market reacted unfavorably due to moderated growth versus the prior year levels, pushing the stock down further after the DeepSeek impact. But this correction has corrected the price significantly, making the valuation really attractive, considering its intact fundamentals. I expect the company's topline to continue its growth further in the rest of FY25 as the overall demand environment remains good, primarily in the commercial and industrial end market (C&I), which includes the data center sector. Capacity expansion plans are also in progress and expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth in the latter half of the year, which, along with robust [backlog levels near $1.35 billion](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript), should fuel overall topline growth in FY25 and beyond. For margin, I believe, the company's focus on excellent project execution and operational improvements should remain a key driver to support margin growth in the quarters ahead. [Since my last article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748969-powell-industries-stock-buying-opportunity-slowing-growth-fundamentals-strong), the stock is down. While there are concerns around sustained growth, the company's fundamentals remain intact. Considering these factors, I think the recent drop in the stock price presents an excellent opportunity to invest in this stock for the long term.

Last Quarter Highlights
-----------------------

Moving into 2025, POWL delivered another quarter with double-digit growth across its topline after an exceptional 2024 with nearly 45% growth in its topline for FY24. However, as we also discussed in my previous article, the growth started to moderate in the last quarter of FY24, which continued further as the company entered into FY25. In the first quarter of FY25, the company’s top line was [up approximately 24.4% year-on-year to $241.1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404762-powell-industries-gaap-eps-of-2_86-beats-by-0_25-revenue-of-241_43m-beats-by-8_81m) as the company’s core end markets including petrochemicals and oil and gas sectors experienced significant moderation in their growth dropping to mid-teens during the quarter. However, other parts of the business continued to experience strong growth due to healthy order activity during the last quarter.

POWL's quarterly revenue (Research Wise)





Although slower, the company continues to see volume growth across the business, which along with favorable pricing dynamics and improved SG&A as a percentage of revenue continued to support POWL’s margin expansion as its operating margin expanded about 140 bps year-on-year 14.7% in the first quarter of FY25. Increased operating profits also benefited the company’s bottom-line performance as its adjusted EPS jumped to [$2.86 from just $1.98 a year ago, beating the consensus estimates by a notable $0.25](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL/earnings#:~:text=EPS%20Normalized%20Actual-,%242.86%20%28Beat%20by%20%240.25%29,-EPS%20GAAP%20Actual) in the first quarter of FY25.

Outlook
-------

After a strong 2024, the company’s topline slightly moderated moving into the first quarter of 2025, as its oil and gas and petrochemical business, which accounts for nearly 55% of total revenue, experienced softer project activity. However, the commercial and industrial (C&I) end market continue to show strength, [with 80% year-on-year growth](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript) in the last quarter. I expect, while certain parts of the business are seeing growth moderation, the C&I business of the company should continue to be a major growth driver for the company in the quarter ahead due to robust demand for the company’s solutions primarily in the data center space.

In addition to this, the order activity remained robust during the quarter with a [36% increase year-on-year to $269 million.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript) While this growth was primarily led by a large domestic LNG project in the U.S. Gulf Coast during the quarter, new order project activity remains healthy across all the sectors, resulting in a slight increase of $48 million in backlog to $1.35 billion as of Q1’25 providing decent revenue visibility for FY25 and beyond.

POWL's historical Order chart (Company Presentation)





While POWL has a strong backlog and experiencing healthy order activity across most part of the business, the company continues to progress with its capacity expansion initiatives to help it facilitate the execution of its current backlog. Under this, the [remediation work is progressing as planned at the 9-acre site](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript) that the company purchased last year, and has already freed up an important capacity at its largest facility in Houston. In addition to this, the expansion and enhancement of Powell’s electrical product factory in Houston also remain on track with its [expected completion by mid-2025](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript), which should further help the company meet the growing demand across its key markets

In my view, despite a slowdown in certain end markets, the overall demand environment for the company’s solution remains strong. This, along with a robust backlog level and the company’s capacity expansion initiatives, which are anticipated to contribute to the company’s revenue in the latter half of the year, should drive topline growth in FY25 and beyond.

While the expanded capacity is expected to support the company in meeting growing demand and backlog conversions, these additional spaces are also expected to support POWL in new product development, primarily in the electric product factory. The [company’s R&D spend was also up about 26% year-on-year](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756159-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript) to further boost innovation for the development of new products with evolving market needs, which should further support the long-term demand growth for the company’s products.

Apart from this, the company remains focused on diversifying into high-growth markets like data centers. This expansion is increasing its revenue share beyond core industrial markets, and I expect this growth in this space to continue further due to rising demand for cloud computing and AI-driven workloads, which should further support the company’s future growth. In addition to this, tailwinds across the end markets, including increasing investment in grid modernization and renewable energy integration and rising global energy demand should further drive the company’s topline growth in the coming years.

Valuation
---------

I [last covered this article earlier this year in mid-January](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748969-powell-industries-stock-buying-opportunity-slowing-growth-fundamentals-strong), when the stock was trading near $221, maintaining my bullish despite the slowing growth concerns. While the stock grew significantly after that article, reaching over $310, the DeepSeek shock triggered a sharp decline in POWL's stock along with AI and tech stocks, due to its exposure to AI infrastructure and related companies. The decline continued further post [Q1'25 earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404762-powell-industries-gaap-eps-of-2_86-beats-by-0_25-revenue-of-241_43m-beats-by-8_81m) despite strong earnings beating estimates, as the market reacted to moderate growth versus the prior year. As a result, the stock is currently down by the single digits % since my last article.

However, I believe that the recent correction has significantly cooled down the stock's valuation after the rally it experienced in 2024. Currently, the company's stock is trading at a non-GAAP [forward P/E ratio of 15.22](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL/valuation/metrics#:~:text=B%2B-,15.22,-20.24), based on [FY25 EPS estimates of $13.81](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Sep%202025-,13.81,-12.37%25). In comparison with its sector median and historical averages, the stock remains at an attractive price point considering its strong double-digit forward growth as can be seen in the table below.

[![POWL Growth grade](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/59815527-17393590327013023.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/12/59815527-17393590327013023_origin.png)



POWL Growth Grade (Seeking Alpha)





Going ahead, I expect the company to benefit from robust growth primarily in the C&I end market due to continued growth in the data center space. This, along with benefits from an elevated backlog and enhanced capacity to meet strong demand, should drive topline growth in FY25 and beyond. With an expected growth in the topline, benefits from strong operational improvement driven by efficient project execution, as well as benefits from a favorable mix, should continue to support the company's margins in the quarters ahead, leading to further bottom-line expansion and further enhancement in the stock valuation in the future.

Risk
----

Similar to my previous article, slowing growth remains a key concern for the company moving forward. As I also highlighted earlier, the market reacted unfavorably to a miss against revenue estimates and moderated growth post Q4 earnings. A similar reaction occurred post Q1 FY25 earnings, as the market responded negatively to a weaker start to FY25, as the topline growth slowed to the [20% range](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404762-powell-industries-gaap-eps-of-2_86-beats-by-0_25-revenue-of-241_43m-beats-by-8_81m) compared to nearly 50% in the prior year quarter. While I am still optimistic about the company's growth prospects, if the company can't maintain its growth further into 2025 or misses the estimates in the upcoming earnings, the stock performance might get impacted negatively in the future.

Conclusion
----------

As discussed above, the company's stock is trading at an attractive discount to its historical average. The company's revenue is expected to benefit from a robust demand environment across most of the end markets, which, along with backlog, should fuel topline growth in the quarters ahead. Anticipated volume growth and benefits from operational improvements should also continue to support margins in FY25 and beyond. POWL's long-term prospects also remain intact with its focus on capacity expansion and product innovation and end market related tailwinds. Considering these factors, I still believe POWL is well positioned to continue its growth further in the coming years. Hence, I am maintaining my bullish view, giving POWL another "BUY" rating for investors with a long-term perspective.
