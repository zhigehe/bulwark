Earnings Call Insights: CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:[CBRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBRE "CBRE Group, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Bob Sulentic announced that Q4 2024 was CBRE’s best quarter ever for core earnings and free cash flow. The company achieved significant strategic milestones, including the acquisition of Industrious, leading to the consolidation of all building management businesses into the new Building Operations & Experience segment. Jamie Hodari, Industrious’ CEO, will lead this segment.
* CBRE completed the integration of its project management business with Turner & Townsend, forming a large-scale operation targeting infrastructure, energy, and data center opportunities. This combined unit is projected to drive resilient revenue growth.
* Two senior leadership changes were disclosed: Vikram Kohli was named CEO of the Advisory business, and Adam Gallistel and Andy Glanzman were appointed co-CEOs of the Investment Management business.
* CFO Emma Giamartino highlighted record revenues from resilient businesses, with net revenue growing 16% in the quarter and 14% for the year. She noted that leasing revenue rose by 15%, driven by 28% growth in U.S. office leasing, with key gateway markets like New York and Los Angeles displaying strong performance.

### Outlook

* CBRE projects core EPS for 2025 to range between $5.80 and $6.10, representing over 16% growth at the midpoint, supported by mid-teens SOP growth in resilient businesses and continued recovery in leasing and capital markets.
* Management anticipates above-trend mid-teens revenue growth in the Building Operations & Experience segment, bolstered by the Industrious acquisition. Project management revenue growth is expected to be in the low to mid-teens, with significant contributions from Turner & Townsend.
* Real Estate Investments will benefit from elevated data center activity, with monetizations contributing over half of development profits. Full-year free cash flow generation is expected to approximate $1.5 billion.

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 adjusted EPS was $2.23 vs. analysts’ estimate of $2.23. Revenue for the quarter reached $10.29 billion vs. analysts’ estimate of $10.29 billion.
* Resilient businesses, including facilities management and project management, contributed nearly 60% of 2024 SOP. Leasing revenue grew significantly, with U.S. office leasing up 28%, demonstrating improved return-to-office momentum.
* The Advisory segment achieved a 34% increase in SOP, driven by record leasing revenue and higher capital markets activity. Mortgage origination revenue rose 37%, supported by a 76% increase in origination fees.
* Free cash flow surpassed $1.5 billion for the year, with free cash flow conversion nearly reaching 100%, exceeding the company’s target range.

### Q&A

* Anthony Paolone, JPMorgan: Asked about muted recovery guidance for capital markets. CFO Emma Giamartino responded that transaction activity is still below peak levels but noted a 20% growth in U.S. sales activity early in 2025. She emphasized the cautious approach due to potential rate volatility.
* Michael Griffin, Citi: Inquired about long-term growth potential for the Turner & Townsend business. CEO Bob Sulentic projected mid-teens growth, with Turner & Townsend contributing to segments with strong tailwinds, such as data centers and green energy.
* Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley: Questioned further margin expansion opportunities in GWS. CFO Giamartino highlighted that contract profitability improvements and cost efficiency measures will support steady margin growth over the next few years.
