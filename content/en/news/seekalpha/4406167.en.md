Kestra Medical Technologies (KMTS), a developer of wearable medical devices, has filed for a proposed $100M initial public offering.

The company didn't state any terms in its SEC filing, but did indicate in a filing fee schedule that it was seeking to raise around $100M, a number that is likely a placeholder and subject to change.

Kestra (KMTS) hopes to list its shares on Nasdaq under the symbol KMTS. Bain Capital is a 5% investor in the company.

Lead bookrunners on the deal include BofA, Goldman Sachs, Piper Sandler, Wells Fargo, Stifel and Wolfe/Nomura Alliance.

Based in Kirkland, Wash., Kestra (KMTS) has developed a wearable cardioverter defibrillator to protect against sudden cardiac death.
