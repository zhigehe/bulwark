Chip stocks have had a major rude awakening in 2025, with news that China’s DeepSeek AI models may not need advanced Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) chips to build out highly functional LLMs. But while Nvidia has dominated the headlines, there’s one under-the-radar stock that deserves more of our attention, and that’s Seagate (NASDAQ:[STX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX "Seagate Technology Holdings plc")).

On paper, Seagate is a legacy technology company whose growth trajectory is nearly as exciting as a company like Nvidia which is a direct contributor to the AI revolution. However, Seagate’s technology, while secondary and not exactly groundbreaking, is a core input to AI computing: its HDD drives enable the mass storage needed to run data-hungry AI models.

Additionally, Seagate’s gains have been more modest relative to other chip stocks, with the company gaining only ~10% over the past year - in my view, investors still have a chance to get in on the ground floor here.

[I last wrote a bullish note](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746767-seagate-stock-storage-pricing-concerns-overblown-buy-dip-capture-3-3-percent-yield) on Seagate in December, when the stock was still trading closer to $87 per share. Since then, Seagate has climbed modestly higher, while its recent fiscal Q2 (November quarter) earnings results highlight continued strong growth, particularly buoyed by a resurgence in enterprise demand. Previously, I had noted that Seagate was unfairly lumped in with peers like Western Digital ([WDC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC "Western Digital Corporation")) and Micron ([MU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU "Micron Technology, Inc.")) which had far more exposure to softening NAND flash price trends. Seagate’s results, meanwhile, showed accelerating growth and margins, demonstrating that its HDD portfolio is quite healthy. With this in mind, I’m reiterating my buy rating on Seagate.

To me, the core tenets of the bull case for Seagate are as follows:

* **Seagate benefits from storage needs for data-hungry AI models.** The main requirement for training AI models is absorbing copious amounts of data, which in turn requires huge amounts of storage. Seagate’s specialization in low-cost, cold HDD storage is a perfect solution for this need.
* **Seagate’s margins continue to rise, generating healthy FCF and deleveraging the company’s debt.** Robust demand has led to solid HDD pricing, which have caused a surge in Seagate’s gross and operating margins, catalyzing the company’s overall profitability and reducing its debt levels down to normal thresholds.
* **This cheap stock also pays a dividend,** which at the time of writing is ~3%.

In my view, investors would do well to jump in on Seagate as continued robust demand for HDD fuels further earnings growth.

Let’s now go through Seagate’s latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q2 (November quarter) earnings summary is shown below:

[![Seagate Q2 results](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/28/33427965-17381116123781846.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/28/33427965-17381116123781846_origin.png)



Seagate Q2 results (Seagate Q2 earnings deck)





Seagate’s revenue jumped by an astonishing 50% y/y to $2.33 billion, ahead of Wall Street’s $2.32 billion consensus mark. Importantly as well, the company’s revenue growth accelerated sharply from 17% growth in Q1.

It’s not done here yet, either. Its guidance for Q3 calls for a rather wide range of $1.95-$2.25 billion in revenue, which would represent a 18-36% growth range. The width of that range suggests how volatile and rampant demand currently is for storage chips.

Seagate outlook (Seagate Q2 earnings deck)





A couple of core drivers are catalyzing the strong revenue trends. Enterprise demand is healthy as companies continue to prepare for data-heavy AI models. The company also notes that GenAI’s image and video generation capabilities have required huge amounts of storage. Per CEO David Mosley’s remarks on the recent [Q2 earnings call:](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4750996-seagate-technology-holdings-plc-stx-q2-2025-earnings-conference-call-transcript)

> We believe hyperscale customers are continuing to manage their inventory levels well while making infrastructure investments to support growing demand for traditional services, advertising, and e-commerce as well as emerging GenAI applications. These applications will be prolific creators of data. And given that a substantial volume of the data will be stored on HDDs, we expect GenAI to drive future mass capacity storage growth. This is particularly true of data-rich imagery and video content created by GenAI models, which is projected to expand nearly 170 times from 2024 through 2028.”

Second, we also note that customers are increasing demand for higher-capacity drives. As shown in the chart below, average capacity per drive increased 9% y/y to an average of 11.6TB.

We note as well that the SSD/Other segment declined -9% y/y, a symptom of weaker flash pricing. While this is a minor headwind to Seagate's otherwise tremendous growth rates, we think this serves to highlight further that **Seagate's exposure to SSD is minor, with this segment representing less than 10% of revenue.** Meanwhile, HDD is over half of the revenue mix of Seagate's chief rival, Western Digital.

Seagate's pro forma operating margins also expanded **15 points y/y to 23.1%**, driven by a 12-point jump in gross margin (which also improved 220bps sequentially). We note that the company's guidance for Q3 calls for a "low twenties" margin percentage, signaling that the pricing strength and gross margin upside that Seagate enjoyed in Q2 will be sustained into Q3.

Meanwhile, the company also grew cash flow at 52% y/y, which in turn has been vital in bringing down Seagate's debt as well as its leverage ratios. The company's leverage ratio against adjusted EBITDA fell to 2.5x, a reduction of 0.7x sequentially and 4.0x on a y/y basis (generally, commercial banks consider a ~3x threshold to be a "highly leveraged" company, and Seagate is now below this threshold).

Valuation and key takeaways
---------------------------

Seagate is enjoying enormous secular tailwinds from AI, which is driving incredible demand for HDD chips and enriching its margin profile. Despite these strengths, Seagate continues to trade at a deep discount against the broader market at just a ~13x forward P/E ratio, though it is at a slightly richer premium against its core peers, Micron and Western Digital.

Still, I'd argue that Seagate's slight premium is more than warranted given its minimal exposure to NAND. A company growing at >50% on both the top line and free cash flow, while paying a ~3% dividend and is trading at only a ~13x forward P/E, is a true rarity in today's market. Buy Seagate with confidence.
