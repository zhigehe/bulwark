"We expect 2025 to deliver further optimization of Shopify Audiences and Campaigns penetration across more merchants and geos. And perhaps later this year into next, we expect introductions of new marketing capabilities (and subsequent monetization) including generative AI/creative tools, bidding, channel management and budget allocation, and eventually retail media ad extension for its merchants," the research firm said Monday.

SHOP has a PT of $150, implying an upside of 27.8%.The company will report its results before the bell on Tuesday.
