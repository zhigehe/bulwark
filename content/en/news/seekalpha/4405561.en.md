Carlyle Specialty Lending Inc. (NASDAQ:[CGBD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGBD "Carlyle Secured Lending Inc.")) shares slipped 1.6% in Monday premarket trading after Bank of America Securities downgraded the business development company to Underperform from Buy, as near-term "earnings growth and overall profitability will likely disappoint investors following the completion of its merger with an affiliated private BDC (CSL3)."

Recent BDC mergers from private to public have led to short-term share price declines as new investors rebalanced their portfolios, analyst Derek Hewett explained in a note to clients.

He expects that trend to persist, as CSL3 investors have "enjoyed the benefits of a private BDC the last 2years (i.e. steady dividend growth, insulation from public market price volatility, lower fees drive an equivalent core ROE as the portfolio scaled, etc.)."

A lofty valuation adds to the analyst's case for a downgrade. CGBD traded at a roughly 10% net asset value premium relative to peers, as the stock hovered near 52-week highs.

Meanwhile, Seeking Alpha's Quant system gave CGBC a [valuation grade of A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGBD/valuation/metrics "valuation grade of A"), with its price-to-earnings ratio trailing the sector median by a wide margin.

BofA's Underperform rate diverges from the [Quant](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGBD/ratings/quant-ratings "Quant") rating and the average [sell-side analyst](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGBD/ratings/sell-side-ratings "sell-side analyst") rating, both at Hold.
