Analysts at Guggenheim downgraded their investment rating on Snapchat parent Snap Inc. (NYSE:[SNAP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNAP "Snap Inc.")) to "neutral" from "buy" on Tuesday.

The research firm believes the company has well-defined broad goals like increasing user engagement, developing more effective lower-funnel advertising, and improving brand advertising growth. However, they think the effective investment in and execution towards these goals is likely to remain elusive in 2025.

They also believe the companyâ€™s plan to invest more to be competitive drives further pressure on profitability.

"Since we see profit pressure as reflective of the need for incremental spending amidst intense competition for advertising dollars, we lower our rating," the research firm said Tuesday.

"We continue to see potential positives for the business, including a large, dedicated global user base, particularly in harder-to-reach younger demographics, and early-stage ad opportunities through Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places," the research firm added.

SNAP has PT of $11, cut from $13, implying an upside of only 2.7%.
