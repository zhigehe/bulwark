McEwen Mining (NYSE:[MUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MUX "McEwen Mining Inc.")) +3.2% in Wednesday's trading after saying its McEwen Copper subsidiary submitted a request to join an Argentina government incentive program that [could provide significant tax breaks](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19999211-los-azules-requests-admission-to-argentinas-incentive-regime-for-large-investments "could provide significant tax breaks") for its Los Azules copper project.

Once admission is approved by the government authority, Los Azules would have access to various benefits, including a drop in the corporate income tax rate to 25% from 35%, relief from value added tax payment during construction, exemption from export duties, and exclusion from the obligation to bring export proceeds into the country, the company said.

McEwen (NYSE:[MUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MUX "McEwen Mining Inc.")) said it plans to spend $2.7B on the mine, and has committed $227M under the Argentina government's Large Investment Incentive Regime to carry out the mine's feasibility study and prepare for construction, and said it could invest an additional $2.5B into the site to build the mine and production facilities under the incentives mechanism if approved.

Los Azules, one of Argentina's prime copper projects, could start construction in early 2026, pending environmental permits, a feasibility study and the tax approval, McEwen ([MUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MUX "McEwen Mining Inc.")) said.
