Earnings Call Insights: IGM Financial Inc. ([OTCPK:IGIFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGIFF "IGM Financial Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Adjusted EPS for 2024 was $3.95, reflecting a 12% increase year-over-year, marking the company’s second-highest annual performance. James O'Sullivan, President and CEO, highlighted that client assets grew by 24%, reaching $480 billion by year-end, driven by core businesses IG Wealth and Mackenzie Investments. Over $650 million was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
* IG Wealth Management reported record-high AUA of $140.4 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Gross inflows for Q4 were $3.9 billion, with net inflows of $553 million. Damon Murchison, CEO of IG Wealth Management, emphasized, "January was a strong month ending with a record AUM&A, record gross inflows, and record gross sales."
* Mackenzie Investments achieved record AUM of $213 billion, supported by $4 billion in institutional mandate wins expected to fund in Q1 2025. Luke Gould, CEO of Mackenzie Investments, also noted strong momentum in retail private asset products, with over $300 million at year-end.
* The company renewed its normal course issuer bid and repurchased $47 million in shares during Q4. CFO Keith Potter stated, "Adjusted EPS of $1.05 was up 22% year-over-year, marking the second-best fourth quarter on record."

### Outlook

* Management outlined plans to continue investing in wealth and asset management businesses for long-term growth. IG Wealth will focus on the mass affluent and high-net-worth segments, while Mackenzie aims to enhance its distribution and client experience.
* James O'Sullivan reiterated the company's M&A strategy, emphasizing, "We expect to be most focused on investing in the strategic investments that we own today."
* China AMC earnings are projected to remain flat in 2025 compared to 2024, as competitive pricing changes in ETFs are offset by expected asset growth.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 was $1.05, a 22% increase year-over-year. Total assets under management and advisement grew 12.6% year-over-year, ending the quarter at $278.1 billion.
* Mackenzie Investments experienced a significant improvement in net redemptions, reporting $377 million in Q4, compared to $826 million in the same period last year. Institutional mandate wins, totaling $4 billion, are expected to fund in early 2025.
* Wealthsimple recorded a 106% year-over-year increase in AUA, reaching record levels with $11.9 billion growth during the quarter. Rockefeller also added 54 advisers in 2024, contributing to a 24% increase in client assets.

### Q&A

* Nikolaus Priebe, CIBC: "Was the China AMC pricing change driven by competitive considerations or regulatory action?" Luke Gould responded, "These were competitive changes to retain their leading market share position. Earnings in Q1 should be slightly down from Q4."
* Tom MacKinnon, BMO: "Will the $5 million share buyback reduce the share count?" James O'Sullivan confirmed, "That’s exactly what we aim to do, increasing the capital returned to shareholders in 2025."
* Graham Ryding, TD Securities: "What drives Mackenzie's investments in product and distribution capabilities?" Luke Gould explained, "We’re enhancing client experiences through adviser web access and back-office improvements."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns over the impact of pricing changes at China AMC and sought clarity on growth drivers in Wealthsimple and Mackenzie. The tone was neutral, with a focus on competitive positioning.
* Management's sentiment during prepared remarks was confident, emphasizing records achieved and growth strategies. However, during the Q&A, responses were slightly defensive when addressing China AMC and Mackenzie's fee rate dynamics.
* Compared to the previous quarter, analysts maintained a similar tone, while management displayed increased confidence in its strategic investments and high-net-worth client penetration.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Adjusted EPS grew from $1.03 in Q3 to $1.05 in Q4, reflecting a sequential increase. Asset growth rates in all core businesses were consistent, while Q4 saw record inflows at IG Wealth and Wealthsimple.
* Strategic focus remained on high-net-worth clients, with IG Wealth increasing penetration in this segment, now representing 44% of total AUA, up from 43% in Q3.
* Analysts’ focus shifted slightly from Wealthsimple’s valuation to Mackenzie’s institutional wins and fee rate impacts.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management flagged potential market volatility in 2025, tied to geopolitical events like tariffs impacting Canada and Mexico.
* Analysts questioned the sustainability of earnings at China AMC given recent fee reductions.
* Fee rate pressure at Mackenzie was highlighted as a concern, particularly in relation to institutional mandates and retail fund performance.

### Final Takeaway

IGM Financial delivered a strong Q4, marked by record-high assets and significant growth across its core businesses. The company is focused on long-term investments in wealth and asset management, particularly targeting high-net-worth clients and enhancing its institutional capabilities.
