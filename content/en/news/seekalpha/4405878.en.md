When it comes to AI investing, much of the market's attention has been focused on Big Tech players such as Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")), Alphabet ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")).

But what about companies that provide goods or services that could utilize or complement AI? **What are the most attractive AI-adjacent stocks right now?**

We asked Seeking Alpha analysts **[Tech Stock Pros](https://seekingalpha.com/author/tech-stock-pros)**, **[Michael Wiggins De Oliveira](https://seekingalpha.com/author/michael-wiggins-de-oliveira)** and **[Brett Ashcroft Green](https://seekingalpha.com/author/brett-ashcroft-green)** for their thoughts.

**[Tech Stock Pros:](https://seekingalpha.com/author/tech-stock-pros)** This year is setting out to be a rollercoaster for AI stocks, but that's not synonymous with a bad year for AI.

The way we see it, there are winners on the periphery of AI on the semi-front. The first that come to mind are the earliest players in the semi-supply chain: ASML (NASDAQ:[ASML](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML "ASML Holding N.V.")), Lam Research (NASDAQ:[LRCX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX "Lam Research Corporation")) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:[AMAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT "Applied Materials, Inc.")).

ASML's (NASDAQ:[ASML](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML "ASML Holding N.V.")) +90% share of the lithography market, backed by its EUV dominance, makes it the industry go-to and necessary to uphold Moore's Law. Regardless of DeepSeek's impact on AI infrastructure spend, we believe AI and even endpoint products like smartphones will have to move to smaller nanometers, which require EUV tools. LRCX (NASDAQ:[LRCX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX "Lam Research Corporation")) and AMAT (NASDAQ:[AMAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT "Applied Materials, Inc.")) also stand to benefit on the etch and deposition front.

Fortinet's (NASDAQ:[FTNT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTNT "Fortinet, Inc.")) integration of AI into its SecOps FotinAI and FortiGuard AI should reap more benefits, especially with leverage in its FortiASIC tech that accelerates SASE function for superior performance and competitive pricing.

While Adobe (NASDAQ:[ADBE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADBE "Adobe Inc.")) stands out as an attractive value pick with AI exposure, i.e., AI monetization, that has yet to show up on financials and low enough expectations to enable an outperform.

[**Michael Wiggins De Oliveira:**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/michael-wiggins-de-oliveira) Every investor seems to be chasing the hottest AI stocks right now. But with all the uncertainty, it’s smarter to back the clear winner—the elephant in the room—rather than gambling on the ''next big thing".

What makes a business a clear AI winner? This is an easier question to answer. A business that beyond all the corporate narrative and hype you can see strong, predictable and accelerating growth rates. When a company steadily grows its free cash flow, investors follow and the share price naturally rises. That’s just how it works.

Don't get too caught chasing what is the most attractive idea. Instead, kill the noise. Focus on the next tech titan, Palantir (NASDAQ:[PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")). This is a business that everyone either believes they've already missed the boat on or that it's overvalued.

I charge that investors get too confused chasing things that don't matter. Investors often waste time dwelling on where a company has been rather than where it's headed. Stay focused on what truly matters.

[**Brett Ashcroft Green:**](https://seekingalpha.com/author/brett-ashcroft-green) As a value investor, I’m usually most attracted to sectors that have underperformed. After figuring out what has underperformed in the past few years, where are the opportunities? AI-adjacency, or those that will benefit from rather than produce AI products in-house themselves, would have to be healthcare.

The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ([XLV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLV "Health Care Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")) has only had a total return of 17.76% over the past 3 years. The large stalwart healthcare names are not doing much in-house R&D anymore, but rather making strategic acquisitions. AI should help smaller biotechs make more breakthroughs than ever, and the same goes for medtech. This should make for better acquisition targets.

The cash-rich large-cap healthcare names that have a lot of borrowing capacity will be able to buy better and better bolt-on acquisitions. While I am not one to pick pre-profit biotech names, I am confident there will be more and more breakthroughs in that subsector. Sitting on the best large-cap healthcare names that are best positioned to make acquisitions seems like the best play when looking for something AI-adjacent.

I really like a company like Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:[JNJ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ "Johnson & Johnson")) for where it’s valued and its leverage capacity by having an AAA credit rating. After spinning off Kenvue ([KVUE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KVUE "Kenvue Inc.")), they are now squarely focused on medicine and medtech.
