French startup Mistral AI and German security AI company Helsing are collaborating to jointly develop next-generation AI systems for the defense of Europe.

The companies [unveiled](https://helsing.ai/newsroom/helsing-and-mistral-announce-strategic-partnership-in-defence-ai "unveiled") the partnership on Monday at the start of the Paris Global AI Summit. The partnership combines Helsing’s expertise in AI-powered military technology, including its Ukraine-deployed strike drones or Eurofighter electronic warfare capabilities, with Mistral’s generative AI models, to enhance human-AI collaboration on the battlefield, according to the companies.

The development work will focus on Vision-Language-Action models, enabling defense platforms to understand their environment, communicate naturally with operators, and allow for faster, more reliable decisions in complex scenarios, the companies noted.

"Mistral AI’s versatile models are instrumental in developing a new generation of defense systems, ensuring Europe's strategic advantage in the global landscape," said Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral — which is in part [backed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4071598-microsoft-teams-up-with-mistral-to-bring-start-ups-ai-model-on-azure#hasComeFromMpArticle "backed") by Microsoft (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")).

Last week, Stellantis N.V. and Mistral [announced](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404999-stellantis-strengthens-strategic-partnership-with-mistral-ai-to-enhance-vehicle-development "announced") a collaboration to integrate AI across multiple areas, from vehicle engineering to in-car experiences.
