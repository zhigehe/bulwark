GE Vernova (NYSE:[GEV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GEV)) said Tuesday it will [close its wind turbine blade factory](https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/ge-vernova-closing-wind-blade-factory-with-1-000-jobs-to-go/2-1-1777552) in the Brazilian city of Suape due to weakening demand in the Latin American market, affecting ~1,000 workers.

Workers were told the plant will close as soon as next month when the last blades on the production line are concluded, according to local news media.

The plant was acquired by GE in 2017, and the company has since gone on the retreat in Brazil, announcing in 2022 it would suspend production of new wind turbines in the country; in 2023, Siemens Gamesa also halted its wind turbine factory in Bahia state.

Installation of new wind farms fell by more than 30% in 2024 in Brazil to 3.3 GW, according to industry group ABEEolica, which expects the unfavorable scenario to persist until 2026.
