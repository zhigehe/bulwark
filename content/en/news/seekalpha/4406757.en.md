Ryder Systems (NYSE:[R](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R "Ryder System, Inc.")) realized a 17% improvement in profits in the [fourth quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406713-ryder-gives-mixed-q4-results-provides-2025-outlook "fourth quarter") with double-digit earnings growth in each of its segments as revenue was up 5% from a year ago despite ongoing freight market headwinds. This is the first quarter in the last eight with year-over-year comparable growth, yet shares are only treading water into Wednesday’s open as the 5% gain in revenue was short of Wall Street’s [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R/earnings "expectations").

“Our ability to generate ROE of 16% during this extended freight cycle downturn continues to demonstrate consistent execution and the resilience of our transformed business model,” Ryder CEO Robert Sanchez said.

By segment, Supply Chian Solutions delivered record Q4 earnings which benefited from higher volumes and optimization efforts in Ryder’s (NYSE:[R](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R "Ryder System, Inc.")) omnichannel retail vertical. In Fleet Management Solutions, lease earnings growth more than offset headwinds in rental and used vehicle sales, resulting in pretax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue of 11.6%. Dedicated Transportation Solutions also delivered record fourth-quarter earnings reflecting strong performance in Ryder’s (NYSE:[R](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R "Ryder System, Inc.")) legacy business and the Cardinal acquisition.

For 2025, Ryder ([R](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R "Ryder System, Inc.")) expects “positive momentum” in its contractual business to continue into 2025, contributing to higher earnings in all business segments. Revenue is expected to grow by ~2%, translating into $12.85B, below the [consensus estimate](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/R/earnings/estimates " consensus estimate ") of $13.62B. EPS is targeted to be within a range of $13.00 to $14.00, straddling estimates of $13.46 per share.

Additionally, ROE is expected to be between 17% and 18% and net free cash flow of $300M to $400M.
