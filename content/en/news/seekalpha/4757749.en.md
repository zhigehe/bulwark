Restaurant operations have changed significantly over the last decade, with the pandemic offering a chance to reinvent the entire sector as consumer needs and demands evolved. With digital systems increasingly used, companies such as Toast (NYSE:[TOST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST "Toast, Inc.")) have built out incredibly sophisticated all-in-one software systems via the cloud, including payment platforms, which effectively streamline the entire operation for a business. With [127,000](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107524847/en/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results) locations now using these systems, and rapidly growing revenues, Toast is cemented as a fairly critical part of the foodservice industry. However, from an investment perspective, after a [141%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST) rise in a year, I fear that the share price is now beyond my estimate of fair value. With competition moving in, and high expectations for the coming years, I think there might be some caution merited for investors, so I'll be starting a hold rating on the shares.

TOST Overview (Seeking Alpha)





A Strong and Scalable Business Model
------------------------------------

[Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/uk/) functions as an integrated fintech and SaaS platform for restaurants, enabling a huge range of efficiencies and additional features. Unlike traditional point-of-sales (POS) systems, the platform is a fully connected ecosystem, linking front-of-house, back-of-house, and payment processing to provide a reliable overview for restaurant operators.

The majority of [revenues](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/earnings) come from financial technology solutions, with subscription services and hardware making up the rest. The company sees major returns from a high-recurring revenue model, which enables stable and predictable cash flows from a growing number of clients across the U.S.

TOST Revenues (TipRanks)





The firm generally works with small and medium-sized chains, but looks to be pushing towards some major enterprise deals over the coming years. With new partnerships with brands such as Potbelly ([PBPB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBPB "Potbelly Corporation")), Choice Hotels ([CHH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHH "Choice Hotels International, Inc.")), and Marriott ([MAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAR "Marriott International, Inc.")), there could be some potentially lucrative opportunities for high-margin, scalable revenue streams.

Innovation is clearly at the heart of the company, with a major focus on building digital capabilities such as AI-driven tools for gathering customer insights. Named [Sous Chef,](https://www.semafor.com/article/07/26/2024/toast-ceo-aman-narang-on-the-ai-enabled-restaurants-of-the-future) it looks to help management across all types of business to improve operations, and consider a range of areas which may not be on the radar.

> *"With this tool called Sous Chef [an AI chat assistant], we give them really easy insights on three, four or five things you should really consider or pay attention to, or change or factor in as you think about your operations. It could be things like what to put on menus for concepts that are very popular in your zip code, how to think about inflation trends, how to think about pricing."*
> 
> - Toast co-founder, Aman Narang

This feels to me like a natural extension of the platform, especially in the current landscape where AI is almost expected to be built into most software systems.

Building out this product and taking it to new markets will also be an enormous opportunity. Toast has entered the Canadian, UK, and Irish markets recently, and while these are still at fairly small scale, it demonstrates an ability to grow and build out the company's footprint.

The Bear Case: Challenges and My Valuation Concerns
---------------------------------------------------

Despite an encouraging growth story, I feel that there are a few challenges which warrant a cautious stance with an investment here. With the company's Price/Book now at about [16](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/valuation/metrics), it's being priced as a high-growth SaaS firm. While there is some truth to this, the [guidance](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx) being issues seems to be far from what the market might be expecting for a company of this type. Despite consistently missing estimates, analysts are expecting the company to see [enormous growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/earnings) over the next year in EPS, which I just have a tough time seeing in reality.

[![eps](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/27/50978666-17379820593734324.png)](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/1/27/50978666-17379820593734324_origin.png)

Competition also poses significant risks to these estimates, with primary rival Block ([XYZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ "Block, Inc.")) deeply entrenched in the digital payments space far beyond just restaurants. Toast may struggle to compete if competition is able to scale and utilise innovative technology at a more appealing rate, especially as the economy looks to be moving into an uncertain period.

I've also got my concerns about the level of [insider selling](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tost/insider-trading) going on with Toast stock. While this can be unrelated to future confidence or performance, it does not demonstrate that shares are at a bargain level to be starting a position at.

TOST Insider Sales (TipRanks)





To establish where the intrinsic value of shares might be at the current level, I've considered the relative value, based on the P/S of [4.8](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/valuation/metrics) and EV/OCF of [70,](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/tost/relative-valuation) far higher than the long-term average of the company at 32, and the industry's average of just 6.0. This is based on the market capitalisation of [$22.9 billion](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/) and operating cash flow of [$305 million](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/tost/relative-valuation). This estimate suggests a fair value of about $28, 30% below the current level. Clearly, this reflects some major downside risk for investors. I have major concerns if the company can meet market expectations in the near term.

The Bull Case: Strong Growth and Market Tailwinds
-------------------------------------------------

Operationally, the company is demonstrating some impressive growth, with annual recurring revenue at [$1.6 billion](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), up a solid [28%](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx) in the last year. Gross payment volume also climbed [24%](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), and GAAP net income turned positive to [$56 million](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx). Most impressively, the adjusted Q3 EBITDA for the firm soared from [$35 million](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx) to [$113 million](https://investors.toasttab.com/news/news-details/2024/Toast-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx) in a year, showing a serious ability to scale profits, which was once a major investor concern.

As I noted, the entire restaurant sector is in the midst of an enormous shift towards digitalisation, with huge opportunities in digital payments, automation, and AI-driven insights. With strong relationships with customers and brands, the company can definitely play a critical role in the development of this over the coming years, as long as it can demonstrate a competitive moat to keep out rivals in the wider digital payments space.

Wall Street seems to generally like what it sees, noting an ability to capitalise on emerging trends, and with robust fundamentals. With a general [buy](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/ratings/sell-side-ratings) rating, but a price target only [1%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOST/ratings/sell-side-ratings) or so above the current level, I think analysts are roughly in line with my thesis that the company is doing all the right stuff, but potentially is already reflecting most of the eventual benefits in the share price.

TOST Ratings (Seeking Alpha)





Great Company, But a High Price Tag
-----------------------------------

Overall, I'd say Toast is undoubtedly a quality business, with strong growth potential, a robust customer base, and an excellent platform, but I think the current valuation merits concern. While there may be long-term value in an investment here, I see the next few years as fairly uncertain. If enterprise deals can be expanded upon, and international scalability proves to be a success, then the company can expect to do very well, but as an investor, it falls outside my comfort zone for now. I'll be monitoring the situation, but for now, I'll be initiating a hold rating on the stock.
