### Management View

* CEO Todd DeBonis highlighted that Q4 revenue aligned with guidance, driven by sequential growth in home and enterprise segments, while mobile revenue faced anticipated product transitions. Gross margin expanded over 340 basis points sequentially and nearly 1,000 basis points year-over-year, reflecting improved product mix and cost efficiencies.
* The TrueCut Motion platform achieved significant milestones, including agreements with Walt Disney Studios and Universal Pictures, with five major theatrical releases in 2024. The company is targeting to double the number of titles in 2025 and is in discussions with three leading device brands for incorporating TrueCut Motion capabilities.
* The Shanghai subsidiary initiated a new framework for ASIC design services, potentially contributing to revenue growth by mid-2025. The company is also exploring IP licensing agreements for use in other products, which could provide high-margin upside.
* A potential multi-million-dollar order for a legacy transcoding chip, previously end-of-life, is under evaluation, with favorable initial assessments for production feasibility.
* CFO Haley Aman noted Q4 revenue of $9.1 million. Gross margin improved to 54.8%, up from 51.3% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined to $10.4 million, and net loss narrowed to $4.3 million from $7.1 million in Q3. Cash and cash equivalents ended at $23.6 million. The company highlighted further cost reduction measures and expects a 10% reduction in operating expense run rates by Q2 2025.

### Outlook

* Management expects Q1 2025 revenue between $7 million and $8 million, reflecting seasonal trends and a slight recovery in mobile revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 49% and 51%, with operating expenses expected in the $10 million to $11 million range. Non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges between a loss of $0.13 and $0.10 per share.
* The Shanghai subsidiary is projected to achieve profitability for the full year 2025, supported by cost reductions and anticipated top-line growth.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue of $9.1 million compared to $9.5 million in Q3. Home and enterprise revenue contributed $8.5 million, while mobile revenue was $550,000. Gross margin improved to 54.8%, supported by favorable product mix.
* Non-GAAP net loss was $4.3 million, narrowing from $7.1 million in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $3.6 million compared to negative $6.3 million in the prior quarter.

### Q&A

* Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital, asked about mobile revenue recovery in 2025. CEO DeBonis responded that growth is expected through the year, potentially reaching 2023 levels on the high end. The new graphics acceleration solution is anticipated to contribute over 50% of mid- to low-end mobile revenue.
* Tyler Anderson, Craig Hallum, inquired about TrueCut tipping points for adoption by streaming services. DeBonis noted the importance of simultaneous commitments by device manufacturers and streaming platforms, with critical mass likely achieved in double-digit tentpole titles.

* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing progress in cost reductions, TrueCut adoption, and strategic initiatives.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue decreased from $9.5 million in Q3 to $9.1 million in Q4, primarily due to continued mobile headwinds.
* Gross margin improved from 51.3% in Q3 to 54.8% in Q4, driven by better product mix.
