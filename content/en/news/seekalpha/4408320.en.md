The operating margin reached 48%. The success was largely attributed to the performance of "Terrifier 3," which grossed over $54 million domestically.
* McGurk highlighted a strategic shift toward leasing and marketing theatrical films utilizing Cineverse's unique media assets. He stated that "Terrifier 3" demonstrated the effectiveness of hyper-targeted marketing strategies with minimal spend, which has led to a surge in new film opportunities.
* The company unveiled a strong pipeline of films, including "Silent Night, Deadly Night," "Toxic Avenger," and "Wolf Creek Legacy."

* Streaming and digital revenue increased by 48%, and podcast and other revenue grew by 138% year-over-year.
