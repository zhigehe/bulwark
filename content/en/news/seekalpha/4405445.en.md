Kosmos Energy (NYSE:[KOS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOS "Kosmos Energy Ltd.")) on Monday said that the first liquified natural gas (LNG) production has been achieved at the BP-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) LNG project, offshore Mauritania & Senegal.

On December 31, 2024, gas from the first phase of GTA started to flow from wells to the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel as part of the commissioning process.

Gas has now been delivered to the floating LNG vessel and liquefaction has commenced, Kosmos Energy (NYSE:[KOS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOS "Kosmos Energy Ltd.")) added.

In addition, BP ([BP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP "BP p.l.c.")) has given notice to the off-taker (BP Gas Marketing ltd.) for an LNG carrier to arrive later this quarter to export the first LNG cargo. Lifting of the first LNG cargo is when Kosmos ([KOS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOS "Kosmos Energy Ltd.")) starts to recognize revenue and generate cash flow from the project.
