Earnings Call Insights: Gladstone Capital (NASDAQ:[GLAD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLAD "Gladstone Capital")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* Bob Marcotte, President, highlighted $152M in new fundings for the quarter, including six new portfolio companies. Exits and prepayments spiked to $165M, driven by a $64M equity gain on ARA. Total debt investments increased by $45M during the quarter.
* Investment income for the period declined to $22M due to a reduction in SOFR rates and a decrease in the weighted average portfolio yield to 13.1%. Net investment income increased to $11.2M, supported by lower interest costs and a surge in origination fee credits.
* Nicole Schaltenbrand, CFO, reported total assets of $815M as of December 31, 2024, with $799M in investments at fair value. Net assets rose to $480M, resulting in a NAV per share increase to $21.51 from $21.18 in the prior quarter.
* David Gladstone, CEO, emphasized strong portfolio performance, which generated net investment income and realized gains of $69M, supporting the company’s consistent distributions and lifting NAV per share by 12% year-over-year.

### Outlook

* Management expects elevated levels of portfolio exits and repayments to persist for the next one to two quarters. They are focused on the timely redeployment of exit proceeds to maintain the investment asset base.
* Bob Marcotte indicated that new originations closed at a weighted average spread above 700 basis points over SOFR and a leverage of 3.4x EBITDA. The company continues to see attractive financing opportunities in the lower middle market.
* The company plans to refinance its 7.25% baby bonds in September 2025 to reduce borrowing costs and support additional growth in earning assets.

### Financial Results

* Total investment income declined by $1.8M to $22M due to lower SOFR rates and a decrease in portfolio yield. Other income rose to $600,000.
* Total expenses declined by $2M quarter-over-quarter, driven by a $1.7M reduction in net management fees and a $700,000 decrease in interest expenses.
* Net realized gains totaled $58M, contributing to $15.9M in net realized and unrealized gains, lifting the quarterly ROE to over 22%.
* The company foreclosed on EG's, a regional QSR, and initiated operational restructuring, including cost reductions and management changes, with plans to return the investment to performing status or sell it.
* Distributions for January, February, and March were maintained at $0.165 per share, reflecting an annualized yield of approximately 7%.

### Q&A

* Mickey Schleien, Ladenburg Thalmann, inquired about the company’s investment in the restaurant sector. Bob Marcotte responded that the bar for restaurant investments is high, with a focus on sustainable margins, disciplined leverage, and efficient cost structures. He noted that the company is unlikely to significantly increase restaurant exposure.
* Schleien also asked if the company would consider investing in more liquid credits. Marcotte stated that this was unlikely due to low marginal returns and limited control over covenant structures in larger liquid credits.
* Robert Dodd, Raymond James, questioned the timeline for resolving EG's restructuring. Marcotte estimated six months but expressed hope for a quicker resolution.
* Dodd asked about reaching the target leverage of one-to-one. Marcotte explained that while robust origination activity supports this goal, repayment activity and cost considerations may delay achieving it until late 2025.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the company’s ability to sustain strong origination activity and manage portfolio turnover. Concerns centered on the timeline for resolving distressed assets and achieving leverage targets.
* Management maintained a slightly positive tone during the call, emphasizing disciplined investment practices and operational improvements. Confidence was evident in remarks about maintaining distribution levels and navigating market challenges.
* Compared to the prepared remarks, management’s tone in Q&A was more defensive when addressing questions about distressed assets and liquidity deployment in liquid credits.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* A comparison to the previous quarter was not available due to the absence of the prior period transcript.

### Risks and Concerns

* The company highlighted risks associated with distressed assets, including EG's, and the need for operational restructuring to restore performance.
* Analysts raised concerns about exposure to tariffs and the auto market, where supply chain disruptions and regulatory changes could create stress for some investments.
* Management noted plans to refinance higher-cost liabilities, which could mitigate some risks associated with cost pressures.

### Final Takeaway

Gladstone Capital highlighted strong new originations and robust realized gains during the quarter, while maintaining a focus on disciplined investment practices in the lower middle market. Management expects elevated portfolio turnover in the near term and plans to mitigate cost pressures through refinancing. The company remains confident in its ability to sustain high distribution yields and capitalize on growth-oriented opportunities despite market challenges and distressed asset exposure.
