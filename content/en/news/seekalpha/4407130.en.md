Earnings Call Insights: Wallenius Wilhelmsen ASA ([OTCPK:WAWIF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WAWIF "Wallenius Wilhelmsen ASA")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Lasse Kristoffersen highlighted strong performance across all business segments, with a quarterly EBITDA of $452 million and a record annual adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion. He emphasized a landmark $8.9 billion in announced contracts, including a $1.2 billion renewal with Hyundai/Kia, which increases transported volume by 50%.
* The company declared a total dividend payout of $1.85 per share for 2024, representing approximately 73% of net profits. For the second half of 2024 alone, dividends equaled 95% of net profits, including an extraordinary dividend of $0.59 per share.
* CFO Jermund Lien noted, "2024 was another exceptional year by just about all measures... Group EBITDA grew by 5% year-over-year." He also highlighted an all-time high return on capital employed of 19.9%.

### Outlook

* Management expects 2025 EBITDA to be at least in line with 2024, supported by a robust book of business. CEO Kristoffersen stated confidence in sustaining high utilization rates despite an anticipated 10% annual fleet growth over the next two years.
* The company aims to expand its logistics footprint, renew major contracts, and focus on operational efficiency, particularly in energy cost reductions.
* Kristoffersen emphasized, "We are continuing our work to reduce our costs and in particular the cost of energy and the energy efficiency."

### Financial Results

* Q4 2024 revenue was $1.341 billion, flat quarter-over-quarter, while EBITDA decreased to $452 million due to lower shipping volumes and one-off accounting adjustments.
* Net freight rates reached a record $64 per cubic meter, supported by contract renewals and trade optimization.
* Operating cash flow for Q4 stood at $413 million, with net debt increasing to $1.758 billion following dividend payouts and voluntary debt repayments.
* The logistics segment achieved $1.2 billion in annual revenue, with EBITDA nearing $200 million. Government services recorded a notable $183 million EBITDA for the year, reflecting a 41% improvement year-over-year.

### Q&A

* Anders-Redigh Karlsen: "Why haven't you used the dividend policy to its full extent earlier?" CEO Kristoffersen: "We have built a stronger balance sheet... now in a financial situation where we can start paying substantial dividends."
* Karlsen: "What impact could tariffs have on logistics operations?" Kristoffersen: "While activity levels in Mexico may be affected, the EBITDA impact is expected to be less than $10 million."
* Karlsen: "Do customers meet cargo commitments?" Kristoffersen: "We have contracts obliging customers to deliver, but we remain flexible with timing and adjustments if needed."
* Karlsen: "Can you comment on fleet capacity and optionality?" CFO Lien: "We anticipate 60% to 70% loan-to-value financing for newbuilds." CEO Kristoffersen added, "We are done with ordering vessels for delivery up to 2028."

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed concerns over potential tariff impacts and fleet capacity amid increasing global uncertainties. Their tone ranged from neutral to slightly negative, focusing on operational risks and macroeconomic challenges.
* Management maintained a confident tone, particularly about high utilization and a strong book of business. CEO Kristoffersen frequently referenced the company's unique market position and resilience.
* The tone during prepared remarks was more optimistic compared to the Q&A session, where management addressed tariff-related uncertainties and fleet expansion with caution.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 EBITDA of $452 million marked a decline from Q3’s $503 million due to lower shipping volumes and one-time accounting adjustments. However, net rates improved further, reaching $64 per cubic meter.
* Dividend payouts increased significantly in Q4, reflecting the company’s improved financial position. In contrast, Q3 saw heightened focus on fleet upsizing and newbuild investments.
* Analysts' focus shifted from contract renewals in Q3 to geopolitical risks and tariff impacts in Q4. Management maintained consistent confidence in its strategies.

### Risks and Concerns

* The company highlighted potential risks from new tariffs, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, which could disrupt supply chains and reduce production volumes.
* Management acknowledged a sharp 10% annual fleet growth in 2025 and 2026, which may pressure market dynamics. However, Kristoffersen noted a strong book of business and high contract coverage as mitigating factors.
* Analysts raised concerns about customers meeting cargo commitments and the potential renegotiation of terms, but management assured that contracts remain robust and balanced.

### Final Takeaway

Wallenius Wilhelmsen delivered another record year in 2024, supported by strong contract renewals and operational efficiency. While geopolitical uncertainties and fleet expansion pose challenges, management expects high utilization and sustained profitability in 2025. With a robust book of business and strategic focus on energy efficiency, the company is positioned for continued growth and shareholder returns.
