MGM Resorts (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) ripped a big gain on Thursday after the company revealed some positive trends alongside its Q4 earnings report.

The casino operator said December was its highest convention booking month on record, and noted that it saw revenue growth in its Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations in January, as well as strong future bookings.

During the earnings call, MGM (NYSE:[MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) management highlighted that its Las Vegas December slot handle and slot win were at record levels for any month. The read on Macau traffic was also positive, with both properties recording strong traffic, about 18% higher than Chinese New Year a year ago.

MGM Resorts ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) also pointed out that its deal with Marriott International ([MAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAR "Marriott International, Inc.")) has surpassed expectations, with over 660,000 room nights stayed in 2024 and higher spending in leisure package rooms. "Importantly, we see further runway to grow in 2025 since all of our properties will be live for a full year of bookings," stated CEO Bill Hornbuckle.

There was also an interesting update on Japan. Completion of ground preparation for the casino resort complex is targeted for this year. An official groundbreaking ceremony in Osaka is scheduled for April 24.

CBRE Equity Research John DeCree and his team kept a bullish view on MGM Resorts ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) after taking in the earnings and guidance update. DeCree said MGM ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) has built a compelling growth story over the next decade, with BetMGM inflecting in 2025, MGM Digital poised to add upwards of $200 milion of incremental EBITDA over the next five years or less, and the key developments in Japan seen extending the growth pipeline beyond this decade. The firm thinks investors can be enthusiastic about MGM due to its solid fundamental outlook in the core domestic and Macau businesses, aggressive share repurchase program, and bargain valuation.

Mizuho Securities boosted his price target on MGM Resorts ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")) to $60 from $56 while maintaining an Outperform rating. Jefferies reiterated a Buy rating on MGM ([MGM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM "MGM Resorts International")).
