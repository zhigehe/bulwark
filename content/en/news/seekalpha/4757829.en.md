Investment environment
----------------------

* The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (“Index”) weakened as a strong U.S. dollar, geopolitical tensions, and fears of U.S. tariffs pressured emerging market shares.
* Brazilian equities were notable detractors from Index returns, as investor anxiety about government fiscal policies sent the real currency and equity prices lower. Stocks in Taiwan outperformed.

Portfolio review
----------------

Relative performance benefited from our long-term holding Accton Technology. This Taiwanese company is a pioneer in "white box," or unbranded, networking equipment that utilizes off-the-shelf, standardized components and offers a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to branded equipment. The stock rose as the company reported better- than-expected revenue growth for the third quarter. Accton has seen surging demand for its networking equipment to support the deployment of generative artificial intelligence (AI). We believe AI-related investment will be a strong driver of networking equipment sales over the next few years, benefiting companies such as Accton Technologies.

Relative performance also benefited from a position in Full Truck Alliance ([YMM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YMM "Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd.")), a company that we view as essentially the Uber for freight transportation in China. Full Truck Alliance is digitizing China’s long-haul truck industry through a technology platform that matches trucking capacity with shipping needs. The result has been full truckloads, reduced transportation costs, and higher trucker incomes, as well as increased logistics efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. We continue to like Full Truck Alliance’s business model and strong competition position as a dominant industry player with a 90% market share. The company reported solid financial performance despite a difficult economic backdrop, and these results have given us added confidence in its ability to monetize its business model, strengthen its competitive positioning, and grow its earnings.

Relative detractors included electronics manufacturer Samsung Electronics ([OTCPK:SSNLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.")), a major global supplier of semiconductors. The company reported very strong third-quarter earnings, but operating profits lagged expectations. The company also faced concerns over its weaker relative competitive positioning in the market for high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI. Despite these concerns, we continue to see long-term opportunity for Samsung, including in the memory market. We are also optimistic that Samsung can make progress in qualifying as an HBM supplier for NVIDIA and other AI component-makers.

Allegro.eu ([OTCPK:ALEGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALEGF "Allegro.eu S.A.")) was a relative detractor. This online retailer owns a shopping platform in Poland and e-commerce websites in Europe. The stock declined even though the company reported strong sales growth for its domestic retailing business in Poland, as well as 30% year-over-year growth in advertising revenues. Despite these results, the company faced broader earnings headwinds as it accelerated its investments in international markets. The company’s international business also faced margin pressures and inventory issues. Despite some near-term uncertainty for Allegro.eu’s broader European business, we believe the company's increased investments will help support higher sustainable, long-term earnings potential.

Manager outlook
---------------

We remain excited about positive developments that support investing in the emerging markets. These include technological innovation, rising incomes, and an expanding middle class. We also believe the restructuring of global supply chains could provide a long-term economic tailwind for countries such as Mexico and Vietnam. In the near term, however, we recognize potential changes in global trade policy may complicate these longer-term supply chain shifts. This risk increased after the U.S. election, given President-elect Trump’s threatened tariffs on U.S. imports from China, Mexico, and other countries. While it remains to be seen what policies will be implemented, this rhetoric led to equity market declines in Mexico and other countries. Brazil also experienced a notable market decline as the country’s fiscal trajectory worsened. Brazil’s central bank has been forced to aggressively raise policy rates to support the real currency, which has complicated an already challenged economic outlook. The portfolio remains underweight in Brazil, where we expect continued pressure on investments until the government gets its fiscal house in order. That said, the recent sell-offs in countries such as Mexico and Brazil have left stocks trading at very discounted valuations that may provide attractive entry points, as we start to see fiscal, economic, and trade policy risks recede. As always, our focus will remain on high-quality companies with demonstrated profitability, well-positioned franchises, and a commitment to strong corporate governance.

We also remain on the lookout for investment opportunities in Asia. While we have continued to see positive long-term trends in India, we believe valuations there appear less attractive on a relative basis, especially as economic growth has been weaker than expected. The strategy remains underweight in China. Despite incremental measures, the Chinese government has yet to institute the kind of concerted, broad-based policy response needed to address property sector imbalances and reignite economic growth. Elsewhere in Asia, we have continued to find opportunities in Taiwan and South Korea, especially with technology companies we see as potential beneficiaries of technology innovation, especially around AI. As we look for opportunities to capitalize on these broad-based opportunities, we continue to adhere to our three-lens approach that looks for high-quality companies, with strong governance structures, in favorable countries.

For equity portfolios, relative contribution compares the performance of a security in the portfolio to the benchmark’s total return, factoring in the difference in weight of that security in the benchmark. Returns are calculated using daily returns and previous day ending weights rolled up by ticker, gross of advisory fees, may exclude certain derivatives and does not represent actual performance.  **There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.**  **Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.**  **Foreign securities are subject** to additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  **Derivatives** can be more volatile and sensitive to economic or market changes than other investments, which could result in losses exceeding the original investment and magnified by leverage.  **Concentrated investments** in a single sector, industry or region will be more susceptible to factors affecting that group and may be more volatile than less concentrated investments or the market as a whole.  **Environmental, Social, and** **Governance (“ESG”)** factors are integrated into the investment process by focusing on those ESG factors considered most likely to have a material impact on the financial performance of the issuers. ESG factors are one of many considerations in the investment decision-making process and may not be determinative in deciding to include or exclude an investment.
