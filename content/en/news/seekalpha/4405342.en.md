Gold prices resumed their upward trend Friday, briefly climbing to new intraday highs above $2,900/oz before paring gains, as President Trump unveiled plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week.

"I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," the president said.

Trump kick-started a trade war at the start of the week when he followed through on his threat to impose new duties on China, although he granted Mexico and Canada a one-month reprieve.

Meanwhile, a U.S. jobs report showed the domestic economy added 143K jobs in January, evidence of a moderating but still resilient labor market, which would appear to support the case for the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates for now; such a scenario could be bearish for non-interest bearing gold but the metal remains well supported by safe-haven demand.

Rather than the usual price drivers such as the strength of the U.S. dollar and interest rate expectations, safe-haven demand in politically turbulent times is driving gold's rally, particularly reflects uncertainties surrounding Trump's policies, Commerzbank analysts [said](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-edges-higher-on-tariff-fears-13e2e3c8).

Inflation will be a critical driver for gold prices, and market attention will be focused on the U.S. consumer price index report set for February 12, according to StoneX analyst Fawad Razaqzada, as a strong inflation print could affect the size and scope of potential Fed rate cuts, lifting the dollar and bond yields.

Front-month Comex gold ([XAUUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR "Gold Spot Price")) for February delivery finished +1.9% for the week to $2,867.30/oz, the metal's sixth consecutive weekly gain and second-highest ever close, and front-month February silver ([XAGUSD:CUR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR "Silver Spot Price")) ended +0.6% to $32.335/oz this week; on Friday, gold gained 0.4% while silver slipped 0.5%.

Analysts are calling for gold to continue its rise to $3,000, including Citigroup, which sees the price barrier breached within three months, as geopolitical tensions and trade wars stoked by President Trump boost demand for safe-haven assets.

“The gold bull market looks set to continue under Trump 2.0 with trade wars and geopolitical tensions reinforcing the reserve diversification/de-dollarization trend,” Citi [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-prices-remain-up-reaching-3000oz-near-term-says-citi-2025-02-06/).

The bank also said an appreciating U.S. dollar will increase the incentive for central banks from emerging economies to boost gold holdings in order to support their own currencies, while investors will turn both to physical gold and ETFs.

But a "Russia-Ukraine peace deal, and confirmation of whether gold would be exempt from broad tariffs (or not), could provide a buying opportunity over the next 2-3 months," Citi also said.
