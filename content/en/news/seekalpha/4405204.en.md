Major indices on the Wall Street were little changed on Friday as investors tried to make sense of the latest job figures and their implications for interest rates.

Although [January’s jobs report](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405109-nonfarm-payrolls-climbs-less-than-expected-in-january-unemployment-unexpectedly-dips) showed a modest 143,000 jobs added for the month, a dip in the unemployment rate is what caught investors’ attention. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.0% from 4.1% in December. 

Wages also showed surprising strength in January, with average hourly earnings rising 0.5% M/M, hotter than the +0.3% consensus. The jump in pay raised inflation fears among investors, nixing chances that the Federal Reserve will resume rate cuts soon.

The Wall Street managed to rebound from the sell-off earlier in the week after Trump announced 10% tariffs on China, along with 25% levies on Canada and Mexico, which he later paused.

The recovery in the stock market over the week was majorly led by strong earnings. Out of the 128 S&P 500 companies that reported earnings this week, 97 of them beat EPS estimates, while 75 of them topped revenue estimates.

Some of the strong EPS wins were by companies such as Uber Technologies ([UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")) which beat EPS estimates by a staggering $2.73, followed by Essex Property Trust ([ESS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ESS "Essex Property Trust, Inc.")), and Gartner ([IT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IT "Gartner, Inc.")). While Everest Group ([EG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EG "Everest Group, Ltd.")) reported the largest miss in EPS, missing estimates by $0.97.

 

288 companies have reported so far this quarter, out of which 222 companies have reported earnings above consensus, 12 companies matched estimates, while 54 companies missed estimates.

On the revenue side, out of 288 companies, 172 companies have exceeded consensus, 1 is in-line with estimates, while 115 companies trailed estimates.

Eight sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in revenue for Q4, led by the Information Technology sector. On the other hand, three sectors are reporting a year-over-year decline in revenue for Q4, led by the Industrials and Materials sectors.

Looking ahead, FactSet analysts expect (year-over-year) earnings growth rates of 8.7% and 10.2% for Q1 2025 and Q2 2025, respectively. For CY 2025, analysts are predicting earnings growth of 13.0%.

Looking at sector-wise performance, the Communication Services sector had names such as The Walt Disney Company ([DIS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS "The Walt Disney Company")) which [beat on top and bottom-line numbers](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403436-disney-beats-on-core-metrics-and-guides-an-upbeat-profit-growth-for-2025) for the first quarter, helped by "Moana 2" outperformance. It also provided an upbeat forecast for the full year.

Google-owner Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")), another prominent name in the sector, could not impress investors as it [narrowly topped profit expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403045-key-takeaways-from-alphabet-earnings-after-in-line-revenues). Revenues were in line with expectations, with a few lackluster unit performances outside core beats in search and YouTube sales.

Among Consumer stocks, e-commerce giant Amazon.com ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) [beat on most metrics](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404698-amazon-solid-q4-results-upstaged-by-soft-guidance-fx-risks), including a 61% surge in operating income, underscoring the company’s successful attempt to rein in costs.

However, an underwhelming outlook weighed on shares as the company projected net sales for Q1 to be between $151B and $155.5B, coming up short of $158B estimates.

In the Financials sector, PayPal ([PYPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL "PayPal Holdings, Inc.")) posted [stronger-than-expected earnings](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402575-paypal-q4-earnings-top-consensus-but-expenses-also-climb) and revenue and issued strong guidance, but its expenses exceeded the consensus estimate.

KKR ([KKR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KKR "KKR & Co. Inc.")) also had a [mixed performance,](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402637-kkr-q4-earnings-top-consensus-assets-under-management-disappoint) as its earnings topped consensus, but assets under management fell short of Wall Street expectations, with its traditional private equity portfolio exhibiting no growth in Q4.

Pharma companies had a good week with beats from prominent names in the sector. Eli Lilly ([LLY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY "Eli Lilly and Company"))’s Q4 results [exceeded](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404294-eli-lilly-stock-rises-q4-2024-beat) Wall Street forecasts and indicated a more than twofold rise in revenue from its weight loss and obesity [drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404290-eli-lilly-non-gaap-eps-of-5_51-beats-by-0_43-revenue-of-13_53b-beats-by-100m)

Pfizer ([PFE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE "Pfizer Inc.")) [beat](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402570-pfizer-non-gaap-eps-of-0_63-beats-by-0_17-revenue-of-17_8b-beats-by-540m) on both the top and bottom lines, but its 2025 financial guidance fell short of expectations. The pharmaceutical giant is projecting revenue of $61B-$64Bthis year. Consensus is $63B. EPS is estimated at $2.80-$3.00. Consensus is $2.93.

The Information Technology sector had successful innings with wins from Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")), Skyworks Solutions ([SWKS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWKS "Skyworks Solutions, Inc.")), Palantir Technologies ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")), and Advanced Micro Devices ([AMD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.")).

Qualcomm's ([QCOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM "QUALCOMM Incorporated")) Q1 fiscal 2025 financial results and its second quarter outlook surpassed consensus estimates across the board as the semiconductor firm expects high smartphone demand.

Palantir Technologies ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")) shares skyrocketed after its [fourth quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402240-palantir-technologies-non-gaap-eps-of-0_14-beats-by-0_03-revenue-of-827_52m-beats-by-46_28m) 2024 results and outlook blasted past expectations, and segment revenue surged across the board.

Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 surpassed the consensus estimate of $0.11. Revenue for the quarter ended December 31 totaled $827.52M, an increase of 36% year over year.

For the upcoming week, more than 70 companies are scheduled to report earnings, with McDonald's ([MCD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD "McDonald's Corporation")), On Semiconductor ([ON](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON "ON Semiconductor Corporation")), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals ([VRTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated")) reporting on Monday. Tuesday will include names such as Coca-Cola ([KO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO "The Coca-Cola Company")) and S&P Global ([SPGI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPGI "S&P Global Inc.")), while Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO "Cisco Systems, Inc.")), CVS Health ([CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")), and Kraft Heinz ([KHC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KHC "The Kraft Heinz Company")) will report on Wednesday.

Airbnb ([ABNB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB "Airbnb, Inc.")), Motorola Solutions ([MSI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSI "Motorola Solutions, Inc.")), and Palo Alto ([PANW](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PANW "Palo Alto Networks, Inc.")) are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, while Friday will include results from Moderna ([MRNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRNA "Moderna, Inc.")).
