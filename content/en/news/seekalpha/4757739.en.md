DNY59





Over the past several years, the dominant story in the stock market has been the AI boom, with leading mega-caps like Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) and Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT "Microsoft Corporation")) soaring to new heights as AI euphoria took hold. At the same time, dividend stocks have been lagging behind the broader market in recent years despite posting very strong fundamentals. A classic example of this is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ([SCHD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD "Schwab Strategic Trust - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF")), which has a 12.23% trailing-month dividend growth rate and a 9.87% dividend CAGR over the past three years. However, its total return performance has lagged meaningfully behind the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ([SPY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY "SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust")) over the past several years.

While I personally believe that AI will be a transformational technology and that much of the appreciation assigned to these stocks is warranted, there is no doubt that valuations in the sector are quite rich. One need look no further than Palantir Technologies ([PLTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR "Palantir Technologies Inc.")), which is trading at an incredibly high valuation that seems unjustified by the good but not incredible growth rates it is generating. For example, it currently trades at about 204 times forward earnings, despite being expected to grow its earnings at a good but not great 36% CAGR through 2029.

Meanwhile, it seems like the market has not noticed that many of the blue-chip dividend-paying companies in SCHD's portfolio will also benefit immensely from AI applications, as AI will lead to significant reductions in labor and material costs as well as enhanced decision-making surrounding capital allocation, supply chain management, and marketing decisions.

On top of that, REITs ([VNQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ "Vanguard Real Estate ETF")) have been particularly hammered in recent years as elevated interest rates have weighed on the sector.

However, the underlying fundamentals of these companies remain very strong, with solid occupancies in the vast majority of cases, well-covered dividends that continue to grow, and strong investment-grade balance sheets. As a result, many of these now trade at steep discounts to the private market value of their real estate.

Even in the energy sector ([XLE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLE "Energy Select Sector SPDR® Fund ETF")), despite the euphoria surrounding AI, there are numerous opportunities trading at steep discounts. It seems like Mr. Market has been applying uneven levels of optimism about the AI boom when it comes to individual energy production and energy infrastructure companies. Overall, however, the energy sector has slumped significantly and has lagged behind the AI boom by a large margin. In our view, this creates a rare buying opportunity for dividend investors to load up before a major market reversal takes place.

This article details some of the most promising opportunities to do so.

Opportunity #1
--------------

In our view, SCHD is one such opportunity, as already pointed out in this article and in a [recent analysis](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4748446-schd-top-holdings-show-way-too-cheap) I wrote on the ETF, since many of its top holdings are quite undervalued at the moment. Until the recent AI boom, SCHD had performed very competitively with SPY, and in fact, it outperformed SPY over several periods of time.

Therefore, we believe that as market optimism over AI cools down and the benefits of AI applications begin to impact the bottom lines of many of the dividend payers in SCHD’s portfolio, performance will likely even out.

Opportunity #2
--------------

As pointed out earlier in this article, we also really like the REIT sector right now. In particular, we believe blue chips like Realty Income ([O](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O "Realty Income Corporation")), Alexandria Real Estate Equities ([ARE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARE "Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.")), Gladstone Land Corporation ([LAND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAND "Gladstone Land Corporation")), and W. P. Carey ([WPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC "W. P. Carey Inc.")) all offer compelling value at the moment. These companies feature high dividend yields that are well covered by cash flows, strong balance sheets that are investment-grade in many cases, and discounts to the private market value of their real estate, along with even steeper discounts to their historical valuation multiples. While the REIT sector may be less likely to benefit immediately from AI applications—although there still could be some positive impact—the biggest way they will likely benefit is through AI’s deflationary effect, which should cause long-term interest rates to decline meaningfully, in turn pushing REIT valuations materially higher.

As a result, now is the time to load up on these REITs while they trade at steep discounts in order to capitalize on the upswing when they come back into favor. In fact, we view the current opportunity as similar to where MLPs ([AMLP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP "ALPS Alerian MLP ETF")) were coming out of the COVID-19 lockdowns when the energy industry had fallen far out of favor and the ESG movement was booming. Since then, midstream has been one of the strongest performers, not only in the dividend space but in the broader market as well.

Opportunity #3
--------------

That said, we also believe there are still compelling opportunities in energy infrastructure ([MLPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLPX "Global X MLP & Energy Infrastructure ETF")) as well as energy production. While some companies like Vistra Corporation ([VST](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VST "Vistra Corp.")) and Constellation Energy ([CEG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CEG "Constellation Energy Corporation")) have benefited immensely from the AI boom—and even some midstream companies such as The Williams Companies ([WMB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMB "The Williams Companies, Inc.")), Kinder Morgan ([KMI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI "Kinder Morgan, Inc.")), Energy Transfer ([ET](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET "Energy Transfer LP Common Units")), and ONEOK ([OKE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE "ONEOK, Inc.")) have soared—there are still some underappreciated value plays.

For example, we think Brookfield Renewable Partners ([BEP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BEP "Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. Limited Partnership Units"))([BEPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BEPC "Brookfield Renewable Corporation")) and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners ([BIP](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIP "Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. Limited Partnership Units"))([BIPC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIPC "Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation")) are both very well-positioned to benefit. BEP has a thriving nuclear business that should benefit immensely from the AI boom, and it also has a large and lengthy power purchase agreement with MSFT to provide a significant amount of power for AI expansion. BEP has also signaled confidence that it will be able to expand that agreement, as well as potentially sign new ones with other hyperscalers. Meanwhile, BIP owns infrastructure and utility assets that should benefit from increasing electricity demand and is investing heavily to scale its data center business, which is expected to generate strong returns as AI-driven industrial demand continues to surge.

There are also several energy production companies that are attractively valued right now, including large players like Chevron ([CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) and Canadian Natural Resources ([CNQ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ "Canadian Natural Resources Limited")). These companies have exposure to both natural gas and oil and should therefore benefit from the AI-related surge in energy demand. Moreover, they are currently trading at attractive valuations, offering dividend yields of around 5%, and have a strong track record of consistently growing their dividends over time.

Finally, within the energy infrastructure space, there are several attractive plays, but Enterprise Products Partners ([EPD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD "Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units")) remains one of the most reasonably valued midstream companies with well-located assets. Many of these assets should benefit from rising data center demand, further supporting long-term growth.

Investor Takeaway
-----------------

As this article points out, the AI boom has lifted markets to new highs and enriched many investors who loaded up on tech stocks during the dip in 2022 before it took off in earnest. However, there are still numerous opportunities to profit from the AI boom, and we believe now is the time to load up on dividend-paying stocks—whether through a diversified ETF like SCHD or by buying deeply discounted, high-quality REITs and energy infrastructure companies—ahead of what we expect to be a major market reversal. This is the approach we are taking at [High Yield Investor](https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor).
