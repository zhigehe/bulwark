Phillips 66 (NYSE:[PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX)) activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management has built a more than $2.5B stake in the oil refiner and plans to push for operational changes to boost the company's stagnant stock price, *The Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.

Elliott plans to seek a number of changes to simplify Phillips 66 (NYSE:[PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")), most notably pushing for a sale or spinoff of the company's midstream business, according to the [report](https://www.wsj.com/finance/activist-elliott-ratchets-up-pressure-on-phillips-66-with-over-2-5-billion-stake-af2fc33c).

Elliott also believes Phillips 66 ([PSX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSX "Phillips 66")) has not fulfilled a previous commitment to make board changes, after the two sides reached an agreement a year ago on a new board member after the investment firm had first pushed the company for strategic improvements; the director with Elliottâ€™s blessing still has not been named.

Elliott has a record of successful investments across the energy sector, including at Marathon Oil, NRG Energy, Suncor Energy and Hess, and it [recently built a stake in BP](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405379-elliott-has-built-stake-in-bp-report).
