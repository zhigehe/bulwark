European natural gas prices jumped to two-year highs Monday, as higher fuel demand due to colder temperatures risks draining already low inventories.

The benchmark front-month gas contract at the Dutch TTF hub rose as much as 5.4% to €58.75/MWh, the highest level since February 2023, after contracts already posted four consecutive weeks of gains.

"Temperatures are expected to fall sharply in coming days, particularly in the U.K., Germany and France. This will likely lead to an acceleration of withdrawals from stockpiles, which are already at their lowest level for this time of year since the energy crisis in 2022," ANZ Research analysts [wrote](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/european-gas-price-hits-two-year-high-amid-fast-depleting-inventories-e9e451de).

Losing most of Russian supply during the past three years "has turned European gas markets more susceptible to price shocks in response to short-term outages, LNG demand in Asia and changes in weather," Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Patricio Alvarez [said](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/10/europe-teeters-toward-energy-crisis-as-gas-reaches-two-year-high/).

Gas storage in the European Union was 49% full as of Saturday, compared to 67% full at the same time last year, with particularly high daily net withdrawals in Germany due to low wind-power generation, according to data from industry group Gas Infrastructure Europe.

EU members are required to have storage facilities filled to at least 90% of their capacity by November 1, but current inventory levels are expected to make restocking efforts difficult over the summer.
