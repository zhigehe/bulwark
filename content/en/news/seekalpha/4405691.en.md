### Management View

* CEO Blake Moret highlighted operational efficiency and cost control initiatives, projecting $250 million in productivity benefits for fiscal 2025. He confirmed mitigation plans for newly announced tariffs, emphasizing the company's strong U.S. manufacturing footprint.
* Orders grew 10% year-over-year, with mid-single-digit sequential growth across all regions and segments. Backlogs increased, supported by large multi-year project wins in industries like automotive, logistics, and life sciences.
* CFO Christian Rothe reported adjusted EPS of $1.83 for Q1 2025, attributing the performance to cost reductions and favorable price-cost dynamics. Free cash flow conversion reached 140%, reflecting strong working capital management.

### Outlook

* Management reaffirmed fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS guidance with a midpoint of $9.20 and expects free cash flow conversion of 100% for the year. Organic sales are projected to range between negative 4% and positive 2%, reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties.
* Annual recurring revenue is targeted to grow 10%. Segment margins are forecasted at 19% for the fiscal year, supported by ongoing cost productivity measures.
* Sequential sales growth is anticipated throughout fiscal 2025, with Q2 sales expected to rise low-to-mid single digits from Q1.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EPS for Q1 2025 was $1.83 compared to analysts' estimate of $1.58. Revenues for the quarter reached approximately $1.88 billion vs. analysts' estimate of $1.88 billion.
* Segment operating margins were 17.1%, slightly down from 17.3% in the previous year, impacted by lower sales volumes offset by cost reductions.
* Total ARR increased 11%, driven by strong software offerings. Free cash flow of $293 million was $328 million higher than the prior year due to improved working capital management and zero incentive payouts.

### Q&A

* Scott Davis, Melius Research, asked about SKU rationalization impacts. CFO Rothe clarified that the 21,000 SKUs eliminated were low-sales or no-sales items and should not materially affect 2025.
* Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup, queried the drivers of improved orders in Q1. CEO Moret attributed this to reduced channel destocking, growth in hybrid markets, and new product introductions like the OTTO mobile robots and FactoryTalk Optix.
* Chris Snyder, Morgan Stanley, questioned whether post-election optimism influenced orders. CEO Moret noted broader optimism and an uptick in customer project activity, with PMI in the U.S. crossing 50.

* Analysts shifted focus from channel destocking in Q4 2024 to improved order visibility in Q1 2025.
