Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded CVS Health (NYSE:[CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")) to Overweight from Neutral and increased its 12-month per-share target to $71 from $62 on Wednesday after the managed care giant delivered better-than-expected [financials for Q4 2024.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4406692-cvs-health-stock-jumps-q4-beat)

With CVS (NYSE:[CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")) reporting its first full quarter of results under its new CEO, David Joyner, Cantor argued that the company “has the right team in place” to resurrect its insurance business, Aetna, and withstand a challenging regulatory and retail backdrop.

Additionally, the analysts are more confident in CVS’ (NYSE:[CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")) ability to return to normal Medicare Advantage margins in 2027.

Noting that the current implied multiple on Aetna undervalues the overall business, the analysts said that the business doesn’t deserve to trade around historical multiples with a discount, given that it has already shown initial signs of margin turnaround.

Earlier in the day, CVS ([CVS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVS "CVS Health Corporation")) reported better than expected financials for Q4, thanks mainly to growth in its Health Care Benefits segment, which houses Aetna and its Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.
