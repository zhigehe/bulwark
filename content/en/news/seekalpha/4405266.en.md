A growing number of companies across different sectors are following Strategy's ([MSTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR "Strategy")) lead in incorporating bitcoin into their treasuries, underscoring a broader acceptance of the cryptocurrency within corporate finance.

Since 2020, Strategy ([MSTR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR "Strategy")) has been raising capital via debt and equity offerings to finance bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) purchases and accumulate the tokens on its balance sheet. All told, the carrying value of the company's bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) holdings stood at a whopping $23.9B as of Dec. 31, 2024, easily making it the largest corporate holder of BTC.

And its bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) purchases have become bigger and more consistent over time, although it [didn't buy](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401880-microstrategy-didnt-buy-any-bitcoin-last-week "didn't buy") any coins during the week ended Feb. 2.

Other companies have been taking notice of MSTR's buying spree, as the price of bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) has [surged nearly 900%](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD/charting "surged nearly 900%") over the last five years, with recent gains buoyed by prospects of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration .

KULR Technology Group ([KULR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KULR "KULR Technology Group, Inc.")) is one of the latest companies to adopt bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) as a treasury reserve. In December, the thermal management tech provider said it [will allocate](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4390961-kulr-purchases-21718-bitcoin-for-21-million "will allocate") up to 90% of its surplus cash to bitcoin.

Video-sharing platform Rumble ([RUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RUM "Rumble Inc.")) announced in November plans to adopt a bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) treasury strategy.

“We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly U.S. presidential administration and increased institutional adoption," Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski had [said](https://corp.rumble.com/blog/rumble-announces-bitcoin-treasury-strategy/ "said") in a statement.

"Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury,” he added.

Social media platform Reddit ([RDDT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT "Reddit, Inc.")) had [disclosed](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4071141-reddit-holds-bitcoin-ether-for-treasury-purposes-ipo-filing-says "disclosed") in its initial public offering filing that it invested some of its excess cash in bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD "Bitcoin USD")) and ether ([ETH-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETH-USD "Ethereum USD")).

Other bitcoin-holding public firms include Elon Musk's Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")), crypto exchange Coinbase Global ([COIN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN "Coinbase Global, Inc.")), payments giant Block ([XYZ](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ "Block, Inc.")), crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital ([OTCPK:BRPHF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRPHF "Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.")), Hut 8 Mining ([HUT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT "Hut 8 Corp.")), Cleanspark ([CLSK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLSK "CleanSpark, Inc.")), Mara Holdings ([MARA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA "MARA Holdings, Inc.")), Riot Platforms ([RIOT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT "Riot Platforms, Inc.")), Cathedra Bitcoin ([CBIT:CA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBIT:CA "Cathedra Bitcoin Inc.")), DeFi Technologies ([DEFI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEFI "Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF")), HIVE Blockchain Technologies ([HIVE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIVE "HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.")) and Japan-based Metaplanet ([OTC:MTPLF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTPLF "Metaplanet Inc.")).
