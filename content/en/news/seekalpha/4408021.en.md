Earnings Call Insights: Calian Group Ltd. ([OTCPK:CLNFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLNFF "Calian Group Ltd.")) Q1 2025

### Management View

* CEO Kevin Ford highlighted Q1 revenues of $185M, representing a 3% increase and the highest first-quarter revenue in company history. The company secured new contracts worth $154M, ending the quarter with a $1.1B backlog. Defense remains a key focus, accounting for 44% of fiscal 2024 consolidated revenues.
* The defense market presents significant growth opportunities, driven by global demand and macro tailwinds such as NATO capacity-building and Canada's increased border security spending. The company is doubling down on its operational readiness portfolio, which includes solutions in cybersecurity, healthcare, and training.
* Recent strategic hires include Major-General Roch Pelletier as Regional VP of Global Defence and Security and a Managing Director for the UK defense business. These appointments aim to strengthen growth in Canada, Europe, and the U.S.
* CFO Patrick Houston reported adjusted EBITDA of $18M for Q1, down from $21M in the prior year, impacted by revenue mix and investments in sales capacity. Adjusted net profit stood at $10.5M or $0.88 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $4M, influenced by $8M in working capital investments.

### Outlook

* FY2025 revenue guidance remains at $800M to $880M, with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $96M to $106M. This reflects anticipated double-digit growth for the eighth consecutive year.
* Management noted 73% of FY2025 revenue is already covered through backlog and recurring revenue streams. Seasonal fluctuations are expected, with Q2 and Q4 being the busiest quarters due to evolving customer behavior.
* The guidance assumes no major changes in economic conditions, defense spending, or supply chains. Contributions from new M&A activities are not included but would be incremental.

### Financial Results

* Q1 revenues of $185M compared to analysts' estimate of $181.72M.
* Adjusted EPS of $0.88 vs. analysts’ estimate of $0.80.
* Gross margin was 32%, slightly below the prior year due to revenue mix changes. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 9.6% from 11.9% in the prior year.
* Trailing 12-month revenues reached $752M, up 9%, while adjusted EBITDA stood at $89M, reflecting an 11.8% margin.

### Q&A

* Doug Taylor, Canaccord Genuity: Questioned the stabilization of Canadian defense budgets and capacity-building initiatives. CEO Kevin Ford stated training businesses have stabilized, with no further cuts anticipated, and discussions are now focused on capacity building.
* Scott Fletcher, CIBC: Inquired about the integration of Mabway into sales efforts. CEO Ford emphasized strong performance, highlighting opportunities in NATO and UK defense markets.
* Paul Treiber, RBC Capital Markets: Asked about revenue exposure to potential tariffs. CFO Houston explained that only 5% of U.S. revenues involve exports from Canada, with mitigation plans including U.S.-based sourcing.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, pressing on defense spending, guidance visibility, and integration of acquisitions.
* Management displayed confidence in defense market tailwinds, the U.S. subsidiary launch, and broader growth initiatives. CEO Kevin Ford stated, "We are confident in delivering exceptional results despite significant uncertainty."
* Compared to Q4 2024, the tone was slightly more upbeat, focusing on stabilization and growth opportunities.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* FY2025 Q1 revenue growth of 3% contrasts with Q4 2024’s 13% annual growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA margins declined in Q1 due to revenue mix and increased investments.
* Management tone shifted from addressing Canadian Armed Forces budget pressures in Q4 2024 to emphasizing stabilization and growth in Q1 2025.
* Analysts' focus on organic growth and defense spending remained consistent, but questions on tariff impacts and U.S. defense expansion were more prominent this quarter.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted potential challenges from U.S. tariff discussions and their impact on competitiveness. Mitigation strategies include leveraging U.S. operations and exploring alternative sourcing.
* Delays in large space and IT infrastructure projects were noted, with management expecting recovery in the latter half of FY2025.
* Analysts raised concerns about the Canadian federal election and its impact on procurement timelines. Management emphasized proactive government relations efforts.

### Final Takeaway

Calian Group's Q1 2025 results align with its FY2025 revenue target of $800M-$880M, supported by a strong defense focus and robust backlog. While adjusted EBITDA margins faced pressure from investments, management remains optimistic about stabilization in Canadian defense spending and opportunities in global markets. Strategic hires, a U.S. subsidiary launch, and a growing NATO presence position the company for sustained growth amid market uncertainties.
