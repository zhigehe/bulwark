Raymond James reiterated a Strong Buy rating on Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) in a note Monday, highlighting its attractive valuation and potential benefits from U.S. tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Despite cutting estimates for 2025 due to margin pressures and foreign exchange headwinds, analysts emphasized that Mohawk remains free cash flow positive with a strong balance sheet.According to Raymond James, Mohawk’s stock is currently trading at replacement value, which has historically marked support levels. Analysts stated, "Along with repo, we expect these items will limit downside, while significant upside is possible in the event of a positive turn in industry demand or the imposition of U.S. tariffs."For Q4 2024, adjusted EPS came in at $1.95, beating both Raymond James' estimate of $1.87 and Wall Street’s forecast of $1.85.The earnings beat was attributed to better-than-expected sales, as margins remained in line with expectations. However, analysts lowered their Q1 2025 EPS estimate to $1.42 from $1.78 due to one-time ERP (enterprise resource planning) issues.Looking ahead, Mohawk expects a sequential sales increase of 6-7% in Q2, alongside EBIT margin expansion of 200-300 basis points. However, industry demand remains under pressure due to high interest rates and slow housing turnover.Raymond James continues to view Mohawk as a tariff beneficiary, given its strong U.S. ceramic and luxury vinyl tile (LVT) businesses, which compete against imports. The company also resumed $74 million in share repurchases in Q4 at $130 per share, reinforcing valuation support.Raymond James lowered its price target to $165 from $185 but maintained a bullish outlook, stating that Mohawk’s "appraised asset value" stands at $120, providing a floor for the stock.
