Analysts at Stifel are urging investors to take advantage of what they see as an overreaction in Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC) shares following the company's latest revenue update. Despite a sharp decline in the stock price, Stifel maintains its "buy" rating, citing long-term potential and flexibility.Semtech's stock took a major hit after the company disclosed in an 8-K filing that revenue expectations for its CopperEdge product line in fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026) will fall below prior estimates. The shortfall is attributed to shifts in server rack architecture, specifically a decision by a key customer—believed to be Nvidia—to move away from certain configurations where Semtech had greater product exposure. The result is a lower-than-expected ramp-up for CopperEdge products over the next 12 months.Shares of Semtech dropped 18.5% on February 7, closing at $54.51, before tumbling another 27% in after-hours trading to below $40. This steep decline came despite the fact that CopperEdge revenue was projected to account for just 6%-8% of total revenue. According to analysts at Stifel, this level of reaction is excessive given the relatively limited near-term financial impact.While acknowledging the near-term setback, Stifel maintains that the overall market for active copper cables (ACCs) remains strong. The shift away from NVL36x2 systems may have impacted immediate revenue expectations, but demand for copper-based solutions in AI and data center infrastructure is still growing due to cost and energy efficiency advantages.Despite the CopperEdge setback, Stifel sees several factors supporting Semtech’s long-term investment case. The company has improved its balance sheet, boosted by a $770 million cash position following a secondary offering in December. Additional options, including restructuring and asset sales, could further strengthen its financial standing. Moreover, Semtech continues to generate revenue across multiple segments, with the CopperEdge business accounting for only a small fraction of its total sales. Its broader Signal Integrity segment, along with analog, mixed-signal, and wireless products, remains a diversified revenue driver.As for Semtech's turnaround, Stifel believes the company's new leadership will continue to build upon recent progress. The brokerage notes that sequential revenue growth has returned, and restructuring efforts have provided sufficient financial flexibility to steer the company through the current market conditions. Moreover, there are long-term catalysts in the IoT business, particularly through the acquisition of LoRa and SWIR, which could drive growth.Stifel has slightly adjusted its 12-month price target to $70 from $75, reflecting the near-term revenue hit but maintaining confidence in the company’s broader trajectory. The valuation is based on a 6.1x enterprise value-to-sales multiple for calendar year 2025. Risks to this target include the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, potential IP litigation, and market adoption of new technologies.
