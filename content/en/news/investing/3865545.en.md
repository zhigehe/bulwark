Investing.com - Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is due to report its fiscal second-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday, with analysts on the lookout for developments around artificial intelligence-powered demand for the group's networking gear.In a note to clients last month, analysts at Citi said demand for so-called campus switches, which account for about a fifth of Cisco's sales, is expected to have returned to growth in the calendar fourth quarter of 2024 thanks to normalizing inventory levels.Cisco, which is expected to report earnings for the quarter ended in January, has been grappling with headwinds like supply chain snags and a post-pandemic sluggishness at its crucial networking gear business.Analysts argued that the anticipated improvement in campus switching, along with an "undemanding" comparative figure in the calendar fourth quarter of 2023 and two three-month periods of sequential growth, set Cisco up "to achieve its January quarter guidance" and potentially raise its full-year 2025 outlook versus the prior guide for a 3%-5% top-line uptick.The comments come after Cisco forecast quarterly revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates in November.The firm sees its second-quarter revenue at between $13.75 billion to $13.95 billion, higher than analysts' average projections of $13.73 billion, Reuters reported, citing LSEG data. Adjusted quarterly profit, meanwhile, is tipped to be in a range of $0.89 to $0.91, versus estimates of $0.87.Cisco's sales dropped by 6% to $13.84 billion in the first quarter ended on October 26, although the return was still above expectations of $13.77 billion. Adjusted income per share came in at $0.91.For its current fiscal year, Cisco estimates adjusted profit of $3.60 to $3.66 on revenue of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion."We expect an in-line January quarter following last quarter's results, which showed overall business stabilization and early enterprise refresh activity," analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC) said in a note to clients."The improved spending environment is driving recovery across the networking space."
