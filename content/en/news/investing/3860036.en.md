By Lisa Baertlein (Reuters) - U.S. container imports hit a record high in January, with goods from China notching a year-over-year gain of 10.2%, supply chain technology provider Descartes (NASDAQ:DSGX) said on Monday. U.S. seaports handled 2.49 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in January, topping the previous January import record set in 2022. Goods from China accounted for 997,909 TEUs of last month's total. Some U.S. importers have been rushing in some goods ahead of expected new tariffs and other potential supply-chain disruptions. Goods ranging from plastic toys to parts from machinery have ticked higher in recent months, experts said. President Donald Trump imposed a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods as of February 4 but paused until March more aggressive 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada to allow for further negotiations.
