Elon Musk is taking his battle with OpenAI to a new level.... he is trying to buy the entire company.  
According to late-breaking reports from the Wall Street Journal, Elon Musk has assembled a consortium of investors and is offering to acquire the ChatGPT maker for $97.4 billion.  
Marc Toberoff, who is Musk's attorney, said the bid was presented to OpenAI's board on Monday.  
Musk has been a vocal opponent of OpenAI's Sam Altman's plan to turn the company into a for-profit entity.  
"It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in a statement provided by Toberoff. “We will make sure that happens.”  
OpenAI most recently was said to be worth $300 billion, based on new potential funding from SoftBank (TYO:9984).  
OpenAI and SoftBank announced an aggressive $500 billion AI project, Stargate, with President Trump in January.
