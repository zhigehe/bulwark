WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives speaker said on Sunday he would stick with a "one big bill" strategy to pass President Donald Trump's tax-cut agenda and fund border and military priorities despite a limited $340 billion budget plan unveiled on Friday by Senate Republicans. Mike Johnson told Fox News Sunday that it will take some time to secure Republican consensus amid the party's thin House majority, but he said they would find savings to offset the cost of extending 2017 tax cuts that are due to expire at the end of the year and other priorities such as excluding tip income from taxation. "Well, I talk with the president and his team about this almost constantly, reminding them that we will get the job done, but it has to be the one big bill strategy," Johnson said. "And the reason for that is because that gives us the highest probability of success of delivering on all these campaign promises."
