DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings today (Tuesday, February 11), after the market close, with analysts expecting solid results. Both Wolfe Research and Wells Fargo said in notes that they anticipate the company will exceed guidance on Gross Order Value (GOV) and EBITDA, continuing its trend of outperformance.Wolfe Research forecasts a GOV growth rate of 19% and an EBITDA margin of 2.7%, in line with consensus estimates. "DoorDash has come in above the high-end of the company’s GOV guide each of the past 13 quarters and above the mid-point of its EBITDA guide 12 of the last 13 quarters," the firm noted, highlighting the company’s consistent execution.Wells Fargo also expects a beat, raising its GOV estimate to $21.1 billion, slightly above the high-end of DoorDash’s guidance and 0.7% higher than consensus. The bank projects EBITDA of $579 million, 3% above Street expectations, citing "healthy traffic trends offsetting Wolt FX headwinds."Looking ahead to the first quarter, analysts expect strong guidance. Analysts anticipate the high-end of management’s GOV outlook will be 1% above consensus, with the mid-point of EBITDA guidance exceeding the Street by 2%. Wells Fargo predicts a GOV range of $22.1 billion to $22.5 billion and EBITDA between $550 million and $600 million, aligning with expectations.Key investor topics include DoorDash’s strength in its core U.S. restaurant segment, international expansion, advertising revenue growth, and margin trajectory. Analysts highlighted that "consumer spend data suggests sustained order preference and frequency," while Wells Fargo expects DoorDash to continue gaining market share in grocery and scale DashPass membership to 22 million by year-end 2025.Overall, analysts expect a beat on both GOV and EBITDA, while Wells Fargo expects another solid print and guide.
