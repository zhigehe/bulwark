(Reuters) - Russell Vought, who was confirmed by the Senate as the head of the Office of Management and Budget on Thursday, took over control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday night, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Vought is now the acting director of the CFPB, according to WSJ, after Rohit Chopra announced early Saturday he was stepping down as head of the top U.S. watchdog agency for consumer finance after President Donald Trump fired him overnight.
