Morgan Stanley sees the expanding generative AI (GenAI) monetization as a key catalyst for one company’s stock. The bank maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) in a note Thursday, highlighting the introduction of Firefly Video’s tiered pricing model as a significant move toward stronger user adoption and targeted monetization.“With the launch of the Firefly Video model, Adobe rolls out a tiered pricing model aimed at enabling both strong user adoption and a more targeted monetization capability,” analysts noted. The new pricing structure includes a Standard plan at $9.99 per month and a Pro plan at $29.99 per month, replacing the previous Credit Pack system. A Premium tier is expected to follow, providing an upgrade path for users.Adobe’s competitive edge in GenAI remains copyright safety, vector-based images, and workflow integration with Creative Cloud, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank noted that Firefly usage has ramped significantly, with Adobe reporting 18 billion cumulative generations, up from 16 billion at the end of Q4.The Firefly Video Model, now in public beta, introduces features such as Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video Transformation, Advanced Camera Control, and Atmospheric Element Integration. Morgan Stanley said Adobe aims to integrate these features seamlessly with Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator.The bank also points to Adobe’s upcoming Summit User Conference (March 18-20) in Las Vegas as a near-term catalyst. The event will include an Analyst Day, where management is expected to share more details on GenAI monetization strategies and potentially introduce new SKUs or solution tiers.With Adobe shares trading at 1.8x PEG (historical 2.2x) and a return to mid-teens EPS growth, analysts see a favorable risk/reward opportunity as Firefly’s monetization scales.
