PARIS (Reuters) - Global investment firm Brookfield will invest 20 billion euros ($20.65 billion) to develop artificial intelligence related projects in France, French newspaper Tribune reported on Sunday. It added Brookfield will earmark 15 billion euros for data centres to be built across France and dedicate another 5 billion to infrastructure for data transfer, storage chips and renewable energy production. These projects are scheduled to run until 2030, the Tribune also reported. On Monday, France hosts the Artificial Intelligence Action (WA:ACT) Summit, gathering in Paris heads of state and government, leaders of international organisations, CEOs of small and large companies, representatives of academia, non-governmental organisations, artists and members of civil society.
