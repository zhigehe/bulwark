Investing.com - On Wednesday, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared the updated roadmap for the next iterations of its Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, GPT-4.5 and GPT-5. The lab aims to simplify its product offerings and enhance the user experience with its AI models.OpenAI is working towards creating a unified intelligence system that would eliminate the need for a model picker, a feature that has been a source of complexity for users. The upcoming GPT-4.5, internally referred to as Orion, will be the last model in the series that does not incorporate a chain-of-thought feature.The lab's primary goal following the release of GPT-4.5 is to integrate the o-series models and GPT-series models. This unified system will be capable of utilizing all available tools, determining when extensive thinking is required, and will be adaptable to a broad spectrum of tasks.GPT-5, the subsequent release, will be a comprehensive system that merges a significant portion of OpenAI's technologies, including the o3 model. The standalone version of the o3 model will no longer be available after the introduction of GPT-5.OpenAI is also planning changes for its ChatGPT platform and API. Users of the free tier of ChatGPT will have unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting, although usage will be monitored to prevent abuse.For Plus and Pro subscribers of ChatGPT, there will be options to run GPT-5 at higher intelligence levels. These enhanced models will include features such as voice, canvas, search, and deep research capabilities. The changes aim to provide a more streamlined and efficient AI experience for users across the board.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
