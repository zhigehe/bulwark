Investing.com -Â U.S. consumer prices rose by more than expected in January, pointing to lingering inflationary pressures that could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to carefully approach future potential interest rate reductions.  
Headline consumer prices increased by 3.0% in the twelve months to January, above expectations that the reading would match December's pace of 2.9%. Month-on-month, the gauge unexpectedly accelerated to 0.5%, up from 0.4% in the prior month and faster than economists' expectations of 0.3%.
