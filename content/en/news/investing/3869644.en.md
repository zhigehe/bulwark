As Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, analysts at BofA Securities remain cautious about the company’s financial outlook. The brokerage reiterates its “underperform” rating on the stock, citing ongoing challenges related to the decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenues and uncertainty surrounding its broader pipeline of products.BofA Securities has adjusted its revenue projections for Moderna, lowering its estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 18% and 15%, respectively. Analysts attribute these reductions to declining demand for COVID-19 vaccines, increased competition, and uncertainty around the uptake of new products, such as its RSV and flu vaccines. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect Moderna’s total revenue to decline by 16%, with earnings per share also seeing a similar downward adjustment.Investors will be looking for clarity on several key topics during Moderna’s earnings call. A major point of focus will be the company’s revised 2025 guidance, which was sharply lowered earlier this year. Moderna now expects revenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, down from a previous estimate of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. This revision reflects declining COVID-19 vaccine sales and uncertainties regarding the commercial rollout of new products.Another issue that could weigh on sentiment is the potential impact of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Analysts at BofA Securities view this as a risk factor, given Kennedy’s long-standing skepticism of vaccines. With Moderna’s revenue still heavily reliant on vaccine sales, any policy shifts under a new HHS leadership could introduce further uncertainty.As far as future growth goes, Moderna is betting on several pipeline products in late stages of development. In addition to cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccines (mRNA-1647), norovirus vaccines (mRNA-1403), and COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1283), a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine is also expected to be introduced. Analysts are cautious about the commercial viability of these programs, emphasizing that their success is far from certain.Despite its ambitious pipeline, Moderna continues to face financial headwinds. The company remains unprofitable, and BofA Securities does not expect it to break even until 2030, later than Moderna’s own projections. The brokerage has also cut its price target for Moderna’s stock to $34 from $41, reflecting reduced revenue expectations and higher perceived risks.
