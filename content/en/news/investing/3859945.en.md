Investing.com - Lattice (OTC:LTTC) Semiconductor is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wall Street on Monday, with analysts anticipating that strength in its computing division may be offset by ongoing industry headwinds in its industrial and automotive end markets.Oregon-based Lattice specializes in designing and manufacturing low power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a type of programmable integrated circuit. The products are used in a range of end markets, including data centers, automotive, and consumer electronics.The group is seen delivering quarterly results in line with consensus expectations for revenue of $117 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.19, analysts at Rosenblatt said in a note to clients.Current-quarter revenue guidance is also tipped to be $120 million, with adjusted per-share profit seen at $0.21."We see the embedded market as mixed and Lattice seeing an extended time to recovery, which is consistent with trends from broader-based players in the analog/embedded space," analysts at Rosenblatt said."While management will likely maintain its stance of a more U-shaped cycle recovery, we believe the company's robust design win momentum, a strong backlog, and share gains in the small FPGA market will help Lattice achieve low single-digit growth in 2025."The earnings come as Lattice is eyeing a possible offer for all of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Altera unit, which designs low-power programmable chips, according to Bloomberg News.Lattice and a host of private equity firms have been shortlisted by Intel for the next round of bidding on Altera, the news service reported in December. Buyout firms Francisco Partners and Silver Lake Management are competing alongside Lattice in a second round for Altera, Bloomberg said.Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and Bain Capital were also indentified as suitors for Altera, Bloomberg added. Intel gave the interested groups toward the end of last month to formalize an offer, the report noted.
