Morgan Stanley analysts urged investors to buy a Google-related “blip dip” in this stock, raising their price target.Shares in social media platform Reddit (RDDT) slumped after it reported weaker-than-expected user numbers for the fourth quarter, impacted by a recent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithm change. Reddit’s Q4 results and its outlook for the first quarter exceeded expectations, showcasing the platform's robust momentum and monetization potential. In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted Reddit’s strong advertising and engagement innovation pipelines, with significant year-over-year growth in ad verticals. According to the Wall Street bank, the company's machine learning (ML) models, conversion modeling improvements, and creative optimization are expected to drive further performance enhancements for advertisers.“As it pertains to measurement, we expect RDDT to continue to improve conversion modeling to capture value from the impressions it is delivering for advertisers,” the analysts noted. “On creative optimization, we expect RDDT to extract insight from underlying ad creative decisions to better understand how these factors drive performance,” they added.Morgan Stanley also highlighted Reddit’s segmentation of user cohorts into 'scrollers' and 'seekers,' each receiving tailored platform improvements to enhance user conversion rates. The introduction of a more streamlined login process and targeting improvements on the home feed have been key to retaining 'scrollers.' Meanwhile, 'seekers' benefit from enhanced search capabilities, including the beta launch of Reddit Answers in the US, an AI-powered search tool that provides summaries of community discussions.“Over the course of the year, we expect Reddit to create a more unified Reddit Search experience that expands beyond just Reddit Answers that helps users navigate subreddits and answer subjective questions,” the analysts continued.“This is a key driver of retention for the over half of new users who run a search in their first session and ultimately a potential driver of monetization given the high-intent nature of search.”Despite a temporary setback in user growth due to the Google algorithm change and an internal bug, Morgan Stanley believes that Reddit has adjusted well and is witnessing stronger user growth since January. The firm expects US daily active unique (DAU) visitors to grow by approximately 2 million quarter over quarter in the first quarter.The Q4 miss in DAUs weighed in on the stock, but the analysts see the sell-off as a buying opportunity.“Given the importance of user growth to the long-term multiple and this reminder of RDDT’s sensitivity to GOOGL changes (which happen regularly), this miss may create pressure on the name (until 1Q earnings in an extreme case),” the analysts said. “If this happens, we are buyers of RDDT as we believe this was not a major change and believe that RDDT’s relationship with GOOGL remains strong,” they added.In line with their positive view, the analysts lifted their Reddit estimates and price target to $210 from $200, while maintaining an Overweight rating.
