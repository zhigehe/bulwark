Investing.com - Investors may have an opportunity to buy the dip in this cosmetics stock, as it remains a standout performer despite a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter in North America.L’Oréal posted 2.5% organic revenue growth in the final quarter of 2024, falling 1.5 percentage points short of market expectations. The miss was driven by softness in its Luxe division in the United States, which slowed by 4-5 percentage points. However, analysts at Bank of America remain bullish, citing record-high operating margins and a strong earnings beat.“Despite a top-line miss, L’Oréal delivered an all-time high EBIT margin of 20% in 2024, with EPS beating consensus by 4%,” analysts at Bank of America said in a note, reiterating their “Buy” rating and €420 price target—implying an 18% upside from current levels.L’Oréal’s 2025 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26x is about 15% below its historical average, making it more attractive compared to premium consumer goods stocks. Additionally, its premium over other high-quality compounders has largely eroded, standing well below the 30% historical average.Despite headwinds in the U.S., L’Oréal maintained strong performance in other regions, with sequential acceleration in Europe, Latin America, and SAPMENA (South Asia Pacific, Middle East, and North Africa). The company’s Dermatological Beauty division also outperformed, posting 5% growth.Analysts at Bank of America expect L’Oréal to confirm 2025 market growth in line with pre-pandemic levels, around 4%, and believe the company will outperform its sector peers. They also note three one-off headwinds in the first quarter of 2025, including IT phasing adjustments, strong China sell-in, and sun care inventory shifts.With strong fundamentals and a temporary U.S. setback, L’Oréal remains a top pick for long-term investors, according to Bank of America. The firm included L’Oréal in its “25 stocks for 2025” list, signaling confidence in the brand’s resilience and ability to navigate short-term volatility.
