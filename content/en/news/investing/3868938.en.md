Investing.com - Shares of Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) jumped 10% in extended trading. The vacation home rentals company posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and issued an upbeat revenue forecast for the first quarter of this year on the back of strong travel demand.   
The company reported Q4 per share profit of $0.73 surpassing analysts' estimates of $0.59. Revenue for the quarter came in at $2.48 billion, ahead of Wall Street’s expectation of $2.43 billion.  
Airbnb expects revenue in the range of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion for the first quarter of 2025, while analyst estimates are at $2.3 billion.Airbnb said its "Nights and Experiences Booked" metric saw its highest growth of 2024 in Q4, contributing to a record 491 million bookings for the year and nearly $82 billion in gross booking value. "We successfully outpaced the travel industry’s growth. We’re continuing to build on this momentum in 2025," the company said in a statement adding, since its IPO in 2020 Airbnb tripled both revenue and GBV.
