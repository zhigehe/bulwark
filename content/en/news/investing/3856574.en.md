The emergence of DeepSeek’s R1 model has disrupted the global AI trade, triggering competitive responses from industry leaders such as Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5-Max and OpenAI’s o3-mini and Deep Research. DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 models are “highly impressive" and likely represent more than just an infrastructure optimization breakthrough, Bernstein analysts said in a Friday note.However, industry experts remain divided on whether DeepSeek’s models truly broke new ground compared to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which launched five months earlier.“Enough circumstantial evidence exists (including in our own use) that suggests they substantially leveraged existing state-of-the-art models (e.g. OpenAI’s), and optimized for a narrower range of capabilities,” analysts noted.A key takeaway from DeepSeek’s rise is the accelerated pace of AI development. Bernstein analysts highlight the "speed of iteration in AI" and the ability of distilled models to deliver "good enough" performance at significantly lower costs. This dynamic could lead to shorter product cycles and fragmentation in the AI model space, benefiting companies with unique user data and strong monetization channels.Despite the buzz, DeepSeek and other AI assistants do not yet appear to be disrupting China’s dominant internet platforms. "The top AI assistant apps are used around five times a day, for either side of ten minutes," analysts said, which remains far below engagement levels seen on major platforms like WeChat and Douyin. Still, AI-driven search tools could reshape digital ad revenue distribution, with Bernstein noting that AI-powered assistants might catalyze a "realignment of search ad revenues relative to daily query volumes."The implications of DeepSeek’s success extend beyond software. Its integration with Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip suggests it could play a role in AI hardware development within China. While semiconductor constraints remain a concern, Bernstein analysts believe China’s robust pipeline of AI talent will enable it to navigate these challenges.The AI landscape is shifting, but industry structure and competition remain critical factors. "We consider China a fertile market for the development and monetization of AI-enabled applications," analysts write. According to Bernstein, Tencent and Bytedance are positioned as long-term AI winners due to their expansive user ecosystems, while companies reliant on e-commerce face the risk that competitive pressures could limit AI-driven gains.All in all, DeepSeek’s emergence underlines a broader transformation in AI economics. “To quote an industry contact we spoke with post DeepSeek, “it’s always been possible to get 90% of the performance for 10% of the cost”… but development of bleeding edge models is what has driven the colossal capex numbers announced across the global Internet sector,” the report notes. This could lead to a shortening of frontier model shelf lives and increasing commoditization of AI capabilities.For investors, Bernstein warns against extreme sentiment swings, advocating a measured approach as the AI sector continues to evolve rapidly.
