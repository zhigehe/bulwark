Morgan Stanley has highlighted three key drivers propelling the humanoid market, identifying the near-term catalysts investors should watch.According to the firm's Friday report, the humanoid market is expected to be significantly boosted by the start of mass production in 2025, with major companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 1X, Agility, and UBTECH gearing up for large-scale manufacturing. This development is anticipated to contribute to the market's expansion, with projections indicating that China's humanoid market could reach between RMB1 trillion and RMB6 trillion by 2050, and the US market could generate up to $1 trillion in revenue by the same year.Morgan Stanley pointed out the performance of value chain enablers, particularly component manufacturers, who have seen an 84% increase in stock prices since September 2024. This outpaces both humanoid integrators and the broader MSCI China index. The bank’s analysts said this performance has been driven by “a flurry of catalysts and production expectations, despite the likelihood that volume ramp-up will take time in the initial years.”Morgan Stanley also identifies three types of catalysts that could further support stock price rallies in the humanoid sector: strong government support, major corporate and humanoid model updates, and advancements in key technologies. Government policies in China have played a crucial role in fostering industry growth, with various government bodies announcing plans in early 2023 to accelerate the sector's development. “Thereafter, local governments announced more solid policies to develop local supply chains, promote downstream applications, and provide the necessary capital to support new startups,” the analysts noted.“This government support — which historically has proven to be instrumental in the development of new industries in China, such as EV and other new energy — has bolstered sentiment and the market,” they added. The second key catalyst is the companies' humanoid advancements, such as Tesla's Optimus and Huawei's Pangu LBM.“The long term views of key industry leaders can provide important guidance on market size and adoption pathways, and have the potential to move the market significantly,” the analysts continued. For instance, related stocks jumped after Elon Musk set a goal of delivering 500,000 to 1 million humanoid units by 2027, and again when Jensen Huang announced that the "ChatGPT moment had arrived."Lastly, technological advancements, particularly in the AI space, are also seen as pivotal for the evolution of humanoid autonomy and the expansion of their applications.“As robots evolve from tele-ops to full autonomy, artificial intelligence/large model may become even more important than mechanical structure, in our view,” the analysts said. The rise of ChatGPT and Deepseek is crucial for the humanoid industry, as it could speed up the advancement of general autonomy and expand potential downstream applications.
