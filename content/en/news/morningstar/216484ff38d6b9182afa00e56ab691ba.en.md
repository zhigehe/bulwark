"Our newest tour offerings showcase what our data suggests travelers are seeking—not simply guided visits to iconic locations, but transformative experiences that unlock the full potential of each destination," said Sean Finelli, CEO and co-founder of The Tour Guy. "Through countless surveys and conversations with customers, we can conclude that there is an unprecedented interest in our specialized tours that offer a unique element, such as access to restricted areas, before and after-hours visits, and anything that has the potential to incite a viral moment."

The most sought-after experiences for 2025 also reflect [trends](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=3613465147&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelpulse.com%2Fnews%2Fdestinations%2Feuropean-travel-trends-to-look-for-in-2025&a=trends) identified by the company that will define European travel this year, including day trips, culinary experiences, major monuments, and more. These experiences include:

* [Tower of London Historic "Closing Ceremony" After Hours Tour](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=2297595964&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftours%2Flondon%2Ftower-of-london-after-hours-tour%3Fgallery%3Dtrue&a=Tower+of+London+Historic+%22Closing+Ceremony%22+After+Hours+Tour) – During this tour, travelers enter the Tower of London after hours to witness the centuries-old Ceremony of the Keys, a nightly tradition dating back to the 14th century. Filming is prohibited, so you won't see this ceremony anywhere else. This is among the most unique London tours travelers can book.
* [Pompeii, Positano, Amalfi Coast Day Trip from Rome](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=1882908691&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftours%2Frome%2Frome-to-pompeii-day-trip%3Fgallery%3Dtrue&a=Pompeii%2C+Positano%2C+Amalfi+Coast+Day+Trip+from+Rome) – Instead of planning trips to alternative locations, travelers are leaning more into day trips from major cities. One of the most popular Rome tours of this variety is seeing Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast in a single day. Travel in luxury from Rome to explore the ancient ruins of Pompeii on a guided tour, then continue to the picturesque beauty of Positano before returning to the city.
* [Florence Evening Food Tour](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=349654534&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftours%2Fflorence%2Fflorence-steak-dinner-walking-guided-food-wine-tasting-tour%3Fgallery%3Dtrue&a=Florence+Evening+Food+Tour) – Culinary experiences – like this evening food tour of Florence—are on the rise. According to recent company sales data, food tour bookings are up over 206% in 2025 compared to this time last year. Food tours allow travelers to take newfound knowledge of the local cuisine and apply it to the rest of their trip. Plus, expert food tour guides can give recommendations on what restaurants travelers won't want to miss.
* [Paris in a Day Tour with Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and Notre Dame Cathedral](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=3198323200&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftours%2Fparis%2Fparis-in-a-day-tour%3Fgallery%3Dtrue&a=Paris+in+a+Day+Tour+with+Eiffel+Tower%2C+Louvre%2C+and+Notre+Dame+Cathedral) – Despite the "destination dupe" trend that grabbed headlines in 2024, travelers aren't skipping tried-and-true destinations. Paris remains a top spot for The Tour Guy, with bookings for the city up 86% year-over-year. Sales are driven by high demand for Paris tours like this one that include top attractions like the Eiffel Tour and Louvre.
* [Jubilee Year Tours in Rome](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=3595553312&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftours%2Fjubilee-year-tours&a=Jubilee+Year+Tours+in+Rome) – The 2025 Jubilee is poised to draw an estimated 30 million pilgrims and curious onlookers from every corner of the globe. In fact, according to the company, bookings for its top-selling Vatican tour are up nearly 168% compared to this time last year.

What sets the company apart from other travel experience providers is its commitment to exceptional quality and authenticity. Unlike traditional tour marketplaces, The Tour Guy owns and operates many of its tours, ensuring complete control over the experience. Each tour is led by carefully selected tour guides who combine deep historical knowledge with engaging storytelling abilities.

"Our guides are licensed, local experts who have gone through years of education to prepare them to run tours. They include archeologists, published historians, PhDs... every single one of them knows how to tell a great story and can transform every moment on a guided tour into an unforgettable memory," added Finelli.

As thought leaders in experiential travel, The Tour Guy continues to innovate with specialized experiences that go beyond standard tourist offerings. This includes exclusive access to restricted areas, intimate after-hours visits, and meaningful interactions with local communities. The company also provides a comprehensive [free online guidebook](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357492-1&h=2309262542&u=https%3A%2F%2Fthetourguy.com%2Ftravel-blog%2F&a=free+online+guidebook), ensuring travelers have expert insights into the best things to see, do, eat, and drink at each destination.
