PRESS RELEASE - 14/02/2025, 09:30 CET

  
**Biocartis announces new data on early CAR-T vector load assessment with Idylla™ presented at ASTCT:** **A Potential Breakthrough in LBCL Treatment Monitoring**

**Mechelen, Belgium, 14 February 2025** – Biocartis NV (“Biocartis”), an innovative molecular diagnostics company, is pleased to announce that new research on the prototype Idylla™ CD19 CAR-T vector load Assay was presented as a poster at ASTCT in Honolulu, HI, US, on 13 February 2025.

The new study1 (Bharadwaj et al, 20252) demonstrated that early CD19 CAR-T vector load quantification in peripheral blood may improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and toxicity management for patients receiving axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) for Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL).

The study enrolled **100 patients** undergoing axi-cel therapy. Blood samples were analyzed using both droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) centrally, and local testing in the 3 centers with the prototype Idylla™ CAR-T Assay on the Idylla™ Platform. The study positioned the Idylla™ Platform as an automated, local hospital testing system that can provide results in approximately 90 minutes with only 2 minutes of hands-on time, straight from 0.5 ml of blood. The results revealed a 98.6% concordance between the prototype Idylla™ CAR-T Assay and ddPCR, confirming its reliability as a potential early alternative to standard methods.

Key Findings:

* **Early CAR-T Vector load increase** **predicted severe ICANS**: Patients experiencing a steep rise in CD19 CAR-T vector load within the **first 5 days** post-infusion were more likely to develop severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).
* **Day 3 Idylla™ measurements predicted ICANS severity**: Predictive modeling identified day 3 vector load as a significant predictor of ICANS severity using Idylla™.
* **Correlation with Progression-Free Survival (PFS)**: Patients were stratified into high and low vector load slope groups obtained during the first 5 days after infusion, with significant differences in PFS observed for both Idylla™ and ddPCR measurement methods. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed PFS rates separate **by day 50 (100% vs. 70%),** and persisted until the end of follow-up beyond **day 300 (90% vs. 50%)** for high vs. low vector load increases.

These findings suggest that, once approved, local hospital testing with **Idylla™ could revolutionize toxicity management and treatment monitoring in CAR-T therapy**. By providing real-time, accessible vector load measurements, clinicians may better predict toxicity risk, personalize treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes.

**W. Michael Korn, M.D., Chief Medical and Scientific Officer of Biocartis**, commented: *“These findings underscore the power of early, local hospital testing in CAR-T therapy. By providing real-time insights into CAR-T expansion dynamics, Idylla™ may enable clinicians to better predict toxicity risks and optimize treatment strategy - ultimately improving patient outcomes.”*
