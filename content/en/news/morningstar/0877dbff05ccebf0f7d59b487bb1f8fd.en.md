"The addition of cutting-edge technology is a contributing factor in our continued success," Sannella said.

*U.S. News and World Report* considered five factors in its evaluation: Engagement, Faculty Credentials and Training, Student Excellence, Services and Technology and Peer Assessment.

To get a sense of what goes into the rankings, consider this:

* By measuring engagement, the ranking considers the opportunities online students have to interact with instructors and classmates in similar ways as students do on campus.
* A survey of high-ranking academic officials in peer business schools allows for *U.S. News and World Report* to account for intangible factors that affect program quality and are not captured by statistics.
* The faculty credential and training factor considers whether online programs have instructors with academic credentials that match those for campus-based programs. It also determines whether faculty are trained to teach students remotely.
* The measure of student excellence considers if the online programs can have greater legitimacy in the job market while the services and technologies factor is a measure of the support structures in place to help students.
