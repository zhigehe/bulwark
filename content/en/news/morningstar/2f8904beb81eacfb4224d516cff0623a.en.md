Fund-of-funds like GCM Grosvenor, as well as leading Black- and women-led firms such as Fairview Capital and Illumen Capital extend the investor pool. Family offices are well-represented, including Pivotal Ventures, Verdis Investments, Gingerbread Capital and Hunt Holdings.

The investor base is enriched by corporate and financial institutions, notably Citi Impact Fund, MassMutual through its First Fund Initiative, venture firm Motley Fool Ventures and mission-based investors such as Mercy Investment Services.
