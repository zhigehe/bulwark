(NYSE American: SSY) today announced a loss from continuing operations of $1,070,000 (or a loss of $0.15 per fully diluted share) for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $407,000 (or a loss of $0.06 per fully diluted share) for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $100,000 to write down the value of the net assets of its information technology business which sold in January 2025.

Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was $1,343,000 (or a loss of $0.19 per fully diluted share) compared to a net loss of $3,075,000 (or a loss of $0.44 per fully diluted share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2025 included a loss from discontinued operations of $273,000 (or a loss of $0.04 fully diluted share), which includes a loss of $110 on the sale of real estate in Houston, Mississippi. The net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 included a loss from discontinued operations of $2,668,000 (or a loss of $0.38 per fully diluted share), which includes for the quarter an impairment loss of $2,032,000 on the sale of the Trace Regional Hospital, a vacant medical office building and three (3) patient clinics and a loss from operations of $636,000, primarily from operations of Trace Regional Hospital (prior to its sale) and a nursing home in Houston, Mississippi.

Consolidated net revenues for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $7,935,000 and $8,510,000, respectively, which consisted primarily of pharmacy net revenues. Pharmacy net revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 decreased $575,000, or 7%, from the same period last year. The pharmacy business had lower retail pharmacy scripts and durable medical equipment orders filled this year.

SunLink reported an operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 of $1,012,000 compared to an operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 of $433,000.

SunLink reported a loss from continuing operations of $1,512,000 (or a loss of $0.21 per fully diluted share) for its six months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $835,000 (or $0.12 per fully diluted share) for the six months ended December 31, 2023. Net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024 was $1,892,000 (or a loss of $0.27 per fully diluted share) compared to a net loss of $4,419,000 (or $0.63 per fully diluted share) for the six months ended December 31, 2023. The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024 included a loss from discontinued operations of $380,000 (or a loss of $0.05 per fully diluted share), compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $3,584,000 (or a loss of $0.51 per fully diluted share) for the six months ended December 31, 2023. The discontinued operations loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024 includes a loss of $110,000 on the October 2024 property sale in Houston, Mississippi. The discontinued operations loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023 included an impairment loss of $2,032,000 on the sale of the Trace Regional Hospital, a vacant medical office building and three (3) patient clinics and loss from operations of $1,552,000, primarily from Trace Regional Hospital (prior to its sale) and a nursing home in Houston, Mississippi. Consolidated net revenues for each of the six months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $15,858,000 and $17,065,000, respectively. Pharmacy net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2023 included $380,000 from the reversal of reserves for certain sales taxes previously accrued. Excluding the effect of the reversal of sales tax accruals, net revenues decreased 5% in the six months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year due primarily to decreased volume of Retail pharmacy scripts filled.

SunLink reported an operating loss for the six months ended December 31, 2024 of $2,206,000 compared to an operating loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023 of $883,000. The operating loss during the comparable six month period last year resulted primarily from the lower net revenues partially offset by the reversal of $380,000 in accrued sales tax reserves.

**Merger**

On January 6, 2025, the Company and Regional Health Properties, Inc. (“Regional”) jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “merger agreement”), dated January 3, 2025 pursuant to which the Company will mergewith and into Regional (the “merger”) in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 1,410,000 shares of Regional common stock and 1,410,000 shares of Regional’s newly-authorized Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $10 per share. The merger has been approved unanimously by each company’s board of directors and completion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of the approvals of the shareholders of both Regional and the Company, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

The Company continues to experience post-COVID-19 pandemic after-effects in its quarter and believes it will likely to continue experience these effects on its assets and operations in the foreseeable future particularly from salaries and wages pressure, workforce shortages, supply chain disruption and broad inflationary pressures. Our ability to make estimates of any such continuing effects on future revenues, expenses or changes in accounting judgments that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements is very limited, depending as they do on the severity and length thereof; as well as any further government actions and/or regulatory changes intended to address such effects.
