NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”) and KSF partner, former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until **March 24, 2025** to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Crocs, Inc. (NasdaqGS: CROX), if they purchased the Company’s shares between November 3, 2022, and October 28 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

About the Lawsuit

Crocs and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

In February 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of HEYDUDE, a footwear brand focusing on casual, comfortable, and lightweight footwear. On October 29, 2024, the Company reported its financial results for 3Q 2024, disclosing that HEYDUDE revenues fell below the Company’s expectations and that “HEYDUDE’s recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the business to turn the corner” due to “excess inventories in the market,” among other things.

On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $26.47 per share, or approximately 19.2%, from a close of $138.05 per share on October 28, 2024, to close at $111.58 per share on October 29, 2024.

The case is *Carretta v. Crocs, Inc., et al.*, No. 25-cv-00096.
