*A first-of-its-kind Super Bowl moment blends an anthemic ad with a live stadium singalong, uniting Americans in a call to come home*

DETROIT, Feb. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT), the Detroit-based fintech platform company consisting of mortgage, real estate and personal finance businesses, tonight launched its *Own the Dream* integrated marketing campaign during the second quarter of Super Bowl LIX. The company's ad spot turned into a nationwide singalong, bringing millions of Americans together.

The 60-second ad is a tribute to the meaning of home. Set to a reimagined version of John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads," it captures everyday Americans returning to the places that matter most – from children playing in backyard sprinklers to veterans reuniting with loved ones.

As the final words, "Everyone deserves their shot at the American Dream. Own the Dream." filled the screen, Rocket delivered a Super Bowl first. The stadium became part of the story. When the broadcast returned to the game, more than 65,000 fans at Caesars Superdome broke into a live singing of John Denver's anthem.

"From the start, this was more than a commercial. We set out to create a moment that captures the raw, emotional journey of chasing a dream that once felt out of reach," said Jonathan Mildenhall, Chief Marketing Officer of Rocket. "For many Americans, that is homeownership – the foundation for financial security, prosperity and a better future. Tonight, we reminded America that home is something to believe in, fight for and make a reality for everyone."

The *Own the Dream* ad was created by independent award-winning agency, Mirimar, in collaboration with Rocket's in-house creative team, and directed by Matthew Dillon Cohen in his Super Bowl debut. The ad and following historic singalong seamlessly blended emotion and spectacle.

The Super Bowl campaign underscores Rocket's mission to help make owning a home more accessible for Americans. *Own the Dream* builds on Rocket's 40-year legacy and newly rebranded visual identity, marking the next chapter in the brand's evolution and showcasing how homeownership can unite the nation.
