**DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:**

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) IAS was experiencing increased competitive pricing pressures and, as a result, IAS had been forced to cut prices to compensate for weakening demand and slowing revenue growth; (2) IAS's pricing function was no longer "favorable" and IAS could not sustain its pricing or drive price increases; (3) pricing had become a key differentiator between IAS and its competitor, and IAS's "favorable" pricing became necessary to close major renewals and new deals; (4) the risk that competition "could result in increased pricing pressure" or "could put pressure on us to change our prices" had in fact transpired; and (5) as a result, Defendants' statements about the company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:**

IAS investors may, ***no later than March 31, 2025,*** seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through [Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362838-1&h=1883065810&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ktmc.com%2Fnew-cases%2Fintegral-ad-science-holding-corp%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dias%26mktm%3Dr&a=Kessler+Topaz+Meltzer+%26+Check%2C+LLP) or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
