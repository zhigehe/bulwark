Producers of metals and other raw materials rose after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony was not as hawkish as some had feared, weighing on the dollar.

Powell testified to Congress that the central bank was in no hurry to continue cutting rates, availing of time afforded by the resilience of the U.S. economy. The Fed chairman said the central bank was still concerned about inflation, reinforcing speculation that the central bank's next move could be a rate increase.

Steelmaker ArcelorMittal said it is looking at the possibility of moving some business-support activities to India from Europe to cut costs in the face of a challenging backdrop for the European steel industry.
