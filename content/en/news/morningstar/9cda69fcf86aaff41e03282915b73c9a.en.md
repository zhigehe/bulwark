**Hillary Savoie, Chief Banking Officer, Wins “2025 Women of Influence: Finance” Honors by Los Angeles Business Journal**

*The dynamic executive is celebrated for her innovative leadership and transformative vision for the commercial business bank.*

Hillary Savoie, Managing Director and Chief Banking Officer for SMBC MANUBANK, was named one of the “2025 Women of Influence: Finance” by the Los Angeles Business Journal.

With over 30 years’ experience in the financial services industry, Ms. Savoie has been the driving force behind SMBC MANUBANK’s transformation from a Los Angeles community bank into a trusted powerhouse and a leading lender in franchise finance, commercial real estate, diversified industries, and trust and estate services.

“I’m honored to be among such a prestigious group of industry leaders reshaping the landscape of finance in Los Angeles,” said Ms. Savoie. “I have to give credit for this award in large part to the dedication of my Commercial Banking Unit colleagues and their commitment to our clients.”

As the commercial bank’s first Chief Banking Officer, Ms. Savoie is responsible for all client, marketing, and product development-related activities for Commercial and Business Banking operations, including the Japan/Asia Business Division.

Kazuhisa Miyagawa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our entire organization applauds Hillary for this well-deserved recognition and is proud of her ongoing success transforming SMBC MANUBANK’s commercial banking unit.”

Ms. Savoie joined the bank’s executive leadership team in 2023, the same year it officially kicked off the transformation by rebranding from Manufacturers Bank to SMBC MANUBANK. Key aspects of the ongoing initiative include continuous investments in people, technology, and processes to enhance the bank’s high-touch, high-engagement business model and elevate the client experience.

The Los Angeles Business Journal, which reaches over 70K influential readers monthly, published a profile of Ms. Savoie on Feb. 10, 2025 in its annual “Women of Influence: Finance” issue.
