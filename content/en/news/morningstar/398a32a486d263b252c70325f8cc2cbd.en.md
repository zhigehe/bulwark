0255 GMT - Iron ore gains in Asian trading. The steelmaking ingredient may find some support thanks to strong near-term demand and supply dynamics, Nanhua Futures analysts say in commentary. Demand is likely to improve as Chinese steel factories resume production after the Lunar New Year holiday, they add. Investors will closely watch end-user demand for steel while digesting Trump's 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports into the U.S. The most-traded iron-ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is up 0.9% at CNY819.0/ton.
