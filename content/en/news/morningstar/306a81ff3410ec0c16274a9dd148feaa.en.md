MEDIA ADVISORY/PHOTO OP: **Time and location of strike votes in Calgary**

Education support workers at five Alberta school districts will be voting to strike over the coming days. Media are welcome to film or capture images from the following polling locations.

Local 40 (Calgary Board of Education)

Dates: February 10th and 11th
  
Time: 9:00am to 9:00pm
  
Location: Local 40 office, 811 Manning Road NE, Calgary

Local 520 (Calgary Catholic School District)

Dates: February 10th and 11th
  
Time: 9:00 am to 9:00 pm
  
Location: CUPE Local 37 Office, 5112 3 St SE

Please note: Three other locals are also conducting strike votes, but are using an electronic balloting system.

“Our members do not wish to strike,” said CUPE Alberta President Rory Gill. “But many feel they have no other option in the face of poverty level wages, shrinking classroom resources, and a provincial government that refuses to act.”
