**Sourcepoint Unveils Transaction Receipts and Legal Preferences** **to Unify Privacy Choice Management**

*New Capabilities Create Single Source of Truth for Consumer Privacy Choices and Legal Policy Acknowledgement, Enabling Confident First-Party Data Activation*

Sourcepoint, the privacy software leader trusted by the most influential brands, today announced two major features of its Universal Consent & Preferences platform: Legal Preferences and Transaction Receipts. Built on Sourcepoint's flexible Dialogue platform, these capabilities enable organizations to confidently activate their first-party data while maintaining comprehensive records of privacy choices, legal document acknowledgments, and marketing preferences across their digital properties.

Legal Preferences enable organizations to maintain a central repository for all types of legal policies, terms and disclosures with robust version control, while Transaction Receipts provide a complete, searchable record of all privacy-relevant user interactions, including marketing preferences. This unified approach is particularly important as 2025 brings unprecedented complexity in privacy regulation and litigation, with expanding definitions of sensitive data, novel compliance requirements around AI and automated decision-making, increasingly granular consumer privacy controls, and increased risk exposure from privacy lawsuits. For marketing teams, these capabilities provide instant verification of consent status before campaign execution, ensuring valuable first-party data can be activated confidently and compliantly.

"As privacy regulations proliferate and become more nuanced across jurisdictions, enterprises need sophisticated systems to verify user privacy choices and manage compliance across their entire ecosystem," said Ben Barokas, CEO of Sourcepoint. "Our platform transforms fragmented document and consent management into a unified system of record, enabling organizations to build trust while reducing operational complexity and unlocking the full potential of their first-party data."

Key capabilities include:

**Legal Preferences:**

* Centralized library of all user-facing legal policies, terms and disclosures, including privacy policies, terms of use, and promotional terms.
* Version control with automated tracking of policy updates
* Ability to trigger notices when policies change
* Support for global templates with regional customization
* Integration with consent workflows to ensure proper documentation of user acknowledgements

**Transaction Receipts:**

* Comprehensive record of user interactions including:
  + Legal policy acknowledgements
  + Sensitive data processing consent
  + Age verification records
  + AI feature opt-ins
  + Email subscriptions
* Detailed timestamps and version tracking for all user privacy choices
* Searchable database with unique transaction identifiers
* Real-time consent verification across platforms
* Support for complex multi-brand deployments
* Visibility across owned & operated channels (web, mobile, CTV)

"This release represents a significant advancement in privacy choice management," said Julie Rubash, Chief Privacy Officer and General Counsel at Sourcepoint. "Organizations face increasing pressure to demonstrate compliance with evolving regulations including sensitive data requirements, AI governance, and clear, consistent and up-to-date privacy disclosures. Our platform enables them to manage these complex requirements while maintaining detailed records of user acknowledgements and consent choices. This is particularly crucial as we see state regulators stepping up enforcement activities, new sector-specific privacy laws coming into effect and increasing exposure from the plaintiffâ€™s bar."

The Dialogue platform's flexibility enables organizations to quickly adapt to new regulatory requirements and use cases, from demonstrating compliance with automated decision-making regulations to documenting user privacy choices for sensitive data processing. The platform's modular architecture supports customized deployment of privacy notices and consent collection workflows while maintaining comprehensive records through the Legal Preferences and Transaction Receipts features.

Reflecting a growing focus on vendor management and downstream accountability, the platform helps organizations maintain detailed audit trails of legal policy acknowledgements, consent records, and marketing preferences across their technology ecosystem. This comprehensive documentation is crucial as U.S. state privacy laws increasingly emphasize vendor oversight and data protection requirements.

The Legal Preferences and Transaction Receipts features are now available to existing Sourcepoint clients using the Universal Consent & Preferences platform.
