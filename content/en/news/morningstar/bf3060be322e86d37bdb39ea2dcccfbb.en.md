**Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation Announces Pricing of Public Offering by Selling Stockholder**

Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation (NYSE:ZWS) (“Zurn Elkay”) today announced the pricing of the previously announced underwritten public offering by a certain former Elkay stockholder, Ice Mountain LLC (the “selling stockholder”), of 7,750,000 shares of Zurn Elkay’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“common stock”), at a price to the public of $35.00 per share. The offering is expected to close on February 13, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

Zurn Elkay has agreed to repurchase from the underwriters 1,636,905(or approximately $55,000,000) of such shares of common stock at a price per share equal to the price per share paid by the underwriter to the selling stockholder in the offering. The underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,162,500 shares of common stock from the selling stockholder. The selling stockholder will receive all of the net proceeds from the offering. No shares are being sold by Zurn Elkay in the offering.

Ice Mountain LLC acquired its shares in Zurn Elkay as a result of the combination of Zurn and Elkay in 2022. Ice Mountain LLC’s holdings in Zurn Elkay represent the interests of those members of the Katz family (the founding family of Elkay) who owned a controlling interest in Elkay (a family-owned business formed in 1920) immediately before merging with Zurn. The family members that Ice Mountain LLC represents have expressed their desire to continue to be a significant investor in Zurn Elkay for the long-term, with no current plans to further diversify its remaining holdings, and as such, Ice Mountain LLC has entered into a lock-up agreement for its remaining shares that expires October 31, 2026.

Evercore ISI is acting as the lead joint book-running manager. Baird is acting as an additional book-running manager. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank Securities, Mizuho, Oppenheimer & Co., and Stifel are acting as co-managers for the offering.
