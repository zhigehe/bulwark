With over 125 years of hair expertise, Schwarzkopf® is bringing professional quality color to all with a new lineup of Schwarzkopf® Keratin Root Permanent Color and Keratin Root Temporary Color & Thickening Spray. The Schwarzkopf® Keratin Root Permanent Color is a permanent color treatment that refreshes the root of the hair by providing 100% gray coverage in just 10 minutes, leaving hair looking strong and healthy. The Schwarzkopf® Keratin Root Permanent Color kit contains the brand's exclusive bond enforcing system and a salon inspired 3-sided brush for precise application.

Also new to the market, Schwarzkopf® Keratin Root Temporary Color & Thickening Spray with Keratin and Vitamin E.  This temporary root color spray instantly delivers up to 100% gray coverage and is scalp friendly. The formula is non-irritating and ammonia-free, and the non-sticky hold formula is delivered evenly and finely. This formulation helps ensure precise color application without mixing or mess that dries quickly and will wash out with your next shampoo. Both products are available in three shades (Black, Dark Brown and Light Brown) and are designed for all hair types and textures.
