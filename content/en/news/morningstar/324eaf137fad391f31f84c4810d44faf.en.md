By Mike Murphy

President Donald Trump said Sunday he will announce 25% tariffs against all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. on Monday.

He added that he plans to announce a series of reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday. Trump said on Friday that reciprocal tariffs were forthcoming - potentially against imports from China, Japan, the European Union and Taiwan, among other countries.

Trump did not say when the tariffs will take effect. He has already imposed additional 10% tariffs against goods made in China, and paused the imposition of 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico for a month.

This is a developing report that will be updated.
