Nestle reported its weakest annual organic sales growth in more than two decades, hit by a pullback in consumer spending after years of high inflation.

The Swiss maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee said Thursday that organic sales grew 2.2% in 2024.

The figure marks a sharp slowdown from the organic sales growth of 7.2% Nestle reported for 2023 and compares with analysts' expectations of 2.1%, according to consensus estimates provided by the company.

The results showed Nestle's organic sales grew at a slower pace last year than during the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis. The company attributed the performance to a soft consumer demand and a challenging economic context, although it said sales growth strengthened during the year to 2.3% in the second half from 2.1% in the first.

Nestle generated full-year sales of 91.35 billion Swiss francs, equivalent to $99.98 billion, down 1.8% on a reported basis compared with 2023.

Real internal growth, the company's key measure of sales volume, was 0.8%, returning to positive territory after contracting in 2023. Pricing contributed 1.5% to sales growth, it said. The company said coffee was the largest contributor, with mid-single-digit growth.

Nestle is attempting a turnaround under Chief Executive Laurent Freixe to revive sales growth amid a tough environment for consumer-facing companies. The group began to ease the pace of price hikes in 2024 after acknowledging that hard-pressed shoppers had fled to cheaper brands.

Consumer-goods companies raised prices in recent years to counter higher costs, but they have struggled to boost sales volumes while lifting prices as budget-conscious shoppers pulled back on purchases of branded products.

Higher costs for commodities like cocoa and coffee could hurt the profitability of companies like Nestle going forward, analysts say, and trade tariffs introduced by the Trump administration threaten to compound those pressures.

Freixe, a company veteran, in November set out plans to boost advertising-and-marketing investments and cut costs. He replaced longtime chief Mark Schneider in September, with the task of tackling slowing sales and a deterioration of the stock price.

Looking ahead, the company said it continues to expect 2025 sales growth to improve compared with last year, with increased investments driving growth. Underlying trading operating profit margin--Nestle's preferred earnings metric--is now expected at 16% or more compared with the previous guidance of slightly below 17%.

Analysts had forecast Nestle's organic sales growth for 2025 at 3.1% with an underlying trading operating profit margin of 16.2%, according to a consensus estimate provided by the company.

For 2024, underlying trading operating profit came in at 15.70 billion Swiss francs compared with 16.1 billion francs a year before, with a margin that contracted to 17.2% from 17.3%. Net profit fell to 10.88 billion francs from 11.21 billion francs.

The company declared a dividend of 3.05 francs a share, up from 3 francs the year before.
