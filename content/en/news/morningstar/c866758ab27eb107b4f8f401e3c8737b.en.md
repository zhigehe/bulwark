The Allegations: Rosen Law Firm is Investigating the Allegations that Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE: SUI) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Operations.

According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants created the false impression that they were presenting a complete and accurate picture of SUI’s financial reports and accounting pertaining to SUI’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth. At no point did defendants state or even allude to the DH Bingham Farms LLC mortgage, signed by Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gary Shiffman, or the multiple undisclosed loans CEO Gary Shiffman received, including one from SUI Board Member Arthur Weiss. Defendants misled investors by providing the public with materially flawed statements of confidence and growth projections throughout the Class Period, which did not account for these variables. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
