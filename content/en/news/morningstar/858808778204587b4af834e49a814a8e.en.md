Nabors Announces Fourth Quarter 2024 Results

Nabors Announces Fourth Quarter 2024 Results
--------------------------------------------

PR Newswire

HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 12, 2025


HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Nabors Industries Ltd. ("Nabors" or the "Company") (NYSE: NBR) today reported fourth quarter 2024 operating revenues of $730 million, compared to operating revenues of $732 million in the third quarter. The net loss attributable to Nabors shareholders for the quarter was $54 million, compared to a net loss of $56 million in the third quarter. This equates to a loss of $6.67 per diluted share, compared to a loss per diluted share of $6.86 in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $221 million, compared to $222 million in the previous quarter. 

Highlights

* Nabors shareholders approved the issuance of shares to Parker Wellbore ("Parker") stockholders in connection with the merger between Parker and Nabors. Parker shareholders also approved the merger. Pending certain international regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2025.
* Nabors received awards for three rigs in Argentina, two of which will be transferred from the U.S. on five-year contracts. The third rig is currently working in country and is scheduled to start its new contract before the end of the year. In addition, the Company received another award for an idle rig in Colombia. These reactivations are capital efficient opportunities to support growth, while improving Nabors' asset utilization.
* In the fourth quarter, SANAD deployed its ninth newbuild rig and is expected to start up two more in the first quarter of 2025. As Saudi Aramco continues to grow its natural gas activity, Nabors continues to participate in its customer's expansion plans with commitments to add rigs built in the Kingdom over the coming years and its leading portfolio of drilling-related services.
* In Rig Technologies, Canrig was awarded a comprehensive rig upgrade package by a third-party drilling contractor in the U.S. Canrig is currently pursuing a number of upgrade opportunities, both domestically and internationally. These projects demonstrate Canrig's advanced technology suite, which enables contractors to remain competitive as the drilling market becomes increasingly demanding.

Anthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, "We are looking forward to adding Parker to the Nabors portfolio. Our integration planning reinforces the Parker attributes that we identified earlier. We are confident that this acquisition will advance our strategic objectives while creating value for our stakeholders. 

"The market environment in the fourth quarter provided us with some challenges in the U.S., as operators continued to modulate their activity levels in oil basins, mainly driven by recent mergers. Leading edge pricing in this market remained steady, supporting our daily margins at relatively high levels. For 2025, we are planning for stable market activity through the early part of the year. Given this activity level, we are responding with actions to improve efficiency and align our cost structure.

"Our international businesses continued to expand in multiple markets, including Saudi Arabia and Argentina. Although our international success places pressure on our capital expenditures, these are attractive growth opportunities for multiyear contracts with high returns. In 2025, we have startups planned in the Kingdom, Argentina, Colombia, and Kuwait. We project these deployments will drive this segment's margins higher through the year.

"SANAD, our 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco, is progressively adding 50 rigs over approximately 10 years. Through 2024, SANAD has deployed nine of these units. The rigs work under six-year initial contracts that are structured to recover the invested capital over five years. This term is followed by a four-year renewal mechanism, providing at least 10 years of utilization. 

"In 2025, SANAD's working newbuild fleet should approximately double its contribution in adjusted EBITDA over 2024. SANAD's expansion remains one of our most exciting investment opportunities. We believe that in the next several years our joint venture will start generating cash flow in excess of the annual investment required for the newbuild rigs, meaningfully increasing value for Nabors as a whole."

Segment Results 

International Drilling adjusted EBITDA totaled $112.0 million, compared to $116.0 million in the third quarter. Average rig count met activity expectations as it increased slightly to 85 driven by rig additions in Argentina and Saudi Arabia, mostly offset by rig suspensions in the Kingdom. Daily adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter averaged $16,687 reflecting incremental costs associated with these rig start-ups and suspensions.

The U.S. Drilling segment reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $105.8 million, compared to $108.7 million in the third quarter. Nabors' fourth quarter Lower 48 average rig count totaled 66, versus 68 in the third quarter. In the Lower 48, daily margins held up well in the fourth quarter. Daily adjusted gross margin averaged $14,940, versus $15,051 in the prior quarter. Leading edge pricing remained stable as average day rates reflected contracts rolling to the latest prices. The change in average pricing was mostly offset by reductions in operating expenses.

Drilling Solutions adjusted EBITDA was $33.8 million. The segment's performance was impacted by Nabors' rig count in the Lower 48. Internationally, NDS activity remained strong. Drilling Solutions gross margin expanded, topping 54%.

Rig Technologies adjusted EBITDA reached $9.2 million, a 51% increase compared to the third quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher shipments of capital equipment in the Middle East. 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

In the fourth quarter, EBITDA was in line with the prior quarter. A strong improvement in Rig Technologies compensated for the decline in U.S. drilling activity. Consolidated adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was a use of $53 million, resulting in part from a temporary halt in payments by a client in Mexico and by higher capital expenditures.

William Restrepo, Nabors CFO, stated, "Two main factors impacted adjusted free cash flow. First, in Mexico, the collections shortfall totaled approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. Second, our capital expenses were $241 million, $10 million above our target. Although our capex outside SANAD was $30 million below our target, the JV's newbuild spending of $143 million exceeded our forecast by $40 million as its rig supplier continued to accelerate completion of construction milestones. 

"SANAD consumed $90 million in cash during the fourth quarter. Before SANAD's growth capital spending, its cash increased by $53 million. For the full year 2024, SANAD's cash declined by $52 million after funding the investment of $271 million in its newbuild program. This demonstrates that SANAD's cash increased by more than $200 million, highlighting the extraordinary strength of the existing fleet. 

"For the full year, we forecast capital spending of $710 to $720 million. Approximately $360 million of that total will be directed to SANAD newbuild construction.

"We are projecting 2025 consolidated adjusted free cash flow at just over breakeven. The expected use of cash in SANAD is approximately $150 million. This implies that Nabors outside SANAD would generate positive adjusted free cash flow of at least $150 million in 2025. This would give us the ability to reduce Nabors gross debt by a significant amount.

"None of these forecasts include the impact of Parker Wellbore. We believe the acquired business will provide incremental free cash flow to the combined company, even before the expected synergies of $35 million." 

Outlook

Nabors expects the following metrics for the first quarter of 2025 (these expectations exclude the impact of Parker Wellbore):

U.S. Drilling 

* Lower 48 average rig count of approximately 61 rigs
* Lower 48 daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $14,800
* Alaska and Gulf of Mexico combined adjusted EBITDA approximately in line with the fourth quarter of 2024

International

* Average rig count of 85-86 rigs
* Daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $17,000

Drilling Solutions 

* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $33 million

Rig Technologies

* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 million

Capital Expenditures 

* Capital expenditures of $195 - $205 million, with $80 - $85 million for the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia
* Full-year capital expenditures of approximately $710 - $720 million, with $360 million for the SANAD newbuilds

Adjusted Free Cash Flow 

* Adjusted free cash flow for 2025 of approximately breakeven, with SANAD consuming approximately $150 million, while the remaining operations should generate around $150 million

Mr. Petrello concluded, "Nabors commitment to advanced technology is helping us navigate this current environment. The addition of the Parker business will strengthen our position, especially in our Drilling Solutions segment. 

"Our investments today support our current operations as well as large scale growth, specifically in Saudi Arabia. Our opportunity in the Kingdom is unique in the drilling industry. It has potential for substantial cash generation as well as for transformational value creation for our shareholders."

Forward-looking Statements

The information included in this press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as disclosed by Nabors from time to time in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, Nabors' actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect management's estimates and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Nabors does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. 

Non-GAAP Disclaimer

This press release presents certain "non-GAAP" financial measures. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Adjusted operating income (loss) represents income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, investment income (loss), and other, net. Adjusted EBITDA is computed similarly, but also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. Net debt is calculated as total debt minus the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

Adjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash flow, after reinvesting in the company for future growth, that could be available for paying down debt or other financing cash flows, such as dividends to shareholders. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies.

Each of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and therefore should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss), net debt, and adjusted free cash flow, because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability, performance and liquidity. Securities analysts and investors also use these measures as some of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance. Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. Reconciliations of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, net debt to total debt, and adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operations, which are their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures, are included in the tables at the end of this press release. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of our outlook for Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Gross Margin or Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as the amount and significance of items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts. These special items could be meaningful.

| (1) | Includes our oilfield equipment manufacturing activities. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (2) | Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions related to our Rig Technologies operating segment. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (3) | Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), investment income (loss), interest expense, other, net and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability and performance.  Securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance.  Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently.  A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income (loss), which is the most closely comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table set forth immediately following the heading "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Net Income (Loss)". |

| (5) | Adjusted operating income (loss) represents net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), investment income (loss), interest expense  and other, net. Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted operating income (loss) excludes certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make.

| (6) | Rig revenue days represents the number of days the Company's rigs are contracted and performing under a contract during the period.  These would typically include days in which operating, standby and move revenue is earned. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (7) | Average rigs working represents a measure of the average number of rigs operating during a given period.  For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter.  On an annual period, one rig operating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year.  Average rigs working can also be calculated as rig revenue days during the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (8) | Daily rig revenue represents operating revenue, divided by the total number of revenue days during the quarter. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (9) | Daily adjusted gross margin represents operating revenue less direct costs, divided by the total number of rig revenue days during the quarter. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (10) | The U.S. Drilling segment includes the Lower 48, Alaska, and Gulf of Mexico operating areas. |

| (1) Adjusted operating income (loss) represents net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), investment income (loss), interest expense, and other, net. Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted operating income (loss) excludes certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company's ongoing profitability and performance.  Securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze the Company's performance.  Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently. |

| Adjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets.  Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the company's ability to generate cash flow, after reinvesting in the company for future growth, that could be available for paying down debt or other financing cash flows, such as dividends to shareholders.  Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.  Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations reported in accordance with GAAP. |
