NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025


* *The new duet alongside the king of romance is out now on all major streaming platforms*
* *Music video: [here](https://youtu.be/NaiRtGN-KP4)*

NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Barboltian, a video game character known for his starring role in *Clash Royale*, comes to life through a partnership between Sony Music Publishing and Supercell, distributed by The Orchard, to remake one of the greatest love songs of all time.  
  
Clash Royale is part of a franchise\* that has racked up 4 billion downloads and grossed over 14bn$. However, since it was released in 2016, Supercell (maker of the hit game) has seen some of its long-time players leave the game in recent years.

In response, the team connected with legendary Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Michael Bolton to reimagine one of his biggest hits and deliver a special message to fans for Valentine's Day. Mr. Bolton gave his blessing and worked with the Clash Royale team to create an epic new version of his beloved hit, *How Am I Supposed to Live Without You*.  
  
Duetting with Michael Bolton is Clash Royale's Barbarian, one of the most recognisable faces in video games. Channeling the spirit of classic 90s love songs, Barbarian has grown a mullet and extended his moustache handles. Barbarian no more - for a limited time, he has become Barboltian.

The song is [available to stream](https://tinyurl.com/Barboltian) from today on all major streaming platforms.

**Michael Bolton** said: *"How am I Supposed to Live Without You" has been a hit for me twice and I'm excited to see it land with a new generation through this collaboration with Barboltian."*

**Barboltian** said: *…nothing. He doesn't really talk, unless you count singing.*

Clash Royale is a fast-paced 1v1 strategy game where your aim is to destroy your opponent's Towers. To do this, you collect Cards and build a team from more than 100 powerful troops, which you command in the arena to try and outsmart your opponent. To join Barbarian (sorry… Barboltian) and millions of players worldwide in the Clash Royale arena, download the game on iOS or Android [here](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/).
