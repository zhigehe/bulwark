The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Regeneron paid credit card fees to distributors on the condition that those distributors did not charge purchasers of its Eylea drug more to use a credit card. The Company's payments subsidized the prices paid by Eylea customers. The Company's concession lowered Eylea's selling price. These concessions provided the Company with a competitive advantage that misleadingly boosted Eylea sales. The Company violated the False Claims Act by overstating the ASP of Eylea. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Regeneron, investors suffered damages.

[Join the case](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359115-1&h=2758312185&u=https%3A%2F%2Fschallfirm.com%2Fcases%2Fregeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-3%2F%23case-form&a=Join+the+case) to recover your losses.
