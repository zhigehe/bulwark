“This launch represents a major inflection point for our global defense and intelligence customer base as BlackSky introduces very high-resolution Gen-3 capabilities to our high-frequency, low-latency monitoring constellation,” said Brian O’Toole, BlackSky CEO. “As more Gen-3 satellites complete production, we expect a regular cadence of additional launches over the coming year.”

“Electron is a trusted and reliable constellation builder for companies like BlackSky, allowing them to be in control of how, when, and where to deploy their constellation. BlackSky is one of our earliest and longest-standing commercial satellite customers, and it’s great to be heading back to the pad with them once again to continue to advance and expand their constellation,” said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO.

As BlackSky’s constellation evolves with the regular addition of Gen-3 satellites, BlackSky will continue to optimize for increased constellation capacity and flexibility giving customers confidence in reliable access to services. Gen-3 customers will be able to conduct the automated detection, identification and classification of a wide library of vehicles, aircraft, vessels and other objects of tactical interest. These new capabilities will further enable BlackSky’s space-based intelligence applications for tactical ISR missions and strategic intelligence operations.
