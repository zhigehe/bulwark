HOUSTON, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- HOLBA celebrated the achievements of the top landlord representatives during its 26th Landlord Representative of the Year Award ceremony held at the Houston Country Club on February 12th, 2025. Leaders in the industry were recognized for their 2024 accomplishments with HOLBA's Landlord Representative of the Year, Deal of the Year, and Landlord Representative Rising Star awards.

*"HOLBA is proud to honor the leaders in the landlord representative industry," said Griff Bandy, President of HOLBA. "These exceptional professionals were acknowledged for their sizable and complex transactions, their involvement in the industry, and also in the communities they serve."* 

HOLBA's 2024 Landlord Representative of the Year was awarded to Jack Russo, Senior Vice President of Agency Leasing at JLL, who was acknowledged for his leadership in securing a 4.2 million square foot office portfolio in the Woodlands and closing an outstanding 87 deals throughout the year.

HOLBA's 2024 Deal of the Year was awarded to Nina Seyyedin and Warren Savery with CBRE for the Camden Property Lease. Nina and Warren facilitated the 104,000 SF lease at Williams Tower, securing floors 25 through 29 as their new headquarters, set to relocate in late 2025.
