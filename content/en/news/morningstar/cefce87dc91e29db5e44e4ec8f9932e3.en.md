SINGAPORE, Feb. 13, 2025


SINGAPORE, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtual Internet announced the launch of JioCinema and Virtual 5G Express Plus as a Joint Solution. This campaign, focused on JioCinema users, highlights another major service that becomes globally available and accessible as a result of Virtual 5G Express Plus.  This campaign will encompass an integrated media campaign shared across the social media and traditional media channels.

OTT

The OTT landscape in India has shown that the lines between digital and traditional broadcasting have merged. Digital platforms host live events, platforms have shifted towards local content as the Telco infrastructures which own these platforms are limited to local operations.

India has over 900 million internet users, the second largest online market in the world after China. As of 2025, 56% of all new Internet users come from India. According to the Government of India, NRIs, Non-Resident Indians  who reside outside of India, comprise the world's largest overseas population of people living and working abroad. Every year, 2.5 million Indians immigrate overseas, making India the nation with the highest annual number of emigrants in the world. This makes India a major part of the next wave of Global OTT Digital Subscriber, and it makes these OTT Users a focus for platforms like Virtual 5G Express Plus that enable global access to these OTT services.

ICC Champions Trophy 2025

The campaign follows the past success generated by popular sporting events such as Cricket. JioCinema reached 620 Million Viewers in IPL 2024, setting a new streaming record within India. Streaming platforms like JioTV and JioCinema were previously available, yet few people used to use them. The Indian Premier League (IPL) delivered its events via OTT and Digital Enabling Services and JioCinema single-handedly increased its penetration by streaming all the IPL matches for free. JioCinema leveraged the IPL period as a game-changer for [JioCinema](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362079-1&h=1375132475&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindubusinessline.com%2Fspecials%2Fcorporate-file%2Fhow-jio-is-powering-reliances-media-entertainment-biz%2Farticle68802732.ece&a=JioCinema), witnessing a fourfold increase in its penetration. In measuring the proportion of New Installs to Total Installs, Pre IPL installs of JioCinema were 27.52% but rose to 72.14% during the IPL period.

Following the demonstrated ability of Major Sporting Events to launch and accelerate installations, this Novel Solution Campaign will focus on the fast-approaching ICC Champions Trophy 2025, with over [1.5 Billion Viewers Worldwide](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362079-1&h=2230628425&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cricket.com%2Fnews%2Ficc-champions-trophy-to-be-broadcast-to-an-audience-of-15-billion&a=1.5+Billion+Viewers+Worldwide+) via dozens of Apps and Website's. The dozens of streaming services that will carry the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 are often limited to specific locales; JioCinema included. This joint solution of JioCinema and Virtual 5G Express Plus enables users of these OTT services by app and by website to enjoy unrestricted access to their favorite events using their chosen platform from anywhere in the world.
