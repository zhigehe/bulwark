If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 1, 2025.

The Newmont class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Newmont’s projected revenue outlook and ability to deliver growing gold and mineral production at its Tier 1 portfolio operations through mining and cost profile improvements; and (ii) defendants provided the public with materially flawed statements of confidence and growth projections which did not account for these variables.

Following this news, Newmont’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $57.74 per share on October 23, 2024 to $49.25 per share on October 24, 2024.

**Investor Action Steps:** Shareholders who incurred losses during the class period, have until **April 1, 2025**, to move the court to become a lead plaintiff in this action.A lead plaintiff will act on behalf of all other class members in directing the class-action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the class-action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share any potential future recovery of the class action lawsuit is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
