The announcement was made by Ron Shroder, FTI’s longtime CEO and Chairman of the Board, who remains as Chairman.

“Jose Hidalgo has done a tremendous job leading the company for the last several years. He has matured our business model, deepened our collaboration with customers and increased the value we deliver to solve tough mission data challenges,” said Shroder. “Our recent series of new contract awards are a testament to FTI’s rapidly evolving technology and expertise, and we look forward to partnering even more closely with our customers under Jose and his team’s leadership now and into the future.”

Hidalgo joined FTI in 2018 as CFO. During his tenure, FTI has developed and enhanced products with AI/ML/predictive capabilities spanning space operations, wargaming, sustainment, risk management, testing, and cyber. Change management initiatives have enhanced organizational agility and collaboration between teams. Since 2023, the company has announced two major technology centers of excellence to drive closer collaboration with the DoD, Intelligence Community, academia, and industry partners. Since June 2024, FTI has been awarded spots on major IDIQ contracts with Space RCO, the U.S. Air Force, and a large DoD cyber initiative.

Hidalgo was previously vice president of accounting and treasury at aerospace and defense contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC).

“I’m very fortunate and honored to lead and work alongside the exceptionally talented, hardworking and innovative team at FTI,” said Hidalgo. “All of us are deeply committed to serving the warfighters who defend our country with modern, focused data solutions they can rely on to succeed in their missions and stay safe.”
