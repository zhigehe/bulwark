The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. Olin reported its financial results for Q4 2024 on January 30, 2025. The Company provided guidance for the first quarter of 2025 that was considerably under analysts’ consensus estimate. The Company claimed that "challenging industry conditions … as commercial customers continue to work down elevated inventories along with softer consumer demand," and also admitted its business was “significantly challenged by subsidized Asian competition."
