The class action concerns whether Novo and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.

On December 20, 2024, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined that the Company's CagriSema product had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. Novo attributed this diminished result, in part, to the previously undisclosed "flexible" nature of the protocol. This "flexibility" resulted in fewer than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with "2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly," the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.

On this news, Novo's American depositary receipt ("ADR") price fell $18.44 per ADR, or 17.83%, to close at $85.00 per ADR on December 20, 2024.
