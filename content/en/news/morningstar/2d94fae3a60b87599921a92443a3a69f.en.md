**Millrose Properties Completes Acquisition of Rausch Coleman Homes Land Assets**

Millrose Properties, Inc. (NYSE: MRP, “Millrose”), a “first-of-its-kind” Homesite Option Purchase Platform for residential homebuilders (HOPP’R), announced today that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of approximately 24,000 homesites from Rausch Coleman Homes (“Rausch Coleman”), and simultaneously executed option agreements with Lennar Corporation (“Lennar”) on all acquired homesites.

Millrose acquired the Rausch Coleman homesites for approximately $900 million in cash, which is net of option deposits funded by Lennar and other holdbacks. The transaction was funded using Millrose’s cash on hand. After the closing, Millrose retains approximately $1.3 billion in available funding capacity under its revolving credit facility.

This transaction follows a previously announced definitive agreement between Lennar and Rausch Coleman, under which Lennar acquired Rausch Coleman’s homebuilding operations.

Darren Richman, CEO and President of Millrose, stated, “Today, we successfully completed the previously announced acquisition of Rausch Coleman homesites, as detailed in the Registration Statement related to Millrose’s spin-off from Lennar. With this milestone achieved, we are now focused on advancing our accretive growth strategy and expanding our counterparties across the industry.”

Millrose is externally managed by Kennedy Lewis Land and Residential Advisors LLC (“Kennedy Lewis”), an affiliate of Kennedy Lewis Investment Management, an institutional alternative investment firm with over $25 billion in assets under management. Kennedy Lewis provides Millrose access to its deep financial expertise, extensive operational platforms and strong homebuilder relationships.

**About Millrose Properties, Inc.**

Millrose purchases and develops residential land and sells finished homesites back to Lennar and potentially other homebuilders by way of option contracts with predetermined costs and takedown schedules. While Lennar is currently Millrose’s only customer, Millrose anticipates that its “first of its kind” public vehicle will be attractive to other homebuilders seeking to implement an asset-light strategy and believes that becoming a capital source for other homebuilders will provide for accretive growth to the Millrose platform.

Millrose’s assets perform more like work-in-process inventory versus traditional land bank assets, with limited entitlement and development risk, and scheduled takedowns that allow homebuilders to purchase finished homesites just in time for home construction. As fully developed homesites are acquired, capital is recycled into future land acquisitions for Lennar and potentially other homebuilders, providing each customer with uninterrupted access to capital. Millrose expects to generate recurring income from monthly option payments pursuant to purchase option contracts with Lennar and potentially other homebuilders.
