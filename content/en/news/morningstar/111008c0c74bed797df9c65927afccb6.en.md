ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla., Feb. 11, 2025


ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla., Feb. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Labor and delivery nurse, laparoscopic surgeon, chaplain, dietitian, clinical research manager, community outreach coordinator, patient liaison. These are just a few of the hundreds of roles team members at AdventHealth hold as they work together to provide whole-person care for their patients and communities. This week, AdventHealth reached a major milestone by welcoming its 100,000th team member to the health system's skilled and compassionate workforce, which cares for nearly 9 million patients annually.

The workforce has grown from 70,000 team members just four short years ago, as the health system has hired 30,000 team members and opened or acquired additional hospitals, free-standing emergency departments and primary care locations to keep up with the growing health needs of its communities. Delivering care across AdventHealth's footprint are five generations of team members, more than half of whom have been with the organization for longer than 10 years.

For AdventHealth team members, the mission of Extending the Healing Ministry of Christ goes far beyond hospital walls and geographic boundaries. For example, in the last year, team members across the system donated to support colleagues affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene, raising more than $500,000 with a company match, and offering unused paid time off to support those who were prevented from working due to storm-related issues. Farther from home, as part of AdventHealth Global Missions, more than 300 team member volunteers took 30 trips to more than nine countries, caring for more than 22,000 underserved people.

All told, team members volunteer tens of thousands of hours each year, participating in such events as free medical clinics, healthy food programs, school supply drives, and by showing up to pitch in with a wide array of community partners, all to make their communities healthier places to live.

"We are not only growing in number but also in the impact we have on delivering whole person care to every person, every time. Each and every one of our 100,000 caring hearts plays a critical role in our mission to extend the healing ministry of Christ," said Olesea Azevedo, senior vice president and chief administrative officer for AdventHealth.

Team members' heart-centered focus echoes in the sentiment shared in a survey leading to one of many employer-of-choice recognitions, AdventHealth's certification in August 2024 as a Great Place to Work®. In that survey, 85% of team members said they feel they are making a difference and 89% shared that they feel good about the ways AdventHealth contributes to the community.

"Becoming a preeminent, faith-based, consumer-focused clinical company would not be possible without our dedicated team members," Azevedo said. "This vision serves to guide not only how we show up in our communities, but also in how we deliver whole-person care to our team."
