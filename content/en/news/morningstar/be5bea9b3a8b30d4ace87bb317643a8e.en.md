About the Lawsuit

Cassava and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On November 25, 2024, the Company disclosed topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on its leading drug candidate, simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study, that indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. On this news, the price of Cassava’s shares fell approximately 83%, from a closing price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024.

The case is *Crocker v. Cassava Sciences, Inc.,* *et al.,* No. 24-cv-1525.
