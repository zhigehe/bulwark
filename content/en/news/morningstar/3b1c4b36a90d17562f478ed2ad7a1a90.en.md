**Comvest Credit Partners Provides Debt Financing to Support Merger of Opexus and Casepoint and Majority Investment from Thoma Bravo**

Comvest Credit Partners, a leading provider of flexible direct financing solutions to middle-market companies, is pleased to announce that it is acting as Administrative Agent on a senior secured credit facility (the “Financing”) to support the merger of Opexus and Casepoint (together, the “Company”), providers of software technology services to the federal government. The Financing also supported the majority investment in the Company from private equity firm Thoma Bravo.

Opexus is a leading provider of process management software for federal government agencies. Casepoint is the industry leader in data discovery technology for litigation, investigations, and data compliance for the federal government and regulated commercial industries. The merger creates a leading provider of data discovery and process management software services for government and regulated enterprises in North America.

“Opexus and Casepoint are high-quality providers of essential data services that have built strong brands in the government technology space,” said Brian Cercek, a Managing Director and Co-Head of Software & Technology Services at Comvest Credit Partners. “This transaction highlights our ability to provide flexible credit financing solutions that support high recurring revenue businesses within the software vertical, an area of continued investment focus.”

“We are pleased to agent our first transaction with Thoma Bravo, a widely recognized software technology investment sponsor, and look forward to further developing our relationship in support of Opexus and Casepoint and other opportunities in the software technology space,” said Kamau Hixon, a Principal at Comvest Credit Partners.

“Comvest Credit Partners worked efficiently on a tight timeline and were easy to partner with. They effectively addressed our financing need as we established an innovative process management and discovery platform,” said Matt Gilbert, a Managing Director at Thoma Bravo.
