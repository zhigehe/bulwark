*GAMCO Asset Management, Top 5 and Long-Term Shareholder, Endorses Matthews’ Director Nominees*

*Urges Shareholders to Vote “FOR” All Three of Matthews’ Director Nominees on the WHITE Proxy Card and “WITHHOLD” on Barington’s Director Nominees*

PITTSBURGH, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Matthews International Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7ALxok-famUF6nKIREaYsZwT5hVEbfRbURY58zqMthgj4xsOIOI3JJ0TQ-K3GF8j2GIqvIMe4WNtgCVXUK9Xs5PA77Jm0DNdgmjUAnqDQiyd5CvnwpX9ZqFILIzuuy1_dhdvYTA6TifNrEszuvhp9l9t9u0YRXvjas4gPgOlmY4LtOTjtloTLjyznnPcB1h_ayhI2PH_fE5tsEQvm2mjA8X3ITUBp9yIwWgGGVmfM2r6Ik6J1xY0-L3HJZFg2gCxbzrga6al_H-8zJUV94hzaVsPV_up6jKY_Te9QQ-LOSQ=) (Nasdaq GSM: MATW) (“Matthews” or the “Company”) today commented on the significant support it has received from its sell-side analysts following its recent fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings announcement.

On February 6, 2025, Matthews announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025, highlighting that Memorialization and SGK Brand Solutions continued their solid performance, and that the Industrial Technologies segment was challenged by the impact of the Tesla litigation. Importantly, last week Matthews announced that an arbitrator affirmed that the Company has the right to sell its Dry Battery Electrode (“DBE”) solutions to customers other than Tesla, and, as a result, Matthews intends to immediately resume marketing, selling and delivering its DBE products to other customers in the growing electric vehicle market.

On the earnings call, Matthews also highlighted the benefits of the SGK transaction and other actions the Board has taken to unlock the value of our businesses. Following the earnings announcement, the Company’s sell-side analysts noted the positive momentum underway:

* “Revenue and EBITDA results reflected customer delays related to the Tesla lawsuit. MATW announced that an arbitrator issued a ruling in favor of Matthews in its case against Tesla. The ruling supported Matthews’ pre-Tesla history in manufacturing advanced DBE technology and affirmed that MATW has the right to sell its solutions to customers other than Tesla. Matthews will immediately resume marketing efforts to rebuild its order pipeline, and we expect the segment to see renewed sales growth as backlog builds.” – B. Riley
* “On a sum of the parts basis, we believe a higher valuation could be justified. As described in the chart below, applying a 9x EBITDA multiple to our pro forma FY26 estimates for Memorialization, 8x for SGK and SGS, 10x for the higher growth Industrial business and 7x for corporate expense equates to a fair value in the $45 range. Looking out 1-2 years further, and utilizing those same multiples, fair value could approach $50/share.” – CJS Securities
* “Although it is still in an early stage of market development, the economic benefits of the DBE platform compared to the traditional wet process are compelling, in our view. The DBE process reduces energy and labor costs by 75% and requires 70% less capital investment. With significantly lower capital costs, the price of the DBE system becomes less of an issue with potential customers. One major customer is commercially developing the DBE process, but both battery producers and automotive OEMs are recognizing the benefits of DBE systems.” – B. Riley
* “Our price target of $42 equates to 9x our back of the envelope estimate of EBITDA post the SGS transaction, offering nearly ~60% upside potential. Our positive opinion reflects; 1) meaningfully reduced financial leverage and increased flexibility, post-traction, 2) the improved trajectory of the Brand Solutions business under the JV, including $50mm (or more) potential cost synergies over the next few years, 3) the potential for accelerated debt refinancing given the reduction in leverage, and 4) the potential for further monetization events going forward.” – CJS Securities
* “As Industrial Technologies recovers and SGK is divested, we believe management is in a good position to maximize the growth opportunities of the business to enhance shareholder value. Shares trade just above what the Memorialization and SGK businesses are worth, net of overhead expenses, with little value assigned to Industrial Technology.” – B. Riley
* “Post-covid mortality rates have normalized, and the company continues to see multiple growth opportunities despite the likely return of Memorialization sales growth to historic levels. The segment saw significantly higher covid-related casket sales and EBITDA margins, but as casket sales growth moderates, we believe other areas of the business are poised for growth. The company will not only see the revenue benefits from the improvement of their traditional end markets but should also see incremental revenue contribution from new applications such as battery storage.” – B. Riley

Furthermore, a recent Bank of America analysis on global EV batteries underscores the significant value embedded in our DBE business. The analysis stated that: “We view price-competitiveness of EV battery (40% of EV cost) as key success factor in the next 3 years, given rising EV OEMs' needs for volume/entry from premium models as the EV market segmentation evolves.”1

This analysis reinforces the significant market opportunity Matthews maintains in the DBE space given its strategic investment in its highly proprietary solutions arising from its core calendaring technology. We continue to expect the recent Tesla ruling to expand the reach of our innovative DBE offerings and have a positive impact on our performance moving forward.

**As a reminder, a Top 5 and long-term shareholder, GAMCO Asset Management, recently announced that it will support Matthews’ director nominees. In its press release, GAMCO stated: “After a thorough review, GAMCO believes that Matthews’ proposed slate of nominees is best positioned, at this time, to focus and execute on the Company’s efforts to surface underlying value for all shareholders.”**

**This is a clear message from a top shareholder that Matthews is taking the right actions and has the right team and Board in place to continue the execution of the current strategy.** 

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor to Matthews. Sidley Austin LLP is serving as legal counsel to Matthews.
