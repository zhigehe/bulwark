See the reconciliation of non-GAAP items in the attached financial schedules.

"I am pleased we delivered 15% growth in Adjusted EPS for the full year -- at the top end of our range, driven by strong performance in all three segments. As we entered 2024, we told shareholders that we expected our Adjusted EPS to grow between 10% and 15%, and we would be driving to go through the range. Throughout the year our results increasingly demonstrated that it was likely we would perform at the upper end of that range. Now with these very good fourth quarter results, you can see we performed at the top of the range and even ahead of our historical 10- and 20-year CAGR rates. I would like to also point out that our 2024 adjusted EPS of $8.61 was adversely impacted by significant increases in interest and tax expense, but also benefited from share repurchases. With interest, taxes and share repurchases netting each other, you can see that the 15% increase in adjusted EPS was driven by the 16% increase in operating income made possible by strong revenue growth, scale and cost management. For the fourth quarter we delivered record adjusted EPS of $2.08, a 10% year-over-year increase as well as double-digit growth in operating income and adjusted EBITDA," stated Michael J. Brown, Euronet's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "EFT delivered double-digit growth across all metrics driven by international travel, growth in merchant acquiring business, fee increase opportunities, and expansion into new markets. Money Transfer produced strong fourth quarter results across all metrics including a 33% growth in digital transactions. In epay, our core business delivered strong results from continued digital branded payments and mobile growth.”

Adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA were adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments in the EFT Segment during the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023 and the full year of 2024 and a non-cash gain in the full year 2023.

Taking into consideration recent trends in the business and the global economy, the Company anticipates its 2025 adjusted EPS will grow 12% to 16% year-over-year, consistent with its 10 and 20 year compounded annualized growth rates. This outlook does not include any changes that may develop in foreign exchange rates, interest rates or other unforeseen factors.

**Segment and Other Results**

**The EFT Processing Segment** reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2024 compared with the same period or date in 2023:

* Revenues of $265.6 million, a 12% increase from $237.9 million (13% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $37.3 million, a 46% increase from $25.5 million (48% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted operating income of $37.3 million, a 33% increase from $28.0 million (35% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $61.7 million, an 18% increase from $52.2 million (19% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Transactions of 3,203 million, a 35% increase from 2,369 million.
* Total of 55,248 installed ATMs as of December 31, 2024, a 5% increase from 52,652 at December 31, 2023. Operated 49,945 active ATMs as of December 31, 2024, a 6% increase from 47,303 as of December 31, 2023.

**The EFT Processing Segment** reports the following results for the full year 2024 compared with the same period in 2023:

* Revenues of $1,161.2 million, a 10% increase from $1,058.3 million (10% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $256.0 million, a 24% increase from $206.3 million (25% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted operating income of $255.6 million, a 24% increase from $205.8 million (25% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $353.5 million, an 18% increase from $300.4 million (19% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Transactions of 11,424 million, a 35% increase from 8,473 million.

Revenue, operating income, and adjusted EBITDA growth for both the fourth quarter and full year 2024 was driven by continued growth in transactions in nearly all markets, new market expansion, fee increase opportunities, cost management and growth in the merchant acquiring business with adjusted EBITDA doubling in the last two years.

The EFT Segment's total installed ATMs at December 31, 2024 grew 5% over December 31, 2023 ATMs due to the net addition of 1,729 Euronet-owned ATMs, 773 new outsourcing ATMs and the addition of 94 low-margin ATMs in India. The difference between installed and active ATMs relates to ATMs that have been seasonally deactivated.

**The epay Segment** reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2024 compared with the same period or date in 2023:

* Revenues of $342.2 million, an 8% increase from $316.7 million (10% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $48.0 million, a 10% increase from $43.6 million (12% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $49.9 million, a 10% increase from $45.4 million (12% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Transactions of 1,185 million, a 31% increase from 906 million.
* POS terminals of approximately 777,000 as of December 31, 2024, a 5% decrease from approximately 821,000.
* Retailer locations of approximately 362,000 as of December 31, 2024, a 3% increase from approximately 352,000.

**The epay Segment** reports the following results for the full year 2024 compared with the same period in 2023:

* Revenues of $1,150.5 million, a 6% increase from $1,082.4 million (7% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $129.9 million, a 3% increase from $126.2 million (4% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $137.2 million, a 3% increase from $133.1 million (4% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Transactions of 4,374 million, a 15% increase from 3,789 million.

Fourth quarter and full year 2024 constant currency revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by continued expansion of digital branded payment and mobile sales.

**The Money Transfer Segment** reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2024 compared with the same period or date in 2023:

* Revenues of $441.9 million, a 9% increase from $405.1 million (9% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $58.4 million, a 13% increase from $51.9 million (12% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $64.4 million, a 9% increase from $59.3 million (9% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Total transactions of 46.9 million, an 11% increase from 42.4 million.
* Network locations of approximately 607,000 as of December 31, 2024, a 5% increase from approximately 580,000.

**The Money Transfer Segment**reports the following results for the full year 2024 compared with the same period in 2023:

* Revenues of $1,686.5 million, an 8% increase from $1,555.2 million (9% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Operating income of $201.0 million, an 8% increase from $185.4 million (9% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Adjusted EBITDA of $227.0 million, a 5% increase from $216.4 million (5% increase on a constant currency basis).
* Total transactions of 176.9 million, a 9% increase from 161.7 million.

Fourth quarter constant currency revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was the result of 14% growth in U.S.-outbound transactions, 11% growth in international-originated money transfers and 8% growth in xe transactions, partially offset by a 14% decline in the intra-U.S. business. These transaction growth rates include 33% growth in direct-to-consumer digital transactions.

Full year 2024 constant currency revenue, operating income, and adjusted EBITDA growth was the result of 12% growth in U.S.-outbound transactions, 11% growth in international-originated money transfers and 16% growth in xe transactions, partially offset by a 14% decline in the intra-U.S. business. These transaction growth rates include 28% growth in direct-to-consumer digital transactions.

**Corporate and Other** reports $21.0 million of expense for the fourth quarter 2024 compared with $23.6 million for the fourth quarter 2023. For the full year 2024, Corporate and Other reports $83.7 million of expense compared with $85.3 million for the full year 2023. The decrease in corporate expenses for both the fourth quarter and full year 2024 is largely the result of a decrease in long-term compensation expenses based on lower share value.

**Balance Sheet and Financial Position**  
Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand were $1,278.8 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $1,524.1 million as of September 30, 2024. The net decrease in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents during the quarter is mainly due to working capital fluctuations, repayment of short-term borrowings, $50 million in share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Total indebtedness was $1,949.8 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $2,278.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in debt was largely due to repayment of short-term borrowings. Availability under the Company's revolving credit facility was approximately $1,335 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase in availability of the revolving credit facility was primarily the result of an increase and extension of our credit facility in December 2024 from $1.25 billion to $1.90 billion.

**Non-GAAP Measures**  
In addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency financial measures, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share. These measures should be used in addition to, and not a substitute for, revenues, net income and earnings per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. These non-GAAP measures are also an integral part of the Company's internal reporting and performance assessment for executives and senior management. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

The Company does not provide a reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for GAAP and the related GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation, including adjustments that would be necessary for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other charges reflected in the Company's reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.

(1) Constant currency financial measures are computed as if foreign currency exchange rates did not change from the prior period. This information is provided to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company's results when compared to the prior period.

(2) Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding, to the extent incurred in the period, non-cash gains and non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted operating income represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding, to the extent incurred in the period, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, non-cash gains, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and other non-operating or non-recurring items that are considered expenses or income under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.

(4) Adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted U.S. GAAP earnings per share excluding, to the extent incurred in the period, the tax-effected impacts of: a) foreign currency exchange gains or losses, b) share-based compensation, c) acquired intangible asset amortization, d) non-cash income tax expense, e) non-cash gains and non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, f) other non-operating or non-recurring items and g) dilutive shares relate to the Company's convertible bonds. Adjusted earnings per share represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.
