“Since our founding nearly 100 years ago, we have been deeply rooted in the communities we serve, working across our family of companies to support our neighbors," said Blackie Wills, President and CEO of Wills Group. “This year's report highlights what happens when we work together with nonprofit leaders and the communities they serve to deploy resources that can create new pathways for impact. We are excited about our collaborative approach to creating meaningful, lasting change."

Across the Mid-Atlantic region, Dash In and Splash In operate over 55 locations, playing a vital role in addressing local challenges. The 2024 impact report, released today, showcases how Wills Group and its retail brands collaborate with nonprofit and community partners, combining flexible resources with local expertise. In service of strengthening connections with local nonprofit partners, Wills Group convened its first community engagement roundtable in 2024 at its headquarters in La Plata, Maryland. The gathering united key Mid-Atlantic community leaders, including representatives from LifeStyles of Maryland, Maryland Food Bank, Melwood, Oasis Fresh Foods Market, and Warp & Weft.

“Wills Group and its companies have been instrumental collaborators, helping to connect us to resources and organizations where there are intersections in our work and missions,” said Scott Gibson, Chief Operating Officer at Melwood. “For instance, we were recently presented with an opportunity to launch a social enterprise in the foodservice area. It's something Melwood has never done before, and I was able to call on Wills Group and their expertise to help us strategize an approach. They've become true partners in our thinking.”

Additional highlights from the 2024 Community Engagement Report include:

* 370 employee volunteer hours
* 49 nonprofit organizations supported
* $900,000 donated to food banks and local pantries
* $44,000+ invested in local parks and outdoor projects
* $65,000 allocated to water conservation projects
* $427,000 raised at the [annual Blackie Wills Golf Classic](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwillsgroup.com%2Feighth-annual-blackie-wills-golf-classic%2F&esheet=54199621&newsitemid=20250211516602&lan=en-US&anchor=annual+Blackie+Wills+Golf+Classic&index=2&md5=25acb93758db4edf33b4fe8e72ccba76)
