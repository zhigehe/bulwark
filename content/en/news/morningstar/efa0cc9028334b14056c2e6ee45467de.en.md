[PROS Holdings, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pros.com%2F&esheet=54205439&newsitemid=20250212304344&lan=en-US&anchor=PROS+Holdings%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=1c9c58acfd1eedadd633e7c75c7f0363) (NYSE: PRO), a leading provider of AI-powered SaaS pricing and selling solutions, today announced it was named to the Constellation ShortList for both Price Optimization solutions and Configure, Price, Quote solutions. This marks the eighth consecutive year of validation for PROS and its ability to deliver transformative AI-driven commerce solutions that help accelerate sales and fuel profitable growth.

“Today’s B2B buyers expect seamless, dynamic, and highly personalized purchasing experiences across any channel, making traditional pricing and selling approaches increasingly ineffective,” said Nadine Pyter, Vice President of Product and Solution Marketing, PROS. “PROS solutions, with AI at the core, optimize pricing in real-time and equip sales teams with data-driven insights and prescriptive recommendations to deliver precise, optimized offers instantly. By transforming pricing and selling into a strategic advantage, PROS empowers businesses to drive revenue growth, improve margins, and exceed customer expectations in an increasingly digital and competitive landscape."

Both solutions named to the Constellation ShortLists are part of the PROS Platform, a unified AI-powered SaaS platform that sits at the center of every customer offer – the intersection of product, price and place – enabling businesses to define, implement and optimize their omnichannel selling efforts:
