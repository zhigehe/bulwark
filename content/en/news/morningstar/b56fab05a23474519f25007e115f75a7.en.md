**New Research From The Nonprofit Alliance Shows Strong Public Support for Nonprofits as Sector Faces Federal Funding Threats**

*A survey of 2,500 U.S. adults demonstrates support across political party affiliations.*

As the nonprofit sector confronts the White House’s latest sweeping threat to federal funding, new research from [The Nonprofit Alliance](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftnpa.org%2F&esheet=54202045&newsitemid=20250207338715&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Nonprofit+Alliance&index=1&md5=b14b9780e7a1bc871907b2e0672bf02a) reveals strong public support for nonprofit organizations and their essential role in American society.

A February 7 executive action directs federal agencies to review all funding provided to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), claiming “many … are engaged in actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people." This comes despite three temporary restraining orders from federal courts mandating the reversal of recent funding freezes.

"Labeling NGOs as undermining national interests while tying funding decisions to undefined and shifting political priorities jeopardizes essential services and vulnerable communities that rely on them," said Shannon McCracken, chief executive officer of The Nonprofit Alliance. "Our research clearly shows that Americans across the political spectrum recognize the vital role nonprofits play in our society and support federal funding for these critical services."

The research, titled "Protecting Vital Service: Mobilizing Support for Nonprofit Federal Funding," is based on a November 2024 survey of 2,500 U.S. adults. While some political differences exist, there is a strong endorsement for continued federal funding when nonprofits are seen as a vital force in addressing issues such as healthcare, education, and emergency relief.

* Republicans (83%) and Democrats (88%) agree that nonprofits are essential to the nation's well-being.
* Fifty-eight percent of Americans believe that the federal government should provide ongoing funding for charitable organizations to cover their core operational and administrative expenses. Broken out by self-identified party affiliation, “yes” was the response from 68.5% of Democrats, 51.7% of Republicans, 67.6% of Green party members, and 56.8% of Libertarians.
* Individuals who believe that crises such as climate disasters or economic downturns intensify the need for nonprofit services are roughly three times more likely to favor government support.

"The nonprofit sector has long been a trusted partner in advancing American values, supporting security, and fostering global stability,” said McCracken. “We urge the administration to focus on strengthening the vital partnerships between government and NGOs that serve the best interests of the nation and the world.”
