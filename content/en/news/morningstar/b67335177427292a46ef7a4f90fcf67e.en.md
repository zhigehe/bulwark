"MagO7 remains a favorite because it delivers gentle, reliable results," says Pratte. "Taking it before bed can bring users relief come morning, alleviating the discomfort of constipation and bloating for millions of Americans. This gentle detoxification is essential for a healthy gut, making it a key step in our transformative Gut Health Journey™."

**MagO7 Utilizes Proprietary Oxygenated Magnesium Oxide Compounds to Get Results**What sets MagO7 apart is its proprietary formula that utilizes oxygenated magnesium oxide compounds. When ingested, magnesium oxide reacts in the acidic environment of the stomach, increasing osmotic pressure within the digestive tract. This process enhances stool excretion, promotes water transfer to the intestines, and ultimately stimulates the intestinal walls to expel waste gently and effectively.
