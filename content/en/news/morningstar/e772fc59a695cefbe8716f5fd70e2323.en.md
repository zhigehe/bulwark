Theraclion: Publication of Adjusted Accounts for the First Half of 2024

Regulatory News:

**THERACLION (ISIN: FR0010120402; Mnemo: ALTHE), an innovative company developing a robotic platform for non-invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for the treatment of varicose veins,** reports on its 2024 activities.

Theraclion announced in its press release of January 6, 2025, the continuation of the strategic refocusing on the varicose veins market and confirmed its decision to no longer market its Echopulse machines intended to treat the thyroid in the near future. The company indicated on this occasion that it was taking back the old generation of Echopulse machines initially intended for the Chinese market, an operation resulting in the issuance by Theraclion of a credit note to the China joint venture of €680,000, to limit the latter's loss. The company has adjusted the half-year accounts to reflect the impact of this described operation and is publishing its adjusted results for the first half of 2024.

**Cash flow and going concern**

As of December 31, 2024, Theraclion had a cash balance of €4.1 million, down from €5.9 million at end June 2024. This cash position will cover Theraclion's needs until the middle of the second quarter of 2025.

The Company has already taken steps to secure the financing it needs to pursue its strategy and begin its commercial expansion. Should the Company be unable to obtain such funding, its long-term viability could be at risk.

**About Theraclion**

Theraclion is a French MedTech company committed to developing a non-invasive alternative to surgery through the innovative use of focused ultrasound.

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) does not require incisions or an operating room, leaves no scars, and enables patients to return to their daily activities immediately. The HIFU treatment method concentrates therapeutic ultrasounds on an internal focal point from outside the body.

Theraclion develops the HIFU, CE-marked, platform for varicose veins treatment SONOVEIN®, which has the potential to replace millions of surgical procedures every year. In the United States, SONOVEIN® is an investigational device limited to investigational use; it is not available for sale in the U.S.

Based in Malakoff (Paris), the Theraclion team is made up of some 30 people, most of them involved in technological and clinical development.
