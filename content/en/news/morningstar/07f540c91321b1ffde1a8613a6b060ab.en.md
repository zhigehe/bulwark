The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Elastic significantly changed its sales operations, specifically for its Americas customer segment. The Company's changes were likely to disrupt its sales operations for the first quarter of FY 2025. The Company overstated the stability of its sales operations. The Company was likely to miss its revenue guidance for FY 2025 due to its changes. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Elastic, investors suffered damages.

[Join the case](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362002-1&h=3929437852&u=https%3A%2F%2Fschallfirm.com%2Fcases%2Felastic-n-v-2%2F%23case-form&a=Join+the+case) to recover your losses.
