**San Antonio Jury Renders $109 Million Verdict Against CPS Energy for 2021 Home Explosion**

*Blast resulting from natural gas leak leaves mother and son with catastrophic injuries*

A San Antonio jury has delivered a $109 million verdict against CPS Energy for failing to properly maintain its gas system, leading to a natural gas explosion and fire that left two residents with permanent and life-altering injuries.

[***Video of the attorneys discussing the verdict***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fscl%2Ffo%2Fnbfv6kho1b9a5kznuh6ep%2FADDNpk7Lm_9z-Oue8Xt8SQk%3Frlkey%3Df93ccly6kp9w5ji23xakphixt%26st%3Dmnljt8b9%26dl%3D0&esheet=54203666&newsitemid=20250210606476&lan=en-US&anchor=Video+of+the+attorneys+discussing+the+verdict&index=1&md5=3486abc255159c94b8fc955d4c423d7f)

Robert Rymers suffered extensive burns to his body when his rental property located in the Colosseum Heights area of southeast San Antonio exploded just before 11 p.m. on May 1, 2021. Mr. Rymers’ mother sustained burn injuries in addition to an air embolism from the blast.

Although they survived the blast, Mr. Rymers was left permanently disabled and his mother, Virginia, continues to contend with physical and significant mental injuries. The Rymers lost everything in the explosion and ensuing fire, including two family dogs which were killed in the blast.

“CPS Energy refused to take responsibility despite the fact that both the San Antonio Police Department’s arson team and the San Antonio Fire Department determined the explosion was caused by natural gas,” said the Rymers’ attorney [Michael Lyons](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyons-simmons.com%2Fattorneys%2Fmichael-p-lyons%2F&esheet=54203666&newsitemid=20250210606476&lan=en-US&anchor=Michael+Lyons&index=2&md5=e67de537af7c2b6c97142d3c776fad01) of the Dallas-based trial firm of [Lyons & Simmons](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyons-simmons.com%2F&esheet=54203666&newsitemid=20250210606476&lan=en-US&anchor=Lyons+%26amp%3B+Simmons&index=3&md5=ab290936e0c106ff150848c03f0abfe8).

“From the moment first responders arrived on the scene, the fuel source was believed to be natural gas, but the investigation ultimately confirmed it,” [Chris Simmons](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyons-simmons.com%2Fattorneys%2Fchristopher-j-simmons%2F&esheet=54203666&newsitemid=20250210606476&lan=en-US&anchor=Chris+Simmons&index=4&md5=d18a42d47fd745e6b76680c4a6cc8979) said. “The verdict cannot undo this tragedy, but it serves as an example that our jury system remains the best way for citizens to receive justice.”

According to Lyons, the home’s gas system, originally installed in 1960, had a history of failures leading to the meter being replaced in 2008 and 2015. In 2020, the property owner made the decision to convert the home to all-electric.

The case is *Robert Rymers and Virginia Rymers v. CPS Energy*, No. 2021CI18484 in the 166th District Court in Bexar County. The Rymers were represented at trial by Michael Lyons, Chris Simmons, Chris Carr and Michael Wozniak of Lyons & Simmons, LLP, along with Omar G. Alvarez of the Law Office of O.G. Alvarez & Associates P.C. in San Antonio.
