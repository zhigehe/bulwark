NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- B&H is to announce Nikon is making good on their renewed dedication to video with the release of their latest lens, the [Nikkor Z 28-135mm f/4 PZ lens](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=2399563228&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859492-REG%2Fnikon_nikkor_z_28_135mm_f_4.html&a=Nikkor+Z+28-135mm+f%2F4+PZ+lens). It's the first Power Zoom lens the company has made for their FX, full-frame format, and one they've designed to pair with their flagship [Z9 mirrorless camera](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=3721892737&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629829-REG%2Fnikon_z_9_mirrorless_digital.html&a=Z9+mirrorless+camera), [Z8](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=108784970&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1765622-REG%2Fnikon_z8_mirrorless_camera.html&a=Z8) and Z6 III cameras. An all-in-one lens aimed at the professional market, the lens's broad focal range, internal focusing mechanism, and short minimum focusing distance make it an ideal choice for documentaries and location work by a solo videographer or small crew.

* Programmable Control Ring & L-Fn Buttons
* Meso Amorphous Coating
* Internal Zoom Mechanism

Power Zoom lenses are particularly useful for video production, allowing digital control over aperture adjustments, and more importantly, smooth, remote, and uniform control over the zoom function. The [Nikon Z 28-135mm f/4](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=1690236656&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859492-REG%2Fnikon_nikkor_z_28_135mm_f_4.html&a=Nikon+Z+28-135mm+f%2F4) PZ uses stepping motor (STM) to change between focal lengths, suppressing focus breathing and offering 11 different zoom speeds that can be assigned to the lens's zoom lever or one of its two L-Fn buttons.

The zoom ring angle and direction of rotation can be customized. Additionally, users can control zoom remotely with a computer, smartphone, or tablet using the NX Tether software or the SnapBridge or NX Field apps.

The convenient 28-135mm focal range benefits a variety of compositions, all of which can be accomplished without changing the lens. The lens also supports close-up work with a minimum focus distance of 13.4" in the 28-50mm range and 22.4" in the telephoto range.

When used with the [Nikon Z9](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=2259844352&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629829-REG%2Fnikon_z_9_mirrorless_digital.html&a=Nikon+Z9), [Z8](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=108784970&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1765622-REG%2Fnikon_z8_mirrorless_camera.html&a=Z8) and [Z6 III camera](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361598-1&h=2283046062&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1834803-REG%2Fnikon_z6_iii_mirrorless_camera.html&a=Z6+III+camera) the Hi-Res Zoom feature enables 4K video recording with a 270mm equivalent angle of view at the telephoto end. A dedicated Synchro mode allows for simultaneous optical zoom and Hi-Res Zoom using a single control when recording.

The internal zoom mechanism results in a 2.66 lb balanced lens suitable for use with gimbals. Other professional accessories, including matte boxes and follow-focus assemblies, are also supported for use with the lens. The lens comes with a rectangular lens hood that helps users control the light entering the lens and includes a filter adjustment window allows for making changes without detaching the hood.

Built to approximate the height of the Z9, the lens features Nikon's best anti-reflection coating, the Meso Amorphous coat, to significantly reduce ghosting and flare. An additional fluorine coat repels dust, water, and debris, adding to the lens's dust and drip-resistant construction.

In addition to the two assignable L-Fn buttons and zoom lever, the lens also features a distinctive yellow video ring around the mount and new Cinema Lens style text.
