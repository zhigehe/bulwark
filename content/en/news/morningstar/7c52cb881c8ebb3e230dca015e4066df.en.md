**Ramp and Apex Unveil Innovative Digital Investing Solution to Help Maximize Cash Returns for Businesses**

Apex Fintech Solutions Inc. (“Apex”), an innovation launchpad for the global investment ecosystem, is excited to collaborate with leading financial operations platform, Ramp, on a new solution that helps businesses earn more on their operating cash. The solution, which is called the Ramp Investment Account, is part of Ramp’s new [Treasury](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Framp.com%2Ftreasury&esheet=54201937&newsitemid=20250210157437&lan=en-US&anchor=Treasury&index=1&md5=7a46a56c0919f463e82fc80d8b54edb5) offering and is designed to give businesses a simple way to invest their extra cash in high-yield money market funds.

Ramp’s extensive platform already helps businesses manage their spending across corporate cards, expenses, bill payments, travel, procurement, and more. Now, by working with Apex as their brokerage firm, Ramp allows businesses to invest excess cash in a yield-forward Apex investment account from directly within the Ramp platform.

To start, customers will be able to invest in the Invesco Premier U.S. Government Money portfolio, a fund that invests in short-term, high-credit-quality money market instruments. The service is designed for simplification of use, so businesses can move their extra cash into an investment account with just a few clicks.

"We're excited to work with Apex to give our customers more ways to manage their money," said Colin Kennedy, Chief Business Officer of Ramp. "This new investment option helps businesses put their cash to work."

Apex handles the investment operations through its suite of APIs, while Ramp makes Apex’s services available through its platform currently servicing 30,000+ U.S. businesses. This means companies can view their investment account alongside the other day-to-day tasks they handle within the Ramp platform, from bill payments to expense tracking. As a regulated broker-dealer, Apex provides robust investing solutions, complementing Ramp's mission to help businesses achieve more with every dollar and hour.

“We’re thrilled to collaborate with Ramp to bring an innovative investment solution to businesses,” said Connor Coughlin, Chief Commercial Officer at Apex Fintech Solutions. “At Apex, our mission is to empower our partners with seamless, technology-driven solutions that make a real impact. By integrating Apex's clearing and brokerage capabilities into Ramp’s platform, we’re enabling businesses to effortlessly optimize their cash management strategies while focusing on their core operations.”
