CLEVELAND, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Avient Corporation (NYSE: AVNT), an innovator of materials solutions, today announced its fourth quarter and full year results for 2024. Fourth quarter and full year GAAP earnings per share (EPS) were $0.52 and $1.84, compared to $0.30 and $0.83 in the prior year, respectively.

The company noted that full year 2024 GAAP EPS includes special items of $0.17 (see attachment 3) and $0.65 of intangible amortization expense (see attachment 1). Full year 2024 adjusted EPS was $2.66 compared to $2.36 in the prior year.

"Our teams remained focused and delivered 5% organic sales growth in the quarter with a backdrop of U.S. elections, inflation fears, and a changing geopolitical climate," said Dr. Ashish Khandpur, President and Chief Executive Officer, Avient Corporation. "Organic sales grew in all geographic regions with the U.S. and Canada growing at 6%, EMEA at 1%, Asia at 7% and Latin America at 14%."

Commenting on full year 2024 results, Dr. Khandpur said, "I'm also very pleased to finish with full year adjusted EPS of $2.66, reflecting a 13% increase over the prior year. We grew organic sales in each of the regions with both our Color, Additives and Inks and Specialty Engineered Materials segments growing at 3% and 6%, respectively, while expanding adjusted EBITDA margins 90 and 110 basis points, respectively, over 2023."

"Our goal was to generate organic sales growth with margin expansion, and we delivered both in 2024," said Dr. Khandpur. "By continuing to focus on our customers, our team achieved these results against a choppy macro environment."

Dr. Khandpur added, "In addition, our 2024 safety performance represented the safest year in company history and evidenced that we'll continue to build upon the many proven foundational strengths of Avient as we execute our new strategy."

**2025 Outlook**

"As we shared at our Investor Day in December, we laid out a path to grow organic sales 100 – 200 basis points above GDP with margin expansion by intersecting high growth markets and secular trends with our technologies to create platforms that scale," said Jamie Beggs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Avient Corporation. "As we begin 2025, we are poised to execute our strategy to deliver value for our shareholders by prioritizing our portfolio, amplifying innovation, leveraging digital technologies and harnessing the collective strengths of our more than 9,000 global employees."

"Looking ahead, we are projecting first quarter adjusted EPS to be $0.76, which is in-line with the prior year quarter and includes a $0.04 foreign exchange headwind due to the stronger U.S. dollar," added Ms. Beggs. "This translates to 6% adjusted EPS growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and an encouraging start to the year, especially considering the outsized timing of defense orders that benefited the first quarter last year."

"The current macro environment presents several uncertainties related to policy, inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates which provides for a broader set of potential outcomes for the year," Ms. Beggs said. "Our best full year forecast using present information is an adjusted EBITDA range of $540 to $570 million and adjusted EPS range of $2.70 to $2.94. The mid-point of the adjusted EPS range of $2.82 represents 11% growth, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $0.12 for the full year."

Dr. Khandpur added, "Despite the near-term uncertainties in the macro environment, we remain focused on what we can control: staying close to our customers and executing our strategy. Building off our strong performance in 2024, I remain optimistic in our team's ability to achieve the long-term financial targets we shared at Investor Day last December."

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

The Company uses both GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures include organic performance (which excludes the impact of foreign exchange), adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. Avient's chief operating decision maker uses these financial measures to monitor and evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company and each business segment and to allocate resources.

The Company does not provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, to the most comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items, and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items, such as, but not limited to, environmental remediation costs and associated recoveries, mark-to-market adjustments on pension and other post-retirement obligations, acquisition-related charges, and other non-routine costs. Each of such adjustments has not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

| Senior management uses comparisons of adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Avient shareholders and diluted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Avient shareholders, excluding special items, to assess performance and facilitate comparability of results. Further, as a result of Avient's strategic shift to an innovator of materials solutions, it has completed several acquisitions and divestitures which have resulted in a significant amount of intangible asset amortization. Management excludes intangible asset amortization from adjusted EPS as it believes excluding acquired intangible asset amortization is a useful measure of current period earnings per share. Senior management believes these measures are useful to investors because they allow for comparison to Avient's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure Avient's operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on timing, frequency and magnitude. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or solely as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See *Attachment 3* for a definition and summary of special items. |

| **Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)** |
| (In millions, except per share data) |
|  |
| Senior management uses operating income before special items to assess performance and allocate resources because senior management believes that this measure is most useful in understanding current profitability levels and how it may serve as a basis for future performance. In addition, operating income before the effect of special items is a component of Avient's annual incentive plans and is used in debt covenant computations. Senior management believes this measure is useful to investors because it allows for comparison to Avient's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure Avient's operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on timing, frequency and magnitude. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or solely as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See *Attachment 3* for a definition and summary of special items. |
