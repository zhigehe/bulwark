For more than two decades, AARP's Movies for Grownups has recognized the talent and experience of older actors and filmmakers. AARP continues to champion movies for grownups, by grownups, by advocating for the 50-plus audience, and encouraging films and TV shows that resonate with older viewers.

"People are living longer, healthier and more vibrant lives than ever before, and AARP created Movies for Grownups to celebrate entertainment that better reflects this reality," said AARP CEO Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan. "These movies and TV shows reflect and connect with older adults, and help audiences of all ages have a better appreciation of living throughout all their years."

Today's event, which was hosted by Alan Cumming, the Tony and Emmy Award-winning host of the widely lauded competition show *The Traitors*, will be broadcast nationwide by ***Great Performances*** on Sunday, February 23, 2025, at 7/6c on PBS (check local listings). Critically acclaimed stage and screen actress Glenn Close received the Career Achievement Award, the event's top honor.

The event's highlights included Demi Moore, awarded Best Actress for her role in *The Substance*, who remarked on the surprising joy she feels about getting older, saying, "I hope that this film and this moment serves as a reminder that we don't fade. We evolve, and there is no expiration date for talent, passion, curiosity, and purpose." Another memorable moment from the evening was when Chief Royal Ramey, a former inmate-turned-CEO of the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program, presented the award for Best Ensemble to *Sing Sing*, which was accepted by Colman Domingo and former inmate, Clarence Maclin, who thanked AARP for the honor.

Best Actor honoree Adrien Brody provided an emotional speech about his upbringing, saying, "When I was a boy, an only child in Queens – surrounded by a lot of harshness and things I couldn't understand, or defend myself or others in this world against – I prayed to God to be a grownup, so I would somehow be empowered to have a voice. I realize that prayer has been answered through my work."
