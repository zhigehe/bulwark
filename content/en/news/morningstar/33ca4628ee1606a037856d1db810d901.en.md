NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against AstraZeneca PLC (“AstraZeneca” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AZN) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired AstraZeneca common stock between February 23, 2022 and December 17, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

On December 23, 2024, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca’s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

When investors learned the truth, AstraZeneca’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.
