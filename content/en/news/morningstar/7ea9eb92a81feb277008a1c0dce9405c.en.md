**MedsEngine** **Selected as Finalist in Payor Category of the Emerge Innovation Contest at HIMSS25**

[MedsEngine](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medsengine.com%2F&esheet=54203122&newsitemid=20250211467488&lan=en-US&anchor=MedsEngine&index=1&md5=b6eb9fa52b3dc035cfaa5cc94c69b715), a clinical decision support software designed to optimize treatment for hypertension, cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure, is proud to announce they were selected as a finalist in the payor category of the Emerge Innovation Experience Contest at HIMSS25.

Dr. Doug Romer, MedsEngine CMO, stated, “given the level of competition, having MedsEngine recognized among innovative solutions that are transforming healthcare delivery is truly an honor and recognition of the value that MedsEngine provides in improving patient outcomes and reducing the overall cost of care.”

Users of the MedsEngine hypertension module have reported outstanding results, with more than 90% of their patients achieving a blood pressure of <140/90 in less than two visits for ten consecutive years. Romer added, “these results are industry leading and show the benefits of utilizing technology. Guideline recommendations work if they are used, unfortunately, complexity and time limitations often limit their use. MedsEngine empowers providers to apply guideline treatment recommendations for hypertension, cholesterol and type 2 diabetes in seconds.”

MedsEngine will be exhibiting its innovative platform at HIMSS25. Visit booth 2567 to see a live demonstration and learn how MedsEngine is transforming chronic disease control.
