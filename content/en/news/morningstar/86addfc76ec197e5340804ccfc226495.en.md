**KBRA Assigns Preliminary Ratings to PMT Loan Trust 2025-INV2 (PMTLT 2025-INV2)**

KBRA assigns preliminary ratings to 62 classes of mortgage backed notes from PMT Loan Trust 2025-INV2 (PMTLT 2025-INV2), a prime RMBS transaction sponsored by PennyMac Corp. (PennyMac), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT). PMTLT 2025-INV2 comprises 959 fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with an aggregate principal balance of $338,910,720 as of the February 1, 2025 cut-off date. The underlying pool consists of agency-eligible loans that are collateralized by investment properties (80.4%) and second homes (19.6%). The pool is characterized by significant borrower equity in each mortgaged property, as evidenced by the WA original LTV of 72.3%. The weighted average original credit score is 774, which is well within the prime mortgage range.

KBRA’s rating approach incorporated loan-level analysis of the mortgage pool through its Residential Asset Loss Model (REALM), an examination of the results from third-party loan file due diligence, cash flow modeling analysis of the transaction’s payment structure, reviews of key transaction parties and an assessment of the transaction’s legal structure and documentation. This analysis is further described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.
