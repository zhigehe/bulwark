With over 30 years in the industry, Croll has held leadership roles at both growth-stage and public companies, including most recently at Sonatype, where he led the U.S. Federal business to record annual recurring revenue growth. Previously, he served as Vice President of Federal Sales and Operations for Cleversafe and has held key sales and sales leadership roles at EMC, IBM and Data Domain. Croll’s strategic leadership will allow Riverbed to expand its presence in the federal market, and his expertise in building high-performance sales organizations will be critical to the Company’s long-term success.

“I am thrilled to welcome Michael as Senior Vice President for our Federal market,” said Kris Luhrsen, Chief Revenue Officer at Riverbed. “This appointment reflects our commitment to further strengthening our leadership team, and the importance of our Public Sector and Federal customers. With Croll’s extensive technology and software knowledge, and experience in the Federal market, we are better positioned to deliver innovative solutions, deepen customer relationships, and accelerate growth across this key industry. While many vendors offer a single point product, Riverbed has invested in a broader Platform strategy to meet the needs of enterprises and Government organizations, with a portfolio of leading AIOps, observability and acceleration solutions that enable organizations to optimize digital experiences, improve IT operations and drive measurable results.”
