CRN’s annual MSP 500 list is a comprehensive guide to the leading MSPs in North America. These companies deliver essential managed services that enhance business efficiency, simplify IT, and optimize return on technology investments for their customers.

The MSP 500 list showcases and celebrates MSPs that are driving growth and innovation. These solution providers empower businesses with complex technologies so they can achieve their business goals without stretching financial resources.

The annual MSP 500 list is divided into three sections: the Pioneer 250, which recognizes MSPs focused on the small-and-midsize-business market; the Elite 150, recognizing MSPs with a blend of on- and off-premises services for mostly midmarket and enterprise customers; and the Managed Security 100, spotlighting MSPs with cloud-based security services expertise.

Red River is recognized as one of CRN’s 2025 MSP Elite 150 for its extensive managed services portfolio, supporting both enterprise and public sector customers across the entire IT lifecycle with expertise in AI, cloud, collaboration, cybersecurity and modern infrastructure. The company’s team of certified experts help customers improve end-to-end responsiveness, drive workplace productivity, enhance security and maximize internal resources and technology investments.

“The solution providers on our 2025 MSP 500 list deliver innovative managed services portfolios that enable clients of every size to be more agile and optimize their IT budgets as they grow their business,” said Jennifer Follett, VP of U.S. Content and executive Editor CRN, at The Channel Company. “These are the companies that anticipate client tech needs and develop groundbreaking services and solutions that let customers focus on their core business so they can accelerate success.”

“Being named to CRN’s MSP 500 Elite 150 is a testament to Red River’s commitment to delivering innovative, secure and scalable managed services that help our customers navigate the complexities of modern IT,” said Jason Waldrop, President, Managed Services for Red River. “This recognition reflects the dedication of our expert team, who work tirelessly to ensure our customers can focus on their mission and business goals while we manage and transform their IT environments.”
