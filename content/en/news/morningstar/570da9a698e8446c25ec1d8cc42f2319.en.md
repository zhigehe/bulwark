**Attorney Amy Witherite Warns: Company’s Annual Report Outlines Safety Issues for Driverless Trucks**

With less than two months to go before driverless trucks hit Texas highways, attorney Amy Witherite, a traffic safety expert whose firm specializes in motor vehicle accidents, says the potential dangers of driverless trucks are clearly outlined in the [Aurora Innovations annual report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.edgar-online.com%2FExternalLink%2FEDGAR%2F0001828108-24-000028.html%3Fhash%3Dfd636a78ffc6a1c7263e16d5bc2bdd68af3bbe28f76883011e9d0ad719119d34%26dest%3Daur-20231231_htm%23aur-20231231_htm&esheet=54203119&newsitemid=20250210022823&lan=en-US&anchor=Aurora+Innovations+annual+report&index=1&md5=c29bfb2e0d6af7043b129d49367a16a9). The company plans to put driverless 18-wheelers on Texas highways in less than two months.

“Unlike press releases, demonstrations for journalists or YouTube videos annual reports require full disclosure and a frank discussion of the challenges facing this new and unproven technology,” said Witherite. “We agree with the company’s admission that 'solving self-driving is one of the most difficult engineering challenges of our generation.'

“The company acknowledges that it has not yet tested its technology to the full extent possible, in all conditions under which they anticipate operations will occur.”

Major concerns listed in the Aurora Innovations annual report also include:

* Significant technical challenges
* Limited operating history
* Cybersecurity - unauthorized control or manipulation of systems in autonomous vehicles may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise their safety and data security

The company also acknowledges that there has been “relatively little mandatory federal government regulation of the self-driving industry to date. Currently, there are no Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards that relate to the performance of self-driving technology.”

“Based on this information it is fair to ask whether self-driving trucks should be permitted to operate on Texas roads in the coming months, or whether there should be additional testing in an environment that does not include innocent motorists trying to get to work or school or taking their family on vacation,” said Witherite. “This technology will eventually have the potential to make driving safer but current plans to put these trucks on the road appear premature.”
