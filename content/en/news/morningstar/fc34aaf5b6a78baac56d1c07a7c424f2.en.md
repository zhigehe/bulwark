**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that ModivCare, Inc. (MODV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that certain contracts used in ModivCare’s NEMT segment caused the Company’s free cash flow to deteriorate and that, as a result, (1) contract renegotiations and pricing accommodations negatively impacted the Company’s adjusted EBITDA; (2) the Company had insufficient liquidity; and (3) defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the truth was revealed, ModivCare's stock declined, harming investors.
