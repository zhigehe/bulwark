--Porsche plans to cut around 1,900 jobs by 2029 at its main plant in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen and its site in Weissach to cut costs, Member of the Executive Board for Human Resources Andreas Haffner and Chairman of the Works Council Harald Buck told German regional newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten.

--The German sports-car manufacturer is limited to using voluntary redundancies to reduce its workforce as job-security agreements with its employees prevent operational layoffs until 2030, Stuttgarter Nachrichten reports.

--The job cuts are in addition to already implemented cost-saving measures for temporary employees whose contracts in production have gradually been expiring since last year, according to the newspaper.
