**Carvana, Jimmie Johnson, and Shaquille O’Neal Settle the Score With One-of-a-Kind Paint Scheme for Daytona**

Carvana Brings Shaq’s Vision to Life on Jimmie Johnson’s No. 84 Toyota

What happens when a seven-time NASCAR champ and a basketball Hall of Famer settle their playful online banter with a friendly wager? In this case, one of them gets to “dress” the other for Daytona. Carvana, an industry pioneer for buying and selling used cars online, has brought together Jimmie Johnson and Shaquille O’Neal in the best way possible—by helping Shaq settle the score with his own custom paint scheme for Johnson’s No.84 Toyota.

The design, inspired by O’Neal’s basketball career, was unveiled at Shaq’s Fun House in New Orleans on February 7 and will debut during qualifying for the DAYTONA 500 on February 12.

"Jimmie and I had a ton of fun putting this together,” said O’Neal. “The car looks amazing, and I can’t wait to see him tear up the track next Sunday. Lucky for him, he’s got a better shot at victory lane than at the free-throw line!”

Shaq’s take on the No. 84 Toyota draws inspiration from his classic 1990s uniform, complete with signature pinstripes, a sleek colorway, and the iconic “Dunkman” logo taking center stage on the hood of the car. If there was any doubt about who won this round, one look at the car makes it crystal clear.

“I figured our little feud would stay online, but next thing I know, Shaq’s challenging me to a free throw contest and calling the shots on my paint scheme,” said Jimmie Johnson, seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion and co-owner of LEGACY MOTOR CLUB. “I have to admit—he’s got style. It’s bold, it’s iconic, and I can’t wait to take it to the track.”

“Jimmie and Shaq are two of the most legendary athletes in their sports, and when they started going back and forth, we knew something fun had to come out of it,” said Ryan Keeton, Carvana co-founder and Chief Brand Officer. “By blending the worlds of basketball and NASCAR, we’re bringing together two high-energy arenas and two iconic athletes to create something truly unforgettable for fans of both sports.”

Fans can catch Shaq and Johnson’s No. 84 Toyota in action for the first time on February 16, 2025, at Daytona International Speedway. The race is set to broadcast on FOX at 2:30 p.m. ET.
