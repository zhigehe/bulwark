Regulatory News:

Legrand (Paris:LR):

**Benoît Coquart, Legrand’s Chief Executive Officer, commented:**

*“Legrand had an excellent fourth quarter, with organic sales growth of +6.2%, adjusted operating margin of 20.7%, and free cash flow of €541 million. This quarter concludes in a good way a year 2024, where, despite a generally depressed building market in most of our geographies, the Group recorded further growth in sales and very good results.*

*We recently presented our strategic roadmap for 2030****2****, which calls for accelerating sales growth, both in our traditional products and in new solutions supporting the energy and digital transition, and 2024 is a perfect illustration of our ambitions with, in particular:*

*- a very steady stream of acquisitions, with 9 deals announced over the last twelve months, and a very active pipeline;**- stronger positions in datacenters, which now account for around 20% of Group sales (proforma****3****) and grew organically by close to +15% in 2024;**- dynamic innovation, notably with numerous new product launches;**- strategic initiatives in terms of production capacity, digitalization and optimization of our cost structure;**- a high and steadily rising level of customer satisfaction;**- unwavering commitment from our teams, as seen in our latest survey, which set engagement at 80% in 2024;**- full achievement of goals set in our fifth CSR roadmap, with a completion rate of 113%. Over 3 years this includes, for example, a -53% reduction in our direct carbon emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) and a rise in the percentage of female managers to reach more than 30%.*

*In 2025, we will continue the methodical execution of our strategic roadmap, aiming for accelerated sales growth on the one hand, and earnings and cash flow above industry standards on the other.”*

**2025 full-year targets**

In 2025, the Group will pursue the profitable and responsible development laid out in its strategic roadmap. Taking into account the world’s current macroeconomic outlook and the customs policies effectively applied as of the date of this publication, and with confidence in its model for creating integrated value, Legrand has set the following full-year targets for 2025:

- sales growth of between +6% and +10% (organic and acquisitions, excluding currency effects);
  
- adjusted operating margin (after acquisitions) holding stable overall, compared with 2024;
  
- at least 100% CSR achievement rate for the first year of the 2025-2027 roadmap4.

(2) At 2023 scope of consolidation

**Consolidated sales**

In 2024, sales were up a total of +2.8% from 2023, at €8,648.9 million.

In a building market that remained depressed in many geographies, organic growth in sales was +1.0% over the year, including +1.4% in mature countries and -0.1% in new economies.

The impact of a broader scope of consolidation was +2.2%, including +2.8% linked to acquisitions and ‑0.6% linked to the Group’s disengagement from Russia on October 4, 2023. Based on acquisitions announced and their likely dates of consolidation, their overall impact should be close to +4% in 2025.

The exchange-rate effect on sales in 2024 was -0.5%. Based on average exchange rates in January 2025 alone, the full-year effect should be around +1.5% in 2025.

**Changes in sales by destination at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates broke down as follows by region:**

|  | **2024 / 2023** |  | **4th quarter 2024 / 4th quarter 2023** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Europe | -2.3% |  | +0.6% |
| North and Central America | +4.5% |  | +11.6% |
| Rest of the world | +1.3% |  | +7.2% |
| **Total** | **+1.0%** |  | **+6.2%** |

These changes are analyzed below by geographical region:

- **Europe** (40.0% of Group revenue): in a building market in retreat in most countries, sales at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates fell by -2.3% in 2024, and were nearly unchanged at +0.6% in the fourth quarter alone.

Sales in Europe's mature economies (34.8% of Group revenue) fell organically by -3.1% in 2024, of which ‑1.5% in the fourth quarter alone. Italy and Spain held up well over the year, but failed to offset a decline in sales in France or in the United Kingdom.

Sales in Europe’s new economies were up +3.4% over the year, and +18.2% in the fourth quarter alone, with sales growth in Turkey and good resilience in Eastern Europe.

- **North and Central America** (40.1% of Group revenue): sales were up +4.5% from 2023 at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates, with a +11.6% increase in the fourth quarter alone.

In the United States alone (37.0% of Group revenue), sales rose by a strong +5.7% over the year, including a sharp +13.3% increase in the fourth quarter. Over 12 months, this performance is essentially due to the marked success of our datacenter offerings.

In 2024, sales declined in Canada and Mexico.

- **Rest of the world** (19.9% of Group revenue): sales grew organically by +1.3% in 2024, with a +7.2% increase in the fourth quarter.

In Asia-Pacific (12.1% of Group revenue), sales declined by -2.7% full year and were stable at +0.4% in the fourth quarter alone. Over the year, good growth in India was unable to offset the very sharp fall in China, where construction markets remain in steep decline.

In Africa and the Middle East (3.7% of Group revenue), sales were up +6.9% over twelve months and +13.2% in the fourth quarter alone. In 2024, sales were up sharply in the Middle East and on the rise in Africa.

In South America (4.1% of Group revenue), sales were up +8.8% over twelve months, with marked growth in Brazil and Chile, and advanced a strong +23.0% in the fourth quarter alone.

**Adjusted operating profit and margin**

Adjusted operating profit for 2024 stood at €1,776.0 million, up +0.3% from 2023. This corresponds to an adjusted operating margin equal to 20.5% of sales for the period.

Before acquisitions, adjusted operating margin for 2024 stood at 20.6% of sales.

The Group's high profitability demonstrates the quality of Legrand's commercial positions and its strong ability to deliver in a market environment that remained complex in 2024.

**Value creation and solid balance sheet**

Net profit attributable to the Group came to €1,166.4 million, up +1.6% from 2023, equal to 13.5% of sales with an increase in operating profit, a negative impact of financial results and exchange-rate effects, and a stable corporate income tax rate of 25.9% in 2024.

Free cash flow came to 14.9% of sales for the year, to total €1,290.5 million, with a conversion rate5 of 111% of net profit attributable to the Group for the period.

The ratio of net debt to EBITDA6 stood at 1.5 on December 31, 2024, a level that reflects the pace of acquisitions since the beginning of the year as well as the Group’s solid generation of free cash flow.

In addition, as previously announced7, Legrand will have to pay €43 million in 2025 following the enforceable decision by the French Competition Authority regarding the application of derogated prices on the French market between 2012 and 2015. Legrand categorically rejects the allegation made against it and has appealed this decision.

**Dividend**

Legrand’s Board of Directors will ask the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 27, 2025 to approve the payment of a dividend of €2.20 per share in respect of 2024. This represents a rise of +5% from 2023 and a payout ratio of close to 50%.

The ex-dividend date is May 29, 2025, with payment8 on June 2, 2025.

**2024 CSR performance**

**2024 results of the 2022-2024 CSR roadmap**

In 2024, Legrand reached an achievement rate of 113% on the targets set for the third and last year of its 2022-2024 CSR roadmap9. Achievement rates on the 4 pillars underpinning the Group’s contribution to 10 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were as follows:

**- 122% on promoting diversity and inclusion**, including a rise in the ratio of women in management positions (defined as Hay Grade 14+) to 30.5%, the reach of 94% of employees working in a “*Gender Equality European & International Standard (GEEIS) Diversity”* certified entity. 2024 also saw close to 4,300 new opportunities (internships, work-based training contracts, and jobs) offered to early-in-career candidates.

**- 136*%* for reducing carbon footprint**: the Group’s CO2 emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) were down -53% over 3 years at current scope, 15 million tons of CO2 were avoided between 2022 and 2024 by the Group’s customers thanks to Legrand’s offers that support the energy transition; and a total of almost 330 key suppliers committed to reducing their CO2 emissions.

**- 85% on developing a circular economy**, with average use of recycled plastics and metals close to 10% and over 44% respectively. Moreover, 75% of Legrand sales include Product Environmental Profiles providing detailed information on the environmental impact of the Group’s products.

**- 108% on being a responsible business**, including at least 7 hours of training for close to 96% of Group employees during the year, well above the initial target of 85%; a steep decline in the frequency of workplace accidents (-26% compared with 2021); and a 98% achievement in targets related to business ethics.

In 2024, Legrand generated 78% of its sales from eco-responsible offers.

**Stake acquisition in Circul’R**

Legrand acquired in December 2024 a stake in Circul’R, a French company specializing in circular economy expertise and consulting. With 37 people, Circul’R today supports more than 120 companies, including 70% of the CAC40 index ones. Legrand aims to accelerate the company's development while leveraging on its expertise in circular business models (reuse, recycling, waste reduction, and more).

**CSR Capital Markets Day on March 25, 2025**

Legrand will launch its sixth CSR roadmap, an integral part of its strategy, this time covering the period 2025-2027. The new roadmap will be presented at a Capital Markets Day on March 25.

**Medium-term outlook**

**Reminder of 2030 ambitions10**

At the Capital Markets Day held on September 24, 2024, the Group presented its strategy for essential infrastructures products and solutions supporting the energy and digital transition (including products for datacenters, the energy transition and digital lifestyles).

Legrand detailed its 2030 ambitions as follows:

- **Sales in 2030 in a range of €12 to 15 billion**, including annual sales growth excluding the impact of exchange rates of between +6% to +10%. This includes +3% to +5% organic and +3% to +5% related to acquisitions,

- **Average adjusted operating margin of around 20% of revenue**, including +30 to +50 basis points of annual organic improvement and -30 to -50 basis points of annual dilution from acquisitions,

- **Free cash flow generation of nearly €10 billion from 2025 to 2030**, with average free cash flow ranging between 13% and 15% of sales,

- A capital allocation policy **prioritizing acquisitions** (at least 50% of average free cash flow) and an **attractive dividend payment** (with a distribution ratio of the net profit attributable to the Group of around 50%). Over the period, a total of around €5 billion will thus be dedicated to acquiring companies to round out the Group's products and geographical range,

- **80% of total sales qualifying as eco-responsible sales**, and reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in line with **Legrand’s Net Zero 2050 commitment**.

**A major growth driver: datacenters**

Legrand has built up a leading position in datacenters, which will be a powerful growth driver in the years ahead.

This activity represents sales of €1.6 billion in 2024 (€1.8 billion, or 20% on a proforma11 basis), compared with €0.7 billion in 2019, with average annual sales growth over 5 years of +19%, of which +13% is organic.

Legrand focuses on delivering **high-value**, modular, customizable and highly configurable products that are **critical** for datacenter **to ensure business continuity and optimal performance**. These solutions address:

- system power protection,
  
- power distribution in both white and grey rooms,
  
- rack management and cooling,
  
- energy consumption optimization, and
  
- seamless interoperability with infrastructure management systems.

The growth of these solutions will benefit from global investments in digital. They integrate the most cutting-edge technologies and perfectly meet the requirements and needs linked to the global digitalization of uses, the deployment and democratization of Cloud, SaaS and IoT solutions, or even of artificial intelligence.

**Acceleration of Legrand's acquisition policy**

Legrand intends to pursue its very active policy of acquiring complementary companies that are leaders in their respective fields. Over the last 12 months, 9 companies have joined the Group, enabling Legrand to:

- strengthen or complement its expertise and geographical presence in datacenters (€240 million in turnover acquired in an annual basis), with **Netrack** (Indian specialist in racks), **Davenham** (Irish specialist in low-voltage power distribution systems), **Vass** (Australian leader in busbars), **UPSistemas** (Colombian specialist in the integration, commissioning, maintenance and monitoring of technical infrastructures) and **Power Bus Way** (leading North American specialist in power Cable Bus).

- enter for the first time the highly promising connected health market, which complements Legrand's existing positions in assisted living, with the acquisitions in the Netherlands of **Enovation** (sales €60m) along with **Performation**, announced today. Based in Zeist, **Performation** has over 140 employees, with nearly 60 dedicated to R&D, and annual sales in excess of €20 million.

- almost double its sales in Oceania with the acquisitions of **MSS** (a New Zealand cable management specialist with sales of €10 million) and **APP** (Australia's leading cable management company with sales of €100 million).

**Numerous product launches throughout the year**

Innovation is an integral part of the Group's strategic model, and 2024 saw the launch of a large number of products:

- For **essential infrastructures offering**, these included wiring device ranges Céliane (in France), Light Now (in Greece and Belgium), Seano (in Germany and Austria), and Ultra Thin (in China), wall mounting fixtures solutions such as Chief Tempo and Sanus, architectural lighting offerings REV (in the USA), or Linkeo wall-mount cabinets (Worldwide);

- For solutions linked to the **energy and digital transition**, with:

1. in energy transition: the Keor MP three phase UPS, the connected DPX3 circuit breakers, the Light Up and WEOZ integrated and intelligent building management systems,
2. in digital lifestyles: the LINEA 5000 with Netatmo building access interface, KNX Mallia Senses light and temperature control touchscreen, and the upgrade of the Home + Control application (integrating solar energy management for instance),
3. in datacenters: Linkeo PDUs, the new LCS3 with fiber optic digital infrastructure solutions, as well as Cable Bus and Cablobend cable management offers.

**High and increasing customer satisfaction**

Legrand aims to offer the best customer experience and is making good progress on the subject in 2024. The overall customer satisfaction rate (CSAT12) is 80% in 2024, an increase compared to the rate of 78% recorded in 2023 and 2022. The brand promotion score (NPS13) is 51 in 2024, a clear increase compared to 2023 (44) and 2022 (40).

These developments are due in particular to numerous initiatives carried out in terms of for instance technical support, training and the order-invoicing-delivery process.
