For example, not only can physicians and practice groups find software solutions tailored to their needs, but developers can also gain access to APIs that enable them to build seamless, custom integrations or new applications. In addition, healthtech companies and VCs can identify potential investment opportunities to bring innovative solutions to market faster and at greater scale, and patients can discover tools to track their health data and communicate with their providers. CharmHealthHub launches with hundreds of apps, partners and API options, including those created by the latest winners of the [CharmHealth Innovation Challenge](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20240829245622%2Fen%2FIntroducing-the-Future-of-Healthcare-CharmHealth-Announces-Winners-of-the-2024-Innovation-Challenge&esheet=54205614&newsitemid=20250213760672&lan=en-US&anchor=CharmHealth+Innovation+Challenge&index=3&md5=b22556b0d5b7f054c525662048f505b7).
