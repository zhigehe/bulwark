Shares of industrial and transportation companies rose amid strong earnings.

Shares of Rockwell Automation surged after the maker of specialized factory machinery posted fiscal first-quarter earnings ahead of expectations. "We continue to expect solid earnings growth in 2025, which should be the primary driver of equity market upside this year," said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at money manager UBS Global Wealth Management.

Spirit AeroSystems is likely to warn investors about its going concern disclosure in its 2024 Form 10-K annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, anticipating to conclude that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue due to its cash flow and liquidity position.
