This collaboration underscores Premier Anesthesia’s mission to deliver exceptional anesthesia care and support to communities nationwide, and strengthens its presence in the Columbus area, where it has served for over a decade.

Taylor Station Surgery Center has earned a reputation for providing high-quality, patient-focused, outpatient surgical care. Specializing in various procedures — including orthopedic, pain management, gastrointestinal, gynecology, plastic surgery, podiatry and minimally invasive spine surgeries — the center offers a streamlined approach with a focus on positive outcomes. With advanced technology and a highly skilled team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, CRNAs and other medical professionals, it holds itself to the highest standards in patient safety.

By combining Premier Anesthesia's expertise with Taylor Station Surgery Center's innovative services, this partnership aims to enhance healthcare access and outcomes for patients. “We are delighted to partner with Taylor Station Surgery Center, an organization that shares our commitment to quality care,” said Preston Smith, president of Premier Anesthesia. “This partnership allows us to continue to expand our services in the community and further enhance the experience for Columbus area patients and their loved ones.”

This expansion builds upon Premier Anesthesia’s successful and long-standing partnerships with Trinity Health System’s Mount Carmel East and Mount Carmel Grove City hospitals, and reinforces its dedication to supporting healthcare facilities in the area with customized solutions tailored to the unique needs of the patients receiving care.

As part of the new collaboration, Premier Anesthesia is introducing an updated scheduling model and compensation package designed to attract top clinical talent to the surgery center. This model offers self-scheduling options, empowering team members to shape their work-life balance; provides competitive pay with additional earning opportunities; and fosters a collaborative care team environment.
