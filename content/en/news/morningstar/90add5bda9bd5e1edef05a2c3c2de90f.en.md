By Steve Goldstein

Bond yields held to a tight range on Monday, as investors balanced upcoming inflation data and Federal Reserve testimony with new tariffs.

What's happening

-- The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was 4.29%, down 1.1 basis points. Yields move in the opposite direction to prices.

-- The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 4.49%, down 0.3 basis points.

-- The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was 4.70%, up 1.2 basis points.

What's driving markets

Yields rose on Friday following upward revisions to previous jobs reports and elevated wage growth.

The first of two days of Capitol Hill testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set for Tuesday, as the key consumer-price index is due for release on Wednesday. President Trump said he'll announce new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum on Monday.

"The inability of the Treasury market to selloff beyond the modest, post-payrolls move is certainly encouraging for our longer-term constructive outlook on the market," said rates strategists at BMO Capital Markets. But they expect concessions to underwrite refunding auctions, either in the form of a steeper curve or a backup in yields that pushes 10-year rates back toward 4.60%.
