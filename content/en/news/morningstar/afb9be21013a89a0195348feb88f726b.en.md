COACH INTRODUCES FALL 2025 COLLECTION WITH RUNWAY SHOW AT THE PARK AVENUE ARMORY

COACH INTRODUCES FALL 2025 COLLECTION WITH RUNWAY SHOW AT THE PARK AVENUE ARMORY

NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025


NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Coach debuted its Fall 2025 collection with a runway show held at the historic Park Avenue Armory in New York City's Upper East Side. The latest evolution of Creative Director Stuart Vevers' vision of American classics as interpreted by today's generation, the presentation underscored Coach's continued commitment to redefining heritage pieces and championing self-expression and community.

"My vision for Fall was to ground the collection in all the things that make Coach so distinct as a fashion house: our heritage materials and palette, our commitment to repurposing and "re-loving" secondhand garments through craft, and our belief in the power of community and self-expression," said Vevers. "There's a clear, cohesive idea here in terms of materials, silhouette and styling, and that comes from knowing who we are and what we stand for."

Inspired by the appeal of found and love-worn pieces that reflect the personality of the wearer, Fall 2025 is defined by a consistent silhouette anchored in oversized pants in denim, moleskin and suiting fabric and balanced by relatively shrunken T-shirts, sweatshirts, knits and jackets. The color palette hews closely to classic Coach tones of rich tan and slightly faded black, with added color coming from the materials themselves: mélange jersey, light-wash denim, and pops of novelty in leopard print, metallic knits and beading.

Outerwear featured a collection of cropped and shrunken bomber jackets, some made from repurposed garments, as well as floor-dusting trench coats in shearling and leather, duffle coats, peacoats and a faux leopard fur coat. There were a variety of argyle and Lurex knits, as well as tailoring elements in blazers and vests with cropped and skewed proportions. Inspired by the relaxed day dresses of the 1920s, the collection included dresses in shift, tank and drop-pleated styles, as well as a selection of dresses made from vintage negligees and vintage beaded gowns. More comforting, cozy elements of the collection included washed and worn-in T-shirts, sweatshirts and hoodies, and fuzzy footwear designed to recall love-worn children's slippers. Every look was grounded by a pair of skate-inspired, ultra-baggy pants, which pooled at the ankle for an effect both casual and elegant. All of the jeans in the presentation were crafted from repurposed secondhand denim, an American heritage material the house continues to explore and evolve through the lens of sustainability.

In leathergoods, the Fall 2025 collection marked the runway debut of the Twin Pocket Bag, inspired by a Coach archive piece from 1968. The collection also featured the return of the Brooklyn and Empire bags, now in more playful and compact proportions. All three bags were rendered in vegetable tanned leather, in a new house treatment called Loved Leather, and in shearling, with some featuring a hand-painted graffiti treatment. While most bags appeared in classic Coach colors like toffee, chestnut and maple, the Bleecker Bucket Bag, another new archive-inspired style, added a pop of color, while the Times Square Tabby, created using the elements of beaded vintage satin bags, added some shine.

For its second season, the Soho Sneaker was a fixture on the runway in a curation of new finishes including Loved Leather, silver suede and leopard print. Conceived as a canvas for self-expression, the Soho Sneaker is designed so that every scuff, color choice and customization can help reflect the personality of the wearer, and is accompanied by a selection of charms, including poms-poms, jeweled bows and small shearling stuffed animals, lovingly made by hand and full of character. Footwear also featured stuffed animal slippers with the same playful inspiration, as well as block-heeled loafers, a buckle boot and kitten-heel sandals. Looks were completed with playful toolbox-inspired jewelry in the shape of screwdrivers and wingnuts, personalized nameplate necklaces and brightly colored statement sunglasses.

Guests at the show were ushered through the entryway of the Park Avenue Armory and into the historic Drill Hall, which had been transformed into an intimate, evocative space through atmospheric lighting and printed fabric surrounds designed to recreate a dreamlike industrial interior. The models circulated throughout the space while in the center of the room Brooklyn-based indie pop band Nation of Language provided a live soundtrack to the show, featuring their original song "A Word & a Wave."
