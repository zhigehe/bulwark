NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --

[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598258/THE_ROSEN_LAW_FIRM_P_A_Logo.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598258/THE_ROSEN_LAW_FIRM_P_A_Logo.html)

Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces an investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) resulting from allegations that EA may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

So What: If you purchased EA securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

What to do next: To join the prospective class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=33967](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359719-1&h=4092140469&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D33967&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D33967) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action.

What is this about: On January 22, 2025, EA issued a press release entitled "Electronic Arts Pre-Announces Preliminary Q3 FY25 Results." In this press release, EA stated that "EA's initial guidance for fiscal year 2025 anticipated mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings[.] However, the company now projects a mid-single-digit decline, with Global Football accounting for the majority of the change."

On this news, EA stock fell over 16% on January 23, 2025.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
