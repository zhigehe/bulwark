Sadie was recognized in 2024 for her leadership when she won Entrepreneur of the Year at Ernst & Young Mountain West and made the Forbes 50 over 50 List.

*"We are incredibly honored to welcome Studio Barre into our barre3 network,"*  says Sadie Lincoln, barre3's CEO and co-founder. *"I am impressed with the owners of these studios. These women are driven by purpose and passion and really eager to grow their respective business' with the support of barre3. This combination of purpose and drive is powerful and I can't wait to see the positive changes we collectively make as we enter this new era of growth together."*

*"When I first envisioned Studio Barre, my dream was to build a space where people could come together, challenge themselves, and grow. Above all else, Studio Barre has always been about community—welcoming, supportive, and inclusive.* Founder of Studio Barre, Shannon Higgins shares. *"Today, that community has found its new home with barre3. As we embark on this exciting new chapter, I am filled with gratitude and excitement for what's to come."* 

Over the next seven months, Studio Barre's 11 studios will rebrand as barre3. The acquisition follows barre3's recent expansion with [The Barre Code](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358557-1&h=3236921702&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.barre3.com%2Fbarre3-expands-footprint-and-acquires-the-barre-code%2F&a=The+Barre+Code) and [Barre Centric](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358557-1&h=1797641930&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.barre3.com%2Fbuffalo-ny-based-barre-centrics-three-studios-to-become-barre3%2F&a=Barre+Centric), further solidifying barre3's position as the largest omnichannel boutique fitness brand independently owned and operated by women.
