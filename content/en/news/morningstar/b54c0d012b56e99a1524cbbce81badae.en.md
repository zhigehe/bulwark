Singapore's economy entered the new year in strong shape, notching its fastest pace of growth since 2021 as exports rebounded. But emerging risks are adding uncertainty to the trade-reliant financial hub's outlook.

The city-state's economy grew 4.4% last year, eclipsing the 1.8% expansion seen in 2023 and sealing its recovery from the slowdown sparked by the pandemic.

This year, that momentum is likely to slow, with the Ministry of Trade and Industry projecting growth at 1.0% to 3.0% as it flagged headwinds around global trade.

"Uncertainties in the global economy remain significant, with the risks tilted to the downside," Beh Swan Gin, permanent secretary at the ministry, said at a press briefing Friday.

Trade frictions among major economies and the potential escalation of geopolitical conflicts could drive up production costs and cause more global economic policy uncertainty, said the ministry. That would likely dampen global investment and trade, weighing growth, it added.

Slowdowns in Singapore's major trading partners would mean softer demand for its exports, with trade disruptions standing to deeply affect the small, open economy.

The ministry expects overall gross domestic product in key trading partners like China and the U.S. to ease this year from the pace seen in 2024.

"There is a large cone of uncertainty surrounding the outlook of the U.S. economy, with its trajectory depending on the policies of the new U.S. administration," it said.

Yong Yik Wei, chief economist at the ministry, warned of the indirect impact tariffs could have on Singapore.

Even though the city-state has not been directly targeted by tariffs, and likely faces little impact from U.S. tariffs for aluminum and steel, Yong alluded to Singapore's vulnerability.

"Obviously because we are small, we are open. Trade is three times our GDP, so when there are trade frictions, that would have an indirect impact on Singapore," she said.

Economists at Nomura expect weaker external demand under Trump 2.0 to weigh on Singapore's growth this year, but see scope for continued resilience. Wages and employment strength provide "some cushion against shocks from increased trade protectionism," Euben Paracuelles and Charnon Boonnuch wrote in a report.

Waning demand abroad could dampen Singapore's exports recovery after a return to growth last year, with outbound shipments rebounding in line with the global electronics upswing.

Non-oil domestic exports growth is likely to be modest this year, government agency Enterprise Singapore said Friday, noting significant trade risks.

"Uncertainties arising from ongoing trade frictions among major economies could result in a more challenging and competitive trade environment," the agency said.

It continues to project exports growth at 1.0% to 3.0% this year, which would still be better than last year's 0.2% expansion. Higher shipments of electronic products drove the 2024 result, reversing the 13.1% contraction seen in 2023, the data showed.

By destination, Hong Kong and Malaysia were the top markets for Singapore exports, while shipments to Japan contracted further.

Electronics exports, a key driver of the city-state's economic growth, rose 8.2% in 2024, bouncing back from 2023's 19.7% contraction.

DBS economist Chua Han Teng expects the economy to hold up in the first half of the year, noting that business sentiment remains positive among companies in manufacturing, wholesale trade, finance & insurance, and information & communications--sectors accounting for around 58% of nominal GDP.

Beyond that, he sees considerable downside risks from global trade policy shifts arising from Trump's tariff escalation.

"Singapore's economy remains indirectly vulnerable to potential U.S. tariffs on its major trading partners, and any resulting deceleration in global economic growth and trade," he said.
