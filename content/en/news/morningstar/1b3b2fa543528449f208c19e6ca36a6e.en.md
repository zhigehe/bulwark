NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - 111 Equity is very encouraged by this transaction and looks forward to more information on the transaction being released to the market soon. TheÂ CEAD board and CEO Tony McDonald are proving to be great stewards of the company's resources in securing a company with attractive operations, double digit revenue growth, and a deal that has little dilution to CEAD shareholders. As one of the company's largest shareholders, 111 Equity is very excited for the future growth opportunities of Fat Panda as a publicly traded company and believe the company will be an industry leader.

**Disclaimers**

This press release is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any stock. Any solicitation or offer will only be made through materials filed with the SEC.

This press release contains 111 Equity's current views on the value of stock of CEAD and certain actions that the board of directors of CEAD might take to enhance the value of CEAD's stock. The views expressed in this press release are based on 111 Equity's and the principal's own analyses of publicly available information and assumptions such parties believe to be reasonable. There can be no assurance that the information considered and analyzed is accurate or complete. Similarly, there can be no assurance that 111 Equity's and the principal's assumptions are correct. The actual performance and results of CEAD may differ materially from 111 Equity's and the principal's assumptions and analyses.

This press release also references the size of 111 Equity's and its principal's current holdings of shares in CEAD. 111 Equity's and its principal's views and holdings could change at any time. 111 Equity Group and its principal reserve the right to modify their ownership of shares, including, without limitation, the purchase or sale of shares at any time and may reconsider and change their plans, including ceasing to engage in discussion with management, at any time. We may take any of these or other actions regarding CEAD without updating this press release or providing any notice whatsoever of any such changes (except as otherwise required by law).

**Forward-Looking Statements**

Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements that are predictions of or indicate future events, trends, plans or objectives. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements because, by their nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Due to such risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or actual performance may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the future tense or other forward-looking words such as "believe," "might, "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "should," "could," "may," "will," "objective," "projection," "forecast," "continue," "strategy," "position" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by any comparable terminology.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations set forth in this press release include, among other things, the factors identified in the public filings of CEAD and other information generally available in the market. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed considering such factors, and 111 Equity and its principal are under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
