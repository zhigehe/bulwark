**Northern Trust Wealth Management Announces Leadership Changes**

Northern Trust Wealth Management announced two leadership changes: Glenda Pedroso will become Head of Banking and Specialized Services, and Michael Bracci will be named President of the East Region. The changes will be effective March 1, 2025.

Pedroso will lead a new function that combines Northern Trust’s fortress balance sheet and sophisticated lending, deposit and liquidity solutions with specialized services for fund sponsors, professional services firms, privately held businesses and their principals. Pedroso has held numerous leadership positions over her decorated 35-year banking career, most recently serving as East Region President.

Bracci succeeds Pedroso and will oversee Northern Trust’s wealth advisory teams in the East Region, which encompasses Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Bracci’s career with Northern Trust spans three decades, including serving as President of the East Florida and Mid-Atlantic regions since 2023.

“These appointments mark an exciting chapter for the business as we accelerate growth and elevate our banking and advisory capabilities to unique market segments,” said Northern Trust Wealth Management President Jason Tyler. “With their deep expertise and strategic vision, Glenda and Mike bring the leadership necessary to meet the evolving needs of affluent individuals and families while ensuring the highest standards of service and financial stewardship.”

In addition, these changes will create expanded roles for two regional leaders. Alexander Adams, Group Managing Director for South Florida, will add the Mid-Atlantic Region to his responsibilities. Stacey Hallberg, Senior Managing Director for the Boca Raton and Delray Beach offices, will become Group Managing Director for East Florida.
