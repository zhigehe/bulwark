“This is a special moment for the LA Galaxy as we welcome RBC and City National Bank back into the fold during such a significant time in our club’s history,” said LA Galaxy President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Braun. “To have the RBC shield featured on our jerseys is a point of pride for our organization. As we celebrate our championship legacy and look to the future, this new partnership highlights a dedication to the game of soccer and to our great city.”

The RBC shield will be prominently featured on the right sleeve of the LA Galaxy’s official primary and secondary jerseys during all matches beginning with the 2025 MLS season, which is set to kick off on Sunday, February 23. The partnership will also include expansive brand presence across DHSP and opportunities to engage fans live and on social media. The agreement further expands upon RBC Wealth Management U.S.’s existing sponsorship of MLS, a distinction that highlights its ongoing commitment to the growth of professional soccer across North America.

“At RBC, we are committed to sport and to supporting initiatives that inspire connection and create meaningful opportunities in our communities,” said Mary DePaoli, Chief Marketing Officer at RBC. “Partnering with the LA Galaxy allows us to participate in the rapidly growing sport of soccer while making a direct and positive impact in Los Angeles. We are proud of this partnership and look forward to helping grow and strengthen the bonds that unite communities both on and off the pitch.”

This partnership comes at a critical time as Los Angeles and cities across Southern California continue to recover from the devastating impact of recent wildfires. United in a shared commitment to the region, the LA Galaxy, RBC and City National Bank are dedicated to supporting recovery and rebuilding efforts. The banks will also collaborate with the LA Galaxy Foundation, the club’s charitable arm, to implement ongoing community engagement programs focused on youth sports, education, and addressing the immediate and long-term needs of the recovery efforts as the situation continues to evolve.

“At City National Bank, we are passionate about fostering meaningful connections within the communities we serve, and this partnership with the LA Galaxy and Dignity Health Sports Park allows us to do that with a team beloved by so many Angelenos,” said Diana Rodriguez, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at City National Bank. “Through this collaboration, we aim to inspire and engage fans while making a positive impact on the local community, especially as we embark on recovery and rebuilding efforts across Los Angeles.”

The partnership also extends to the LA Galaxy Soccer Center, a 73,000-square-foot facility located in the heart of Torrance, California, dedicated to futsal and recreational activities. Serving as a vital hub for year-round programming, the facility benefits thousands of families in the region. City National Bank will not only have a strong presence at the center but, through this partnership, will help the LA Galaxy continue to provide a space for families and youth to come together around sports, fostering connections that help strengthen the local community during a critical time.

“This is a significant partnership for our venue as we bring together two LA-rooted organizations to create meaningful impact both on and off the field,” said Katie Pandolfo, General Manager, Dignity Health Sports Park. “We are excited to welcome both RBC and City National Bank to our state-of-the-art facility and look forward to the incredible opportunities this collaboration will bring to our fans and the greater Southern California community.”

“This partnership builds on a trusted relationship that goes back over a decade," said Nick Baker, COO, AEG Global Partnerships. "With both of our organizations deeply rooted in Los Angeles and a shared desire to foster growth and create lasting community impact, we are proud to grow and expand our collaboration with City National Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. We look forward to a partnership that will create meaningful opportunities that benefit both the people and businesses that make this city thrive.”
