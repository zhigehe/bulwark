**Hagens Berman: Maker of Gore-Tex Faces Consumer Class-Action Lawsuit Alleging Greenwashing Campaign to Conceal PFAS in Outdoor Gear**

*Law firm accuses Gore of seeking to hide the environmental impacts of PFAS from eco-conscious consumers*

Consumers of Gore-Tex outdoor gear today filed a [class-action lawsuit against its maker, W.L. Gore & Associates](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbsslaw.com%2Fcases%2Fpfas-gore-tex-greenwashing&esheet=54204498&newsitemid=20250211330708&lan=en-US&anchor=class-action+lawsuit+against+its+maker%2C+W.L.+Gore+%26amp%3B+Associates&index=1&md5=a2a13b18f0593657742c387c41058b6e), alleging the company knowingly concealed its ongoing use of environmentally harmful PFAS — otherwise known as “forever chemicals” — in its waterproof jackets, shoes, clothing and other water-repellent products, according to attorneys at Hagens Berman.

The lawsuit filed Feb. 11, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington accuses Gore of promising the public it was “Committed to Sustainability” and “Environmentally Sound” and that its laminates were “PFC\* Free” and reflected “Responsible Performance” all while continuing to use environmentally harmful PFAS in its manufacturing process. The complaint alleges Gore also failed to disclose to consumers that its Gore-Tex fabric leaches harmful PFAS into the environment and/or water supply during ordinary consumer use and while it’s being manufactured.

Because they do not break down in the environment, PFAS are harmful to our ecosystem, and under EPA declaration, there is no acceptable level of PFAS for human drinking water.

“Gore’s greenwashing campaign misleads the public by purporting to be highly committed to environmental responsibility and at the forefront of sustainable manufacturing processes,” the lawsuit states. “But, in truth, Gore continues to produce Gore-Tex Fabric using PFAS...”

**Going Green for Greenbacks**

The lawsuit offers many examples of Gore’s ecologically sound promises from its website and marketing materials, luring would-be customers with statements of “environmentally sound” products and “acting responsibly” regarding nature’s sensitive environments. Gore even touts responsibility as “a top priority for our business.”

Attorneys allege the company’s “misleading greenwashing campaign” masks the truth that PFAS, as used in its Gore-Tex outdoor gear, bioaccumulates in the environment and sheds toxic chemicals in the very sensitive habitats Gore plasters onto its website to sell its products.

“We believe that the nature-loving consumers buying Gore-Tex products have been hit where it hurts most. They were misled about the environmental impacts of the outdoor gear they purchased,” said Steve Berman, managing partner at Hagens Berman. “Gore knew that its customers wouldn’t purchase products that could be linked to contaminated water supplies, and so Gore orchestrated a greenwashing campaign to cover up the impacts of its products.”

**Gore’s Empty Promises**

The lawsuit states that Gore has repeatedly doubled down on its misinformation, and that in recent years, it has told customers that its products — despite containing PFAS — are “non toxic and safe for the user” and pose no threat to the environment.

In 2021, Gore announced it had developed a new membrane that uses expanded polyethylene, which is not a PFAS, and that it intended to use this to replace existing PFAS in all of its products. Gore also announced it had developed a new durable PFAS-free waterproof treatment. But Gore does not disclose to consumers that only its line of next-generation products will be made in this manner, and that Gore still includes PFASs in its manufacturing and products.

“We seek to represent anyone who unknowingly purchased Gore-Tex gear believing Gore’s promises of ‘performance for the planet,’” Berman said. “We believe what Gore tells its customers is untrue.”

The complaint states, “…instead of coming clean on its use of PFAS and their environmental consequences, Gore instead opted to embark on a significant greenwashing campaign full of material misrepresentations and omissions designed to deceive eco-conscious consumers and safeguard Gore’s profits.”

**PFAS and the Planet**

According to the lawsuit, PFAS sheds during ordinary use in Gore-Tex products, meaning even when outdoor enthusiasts or anyone wearing a Gore-Tex jacket to stay dry, they are inadvertently contaminating the environment.

The complaint breaks down the various ways in which PFAS can leach into the environment: manufacturing sites pollute local water sources, washing PFAS-coated clothing releases chemicals into water sources and wastewater. From this, contaminated water is spread into land, sent to landfills or otherwise in the water cycle, impacting water, soil and air.

The lawsuit brings claims of fraudulent concealment, unfair trade practices, deceptive trade and violations of dozens of state consumer protection laws. The proposed class seeks injunctive relief from the court to force Gore to make accurate corrective disclosures, and also seeks monetary repayment for restitution and/or loss of value of the products purchased due to Gore’s alleged misleading statements.
