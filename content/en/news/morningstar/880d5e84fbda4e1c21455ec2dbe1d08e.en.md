TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - VR Vision, a leader in immersive learning solutions, is proud to announce the launch of Vision Portal, a revolutionary VR training platform designed to transform enterprise virtual training.

As more enterprises adopt VR for workforce development, they are seeing measurable benefits—safer training environments, reduced material costs, and lower environmental impact from minimized travel. However, traditional VR training presents challenges. Trainers often struggle to monitor multiple trainees in real time, and conventional screen casting lacks the ability to control content for individual users. Administrators also face difficulties in gathering clear, measurable data on training effectiveness, engagement, and overall program performance. Vision Portal eliminates these roadblocks, making enterprise VR training more structured, data-driven, and scalable.

*"Vision Portal is a game-changer for companies looking to scale and optimize immersive training programs," said Roni Cerga, CEO of VR Vision. "It provides trainers and administrators with the tools they need to improve efficiency, track real-time progress, and drive better learning outcomes."*

**Key Features of Vision Portal**Remote Assistance – Trainers can seamlessly monitor and manage VR training sessions in real time:

* Track all active VR devices, courses, and trainees
* Launch individuals or groups into specific training modules
* Skip procedural steps for users encountering difficulties
* Send direct messages to individuals or groups

**Advanced Analytics – Gain critical insights into training performance with:**
