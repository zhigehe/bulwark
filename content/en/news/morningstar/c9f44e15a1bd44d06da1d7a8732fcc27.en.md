AKRON, Ohio, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In celebration of the Goodyear Blimp's 100th anniversary, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ: GT) today unveiled a commemorative, blimp-themed sidewall design that will outfit all NASCAR stock cars for NASCAR's Official Throwback Weekend at Darlington Raceway, including both the Goodyear 400 and the Xfinity series races.

Goodyear's Eagle racing tires will feature an historic image of Goodyear's first branded blimp, "Pilgrim," which took flight in 1925, as well as a banner calling out the 100-year milestone. With its traditional throwback theme, the Goodyear 400 race serves as an ideal moment during this year's NASCAR season to reflect on the Goodyear Blimp's 100-year history. Additionally, Darlington Raceway, home of the Goodyear 400, is also celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2025.

The announcement comes on the heels of the blimp's arrival in Daytona yesterday to cover the biggest race of the 2025 NASCAR season. Fans can catch the iconic airship overhead at NASCAR racing competitions throughout the weekend, which will air across FOX and CW broadcast networks.

"Very few brands have the opportunity to celebrate a milestone as significant as 100 years," said Stu Grant, general manager, Goodyear Global Race Tires. "Goodyear and NASCAR have been providing fans with unforgettable aerial views and thrilling races for nearly as long. It will be a special commemoration of the blimp's 100th anniversary at the Goodyear 400 with the blimp on the tires and in the sky overhead at an historic venue like Darlington."

The blimp-themed tires will also make an appearance in the World Endurance Challenge (WEC) and European Le Mans Series (ELMS) at Spa-Francorchamps and Silverstone events.

In addition to displaying its iconic airship on race tires for its centennial anniversary, Goodyear's fleet of three U.S. blimps will also don custom tires in 2025 as they fly to special events throughout the year. Fans can get a first glimpse of the tires, which feature bright gold lettering and a silhouette of the blimp, at this weekend's Daytona 500 events.

**Goodyear to bring the blimp closer to fans in celebration throughout 2025**

Goodyear recognizes June 3, 2025 as the official date of the blimp's 100th anniversary.
