**DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:**The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) FTAI reported one-time engine sales as Maintenance Repair & Overhaul revenue when FTAI only performs limited repair and maintenance work on the engine assets sold; (2) FTAI presents whole engine sales as individual module sales, thereby overstating sales and demand; (3) the company depreciates engines that are not on lease, which misleadingly lowers the reported cost of goods sold and inflates EBITDA; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:**FTAI investors may, ***no later than March 18, 2025,*** seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through [Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357317-1&h=4180869211&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ktmc.com%2Fnew-cases%2Fftai-aviation-ltd%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dftai%26mktm%3Dr&a=Kessler+Topaz+Meltzer+%26+Check%2C+LLP) or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
