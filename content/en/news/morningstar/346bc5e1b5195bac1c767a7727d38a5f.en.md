WINNIPEG, Manitoba--Intercontinental Exchange canola futures closed higher on Monday due to tighter supplies.

Statistics Canada reported canola stocks at the end of 2024 were about 19 percent smaller than those the year before. Also, the Canadian Grain Commission said canola exports and domestic use remain strong.

Additional support for canola came from gains in Malaysian palm oil and most European rapeseed contracts. However, declines in the Chicago soy complex limited the gains in canola. Stronger crude oil prices spilled over into the vegetable oils.

The March canola contract pushed further above its major moving averages, with it now C$23.52 per tonne over the 200-day average.

The United States Department of Agriculture is set to release its supply and demand estimates on Tuesday, with canola likely to take direction from any changes to soybeans.

The Canadian dollar dipped on Monday afternoon with the loonie at 69.89 U.S. cents compared to Friday's close of 69.94.

There were 75,660 contracts traded on Monday, compared to 67,509 on Friday. Spreading accounted for 52,728 contracts traded.
