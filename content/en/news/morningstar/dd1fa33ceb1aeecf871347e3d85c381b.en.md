**AM Best Revises Outlooks to Stable and Affirms Credit Ratings of Aseguradora Ancón, S.A.**

**AM Best** has revised the outlooks to stable from negative and affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) of Aseguradora Ancón, S.A. (Ancón) (Panama).

The Credit Ratings (ratings) reflect Ancón’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.

The stable outlooks reflect Ancon's ability to recoup to historical profitability levels, through effective strategic changes and ongoing support from its group and shareholders.

Ancón’s underwriting performance had been affected by deviations in claims in the health and auto lines of business, its most important segments, which drove the previous negative outlooks. The company made pricing adjustments, as well as dumping unprofitable business, to revert a potential negative trend in its bottom-line results in 2024, which have translated into profitable results that AM Best expects to continue in the coming years.

Ancón’s balance sheet strength is underpinned by risk-adjusted capitalization at an assessed level of strongest, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), and supported by a well-structured reinsurance program, which covers the company’s different business lines. Furthermore, Ancon’s holding company, Ancon Investment Corporation, has demonstrated continued parental support in the form of capital contributions, the latest taking place in March 2024, amounting to USD 2 million.

Ancón is the seventh-largest insurer in Panama, with a market share of 3% as of November 2024. Property/casualty insurance products comprise 65% of its business portfolio, with the remaining 35% made up of life products, including accident and health. The company’s main segments are auto and health, representing 39% and 23%, respectively, of its gross premiums written.

Ancón’s risk-adjusted capitalization has shown stability, despite losses registered during 2023, reflecting the aforementioned shareholder commitment to protect the company’s capital base. Additionally, Ancón maintains its prudent business strategy in terms of retention and growth, as well as a reinsurance program with highly rated reinsurers. In AM Best’s view, this parental support has provided Ancón with an optimized capital structure through a reduced level of financial leverage. AM Best expects Ancón to maintain its balance sheet strength assessment of strongest.

Negative rating actions could be taken if Ancón experiences again an unfavorable trend in underwriting performance driven by extensive losses and rising expenses. Negative rating actions could also take place if the company’s balance sheet strength metrics deteriorate, no longer supporting the strongest assessment. Positive rating actions on Ancón, while not likely, could take place in the medium term driven by a consistent upward trend in operating results that compare favorable to the strong assessment.
