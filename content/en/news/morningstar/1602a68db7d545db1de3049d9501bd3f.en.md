**BIOA INVESTOR ALERT: Kirby McInerney LLP Notifies BioAge Labs, Inc. Investors of Upcoming Lead Plaintiff Deadline in Class Action Lawsuit**

The law firm of [Kirby McInerney LLP](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kmllp.com%2F&esheet=54204580&newsitemid=20250211112409&lan=en-US&anchor=Kirby+McInerney+LLP&index=1&md5=cdf05b0c18f86628645fbda4fc3f1460) reminds investors of the March 10, 2025, deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action filed on behalf of investors who acquired BioAge Labs, Inc. (“BioAge” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:BIOA) securities during the period from September 22, 2024, through January 7, 2025 (“the Class Period”).

[[LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION]](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kmllp.com%2Fcases-investigations%2Fbioage-labs-inc&esheet=54204580&newsitemid=20250211112409&lan=en-US&anchor=%5BLEARN+MORE+ABOUT+THE+CLASS+ACTION%5D&index=2&md5=66727789525be89932cc8b5250142b91)

On September 27, 2024, BioAge completed its initial public offering (“IPO”), selling 12.65 million shares at $18 per share. The Company’s IPO documents discussed its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company in connection with its ongoing STRIDES clinical trial of BioAge’s lead product candidate, azelaprag, in combination with GLP-IR agonists to establish proof of concept for enhanced weight loss.

Less than 3 months after its IPO, on December 6, 2024, BioAge announced that it discontinued its STRIDES Phase 2 trial for azelaprag, citing safety concerns, after liver transaminitis was observed in subjects receiving azelaprag. BioAge stated that the decision to discontinue the STRIDES Phase 2 study of azelaprag “became clear” due to “the emerging safety profile of the current doses tested.” On this news, the price of BioAge stock fell by $15.44 per share, or approximately 76%, from $20.09 per share on December 6, 2024, to close at $4.65 on December 9, 2024.

The complaint alleges that defendants, in the IPO documents and throughout the Class Period, made false and/or materially misleading information regarding its STRIDES Phase 2 clinical trial.
