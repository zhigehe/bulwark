The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Intellia gave investors the false impression that it had reliable information about the development and marketing of NTLA-3001. The Company's reports on timelines including future studies of its drug were not sustainable or viable due to expensive and inefficient delivery methods. The Company was not capable of providing patients with timely doses of NTLA-3001 or even to maintain full staffing. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Intellia, investors suffered damages.

[Join the case](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362004-1&h=2419259071&u=https%3A%2F%2Fschallfirm.com%2Fcases%2Fintellia-therapeutics-inc%2F%23case-form&a=Join+the+case) to recover your losses.
