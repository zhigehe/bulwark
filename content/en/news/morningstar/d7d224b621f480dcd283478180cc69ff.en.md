Mainstreet Credit Union was originally established as the Northeast Johnson County Teachers' Credit Union in 1953, founded and operated by a group of teachers passionate about helping educators with their finances. Today, their passion project has grown into a credit union with more than $691 million in assets that serves more than 56,000 members out of 11 branches across the Kansas City metro area, as of May 1, 2024.

Mainstreet Retirement and Investment Center is led by advisors Dave Loftus, Sara DuBois and Mike Thornhill, seasoned financial professionals with a combined 67 years of industry experience between them. Both Loftus and DuBois have been providing these wealth management services to members of Mainstreet Credit Union for more than 25 years. Since Mainstreet Retirement & Investment Center will be a managed program, Loftus, Dubois and Thornhill will join Cetera as employees.

"We are pleased to welcome Mainstreet Credit Union and equally as proud to onboard Dave, Sara and Mike into the Cetera family," said LeAnn Rummel, president and CEO of Cetera Investment Services. "I consider us fortunate to partner with this caring group of people who share our common mission of serving others with excellence."

"It has been refreshing to find that Cetera Investment Services aligns so well with our culture of people helping people," said Mainstreet Credit Union President and CEO Bob Mayes. "From the very beginning, Cetera made it clear they would support our unique model, letting us conduct our investment business on our terms – all while providing a level of excellent service that is unparalleled. We're excited to see what we can accomplish together."

Cetera Financial Institutions is a community within Cetera Investment Services that supports the investment programs of over 450 banks and credit unions. Cetera Investment Services celebrated its 40-year anniversary in 2024, and with nearly 70 renewals signed through October 31, 2024, Cetera Financial Institutions' current retention rate is 99 percent for all institutions in its network as of that date.
