NFG, with offices in Geneva, London and Los Angeles, is a global investment firm specializing in insurance and reinsurance, financial services, asset management, energy, and real estate. The firm operates extensively across Europe, the USA, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

NMS Capital, a family office-backed private equity and venture capital firm based in Beverly Hills, California, was established in 2010 as the dedicated investment vehicle for the Saliba Family Office. Since its inception, NMS Capital has expanded its investment portfolio and evolved into a leading private equity firm. It has consistently ranked among the top firms in Los Angeles, most recently placing #17 on the [*Los Angeles Business Journal*](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dXG1UGSbKohB_MDh_1xtFMqqA9XZ8vQ_2AjRfaTLNI1H5CAHvvCV8aDRtE8608YRjWkATcZa43pT-Q_5sRsment95jkiSNJFtjgzhkFUylR5sVrRefoWuHFOfTxrqRwaI2TE_bFsBbiN6EaraOb3NZ6_J3IzwkFZdhzubGnXnyghCbUnK1HajBRitloN_x2-)*’s 2024 list*.

NMS Capital’s latest investment in NFG builds on a series of prior investments in NFG affiliates, which began in 2021. While specific terms of the new investment remain undisclosed, both parties confirm that the additional capital investment imputes a valuation of NFG at approximately $2.5 billion. The transaction is expected to close before the end of first quarter of 2025, subject to customary board and committee approvals and procedures.

Keith D. Beekmeyer, Chairman and CEO of NFG, remarked “With this new investment capital from NMS and the Saliba family, NFG has solidified its balance sheet strength, thereby enhancing our capacity to execute strategic objectives and drive long term growth.”

Trevor M. Saliba, NMS Capital Group Chairman and CEO commented “Over the past three years, as we worked closely with Keith and Andy to refine NMS Capital’s investment strategy - focusing on insurance, energy, infrastructure and real estate - it became evident that channeling our investment into a strategic platform company like NFG was the optimal course of action to strengthen our position in the insurance sector.”

Saliba further added “The NFG business model has proven to be a “go to” solution for investment capital in the insurance, specialty insurance, and reinsurance sector, achieving stratospheric growth over the past two to three years. This momentum remains strong, as reflected in NFG’s recent and current targeted closed investments and acquisitions, which are projected to significantly enhance NFG’s top-line revenues for 2025 and 2026.”
