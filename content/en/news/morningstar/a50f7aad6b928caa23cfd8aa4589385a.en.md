STARLUX’s addition of Ontario to its U.S. network – which currently includes Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle – underscores the airline’s aggressive expansion strategy for North America. The Ontario-Taipei route will be served by the new-generation Airbus A350, which features a total of 306 seats, including 4 in first class, 26 in business class, 36 in premium economy, and 240 in economy. The initial schedule will include four weekly flights, as outlined below:

| **Flight No.** | **Route** | **Days of Operation** | **Departure Time** | **Arrival Time** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **JX010** | **Taipei-Ontario** | **Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat** | **20:05** | **17:05** |
| **JX009** | **Ontario-Taipei** | **23:10** | **04:15+2** |

*Note: Please refer to the STARLUX Airlines official website for the latest schedule and related information.*

“Ontario, STARLUX’s first North American destination this year, broadens our market reach and strengthens our position as a premium carrier enhancing connectivity between key U.S. cities, Taiwan, and Asia Pacific,” said STARLUX CEO Glenn Chai. “Serving both Ontario and LAX offers travelers greater flexibility and convenience while supporting economic growth, fostering familial ties, and boosting tourism between North America and Asia. This expansion aligns with our vision to become a global aviation leader, setting new service standards and positioning STARLUX for future growth in the international market.”

According to Alan D. Wapner, president of the Ontario International Airport Authority (OIAA) Board of Commissioners, “We are most grateful to STARLUX Airlines for its confidence in our airport, employees, and community neighbors. Greater Ontario is the gateway to Southern California – a premier destination served by one of the fastest-growing, and most popular, airports in the United States. We look forward to welcoming STARLUX travelers to the convenience of ONT and all that our great region has to offer.”

Ontario is close to numerous vibrant Asian neighborhoods, making it easy to transit via Taipei to major cities in Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, and other key destinations in Asia. Located east of Los Angeles, Ontario also offers easy access to major attractions. Disneyland is a 40-minute drive away, and Palm Springs and Coachella Valley are just an hour away. Big Bear Lake and the wine country of Temecula are within 2 hours too. Driving from Ontario to Las Vegas saves 1.5 to 2 hours compared to LAX, making it ideal for travelers to the Greater Los Angeles area.

STARLUX Airlines currently operates 10 weekly flights between LAX and Taipei, with daily flights from San Francisco to Taipei. Starting March 1, Seattle will also increase to daily flights. STARLUX fleet now consists of 26 aircraft: 13 A321neo, 5 A330neo, and 8 A350, enhanced by the recent addition of two A350s.
