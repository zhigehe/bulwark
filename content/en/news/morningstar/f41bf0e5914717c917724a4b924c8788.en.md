**Management Commentary**

“We are pleased to report a 21.3% sequential increase in our fourth quarter revenues and an 86.8% increase in quarterly revenues on a year over year basis,” **said** **Zvi Alon, Chairman and CEO of Tigo.** “These results reflect the continuation of the trend of sequential revenue increases that we have experienced in the last four quarters.

“We saw revenue growth most notably in the Americas and EMEA regions. Additionally, we continue to gain market share against our competitors while we invest our efforts into strengthening our position in key locations, as emphasized by the events we’ve hosted in Malaysia and Hawaii.”

“For the fourth quarter, we increased our cash by $0.4 million to $19.9 million as we further reduced our inventory and lowered our operating costs. During the quarter, we recorded an inventory charge of $19.5 million, primarily for excess and slow-moving inventory within our GO ESS product line of energy storage solutions, which represented 6% of sales in 2024,” **stated Bill Roeschlein, Chief Financial Officer of Tigo**. “We recorded a higher net loss on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 compared to the comparable prior periods and absent the charge, our results reflect progress toward profitability on a non-GAAP basis.”

***Forward-Looking Statements***

*This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our ability to increase our revenues and become profitable, our overall long-term growth prospects, expectations regarding a recovery in our industry, including the timing thereof, current and future inventory levels, charges and reserves and their impact on future financial results, inventory supply and its impact on our customer shipments and our revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the first fiscal quarter 2025 and our revenue for the first fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2025, statements about demand for our products, our competitive position, and our ability to penetrate new markets and expand our market share, including expansion in international markets, our continued expansion of and investments in our product portfolio, and future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “will allow us to” “is anticipated,” “estimated,” “expected”, “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “outlook” or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Tigo’s management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.*

*In addition to factors previously disclosed, or that will be disclosed in, our reports filed with the SEC, factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, our ability to effectively develop and sell our product offerings and services,* our ability to *compete in the highly-competitive and evolving solar industry; our ability to manage risks associated with U.S. and global geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, seasonal trends and the cyclical nature of the solar industry, including the current prolonged downturn; whether we continue to grow our customer base; whether we continue to develop new products and innovations to meet constantly evolving customer demands; the timing and level of demand for our solar energy solutions; changes in government subsidies and economic incentives, including tax incentives, for solar energy solutions; potential tariffs that could directly affect the solar industry; our ability to forecast our customer demand and manufacturing requirements, and manage our inventory; our ability to acquire or make investments in other businesses, patents, technologies, products or services to grow the business and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom; our capital requirements and our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements; our indebtedness and liabilities and our ability to pay amounts when due under our existing indebtedness, our ability to respond to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and political unrest and regulatory changes in the U.S. and international markets into which we expand or otherwise operate in; our failure to attract, hire retain and train highly qualified personnel in the future; and if we are unable to maintain key strategic relationships with our partners and distributors.*

*Actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained herein are reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise occurring after the date of this communication.*

***Non-GAAP Financial Measures***

*To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measure: adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.*

*We use adjusted EBITDA for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We define adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and merger transaction related expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides helpful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to adjusted EBITDA in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. Adjusted EBITDA also facilitates management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors both because they (i) allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (ii) are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.*

*The items excluded from adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.*

*There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.*

*We refer investors to the reconciliation adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) included below. A reconciliation for adjusted EBITDA provided as guidance is not provided because, as a forward-looking statement, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and difficulty of estimating certain items such as charges to stock-based compensation expense and currency fluctuations which could have an impact on our consolidated results.*
