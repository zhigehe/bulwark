**Potomac Surpasses $2 Billion on the Heels of New Distribution and Business Evolution**

[Potomac](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpotomac.com%2F&esheet=54201717&newsitemid=20250211244378&lan=en-US&anchor=Potomac&index=1&md5=903479649eea521a67837551537e0ca0), an Investment Strategist, TAMP, and FinTech provider is pleased to announce it has passed a key milestone by crossing the $2 billion threshold. This comes as the business has made a significant decision in its planned software rollout.

Potomac’s growth has been supercharged by the continuing integration of their tactical investment strategies among Broker Dealers and TAMPs, most notably their addition to platforms such as LPL MWP, Cambridge CAAP, and GeoWealth.

“There is a bear market in diversification. Financial advisors are yearning for diversifiers that reduce risk, don’t correlate with the stock market, and don’t destroy the returns. Our flows are proof of this market trend,” said Manish Khatta, CEO of Potomac.

The news comes in concert with the decision to give away its Proposal and Risk Analysis software, Guardrails. After its [soft release last year](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Friabiz.com%2Fa%2F2024%2F1%2F26%2Fmanish-khatta-joins-forces-with-hiddenlevers-co-founder-praveen-ghanta-to-launch-guardrails-a-risk-analysis-play-that-rejects-raw-risk-numbers-a-game-changer-in-the-scale-minded-ria-space-analyst-says&esheet=54201717&newsitemid=20250211244378&lan=en-US&anchor=soft+release+last+year&index=2&md5=4f69e7abadf21c649fdbf9af233afff2), Potomac will soon release Guardrails to all its over 1,100 financial advisors free of charge.

“We decided not to monetize Guardrails by selling this to financial advisors. We would rather empower the financial advisors working with us to create the most ideal model combinations for their clients. Guardrails is laser focused on unearthing the only risk number that matters *in real life*; maximum drawdown,” said Jennifer Burton, Chief Operations Officer.

Potomac’s investment strategies enable advisors to match the right investment or combination of investments for each investor’s needs, while their mutual funds provide the advisor as portfolio manager access to a tactically managed solution built to conquer risk. Potomac now manages over $2.0B in AUM/AUA as of 01/23/25.
