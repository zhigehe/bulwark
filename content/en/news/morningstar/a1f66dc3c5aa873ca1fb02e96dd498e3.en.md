**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NTLA) Misled Investors Regarding the Viability of its Drug Candidate

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain.

The truth was revealed on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization and disclosing that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. On this news, the price of Intellia stock declined approximately 15%.
