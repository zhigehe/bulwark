CORAL GABLES, Fla., Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [MarketGrader](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0hxJjszsOpIxsJ_Yv-HrQtT7As84qeEmi_5EmYFZYLbjpqMp7IDUduVuL1lAQnYcES4bNW8jsYV7pRlI-uoS5TegOvK3yLnIjJqh-x8oyEE=), a leader in smart beta investment solutions, today announced the vast majority of the firm’s [MarketGrader Indexes](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0hxJjszsOpIxsJ_Yv-HrQj-4tL_oLe4wxjyzisS55ADIt4OWm7U5_tRzz20rNjprv6_fHe-7b5Rg04PHzW2twbSxUlrT6LiRtTP4KKH4NMlJoYvZfC9CBkNKkW3-tugA) beat their [passive equity benchmarks](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6M1schs-RH0nN0DD7KU3stMj5D2wmzfzIGXHXHq-n4RHL7efiAV2vLqMwgXcAOvM8zQ__Fq2N27pqPnrTUex3lrJHEzDhxzdi3SPu_teejBNFZNb7e-ryC7s_gCb0KWFO5OqcWSXNfGXdfUE62Jrcu5y0wu7Eo5g2wmLlYxozd6zyS0du2T_eM5uCkj0GcF8jIsZot0OwvhFGEuX6u_tBDLbv_1gZfmM9XwDJNBQRKM=) and actively managed peers1 in 2024. The outperformance of MarketGrader’s Indexes relative to both their stock market benchmarks and active peers was even more pronounced over the recent three- and five-year windows.

“2024 was another great year for MarketGrader Indexes when compared to both [widely-followed passive benchmarks](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hbClfd2NB9Mxoko2KYeFOGDsI9guYEmA_ESJeZZhSm_in_rN7Fqmq9H9KljckJFzDenv-dG-Ym1LPklUZt8212dWcd3OvNXXsH35Q09HWQhd4W70g_qHUr1cvpz114GcCOtqOMfky8ibIAfqWOz9_5ymgKV1yLTjc_U3txe1MTyv4wt9Lr5r56nWhmmEiE89QCaNIHKK_C3hi_nfzTgY6slCuF9RjWm9tdVXyOWyXg1_OPYlA4-DtzhYVJgf-nm5Ex7T2bn901fmJRAWzNPviU_mUKBxE9rE0ayl96-0NyE=) and [peer groups](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BKNF4NL2k7Dj17feQwUKpXhFBbigK9TP9ftGrb_S_Vq4k5SwiL-XiNAyst3c-VwxcAHFB61zuS_2CnYkFHTW7NkGAfNjzzhZsfF6kjfCIlRVgIM8a9NXVrdkIlF-myoT8VIH1ZsAhes846DWpE23CWNJhb6BmD5hechk6ym6KIgmV_fqLMYRMK8zLcsk8JWL) of active managers. Our strategies were again rewarded for identifying consistent creators of economic value and unemotionally selling those companies whose fundamentals no longer held up. The level of outperformance persistence that MarketGrader Indexes demonstrate over multi-year windows is rare in the world of asset management and speaks to the efficacy of our proprietary growth at a reasonable price [(GARP) + Quality methodology](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aLkSev0pEvuW6BEATG0iVt2fEIp9REmT5m9BTqqDe3prL2MlXDXpSY1EbMCkWbXhRQpGUpZBm1YK9RCxgv8mYogzOat5rIB400OrNLQ3uXOGpo7h9N2foD1BVrPOF9NK),” said [Carlos Diez](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZGVt1ylUqzeRrAhI1Nd2hhDQyh-aS3Ql67-GpHpZStrPmtxGrhxjQeDw5AkQFa-5o52Q8ZcDRC2UsQaZ_ck-dt2f3R-uQmJCRBt_U7otTqHERDnoAfWEYvBQ7irf5sC4), Founder and CEO of MarketGrader.

Some statistical highlights of MarketGrader’s fundamentals-based stock selection indexes relative to market capitalization weighted indexes include:

* 68% of MarketGrader Indexes outperformed their benchmarks across global markets in 2024.
* 18 out of 19 (95%) MarketGrader Core U.S. Indexes outpaced their benchmark in 2024, and over the recent three-, five- and ten-year windows.
* Returning 37.1% and 36.7%, the top performers in 2024 were the [MarketGrader U.S. Large Cap Select](https://app.marketgrader.com/indexes/marketgrader-us-large-cap-select-index/snapshot) 50 Index and its 100 stock parent index, the [MarketGrader U.S. Large Cap Core Index](https://app.marketgrader.com/indexes/marketgrader-us-large-cap-100-index/snapshot), outpacing the S&P 500’s 25% return.
* With a 22.4% return, MarketGrader’s [US Large Cap Value Index](https://www.marketgrader.com/indexes/marketgrader-us-large-cap-value-index/snapshot) beat the Russell 1000 Value Index by over 800 basis points in 2024, [trouncing the benchmark](https://www.marketgrader.com/blog/value-is-not-dead-it-just-needs-a-new-definition/) by nearly 500 bps over 10 years.
* Nine out of every 10 MarketGrader Indexes lead their bogey on an annualized basis over the last decade. In contrast, over the recent 10-year period, 96% of Large-Cap Core active funds underperformed the S&P 500, while 90% of All Domestic active funds, 81% of active International funds and 86% of active Emerging Markets funds underperformed their benchmarks, [according to SPIVA](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/).

When comparing MarketGrader Indexes to active managers, some notable highlights include:

* 80% of MarketGrader Indexes ranked in the top half of their peer group in 2024 (77% of U.S. indexes and 83% of international indexes).
* 92% of MarketGrader Indexes ranked in the top half of their peer group over five years (89% of domestic and 95% international indexes).
* Top decile: Over five years, 73% of MarketGrader Indexes ranked in the top 10% of their active manager peer group (55% of U.S. indexes and 81% of international indexes).
* The market cap weighted version of the [Barron’s 400 Index](https://www.marketgrader.com/indexes/barrons-400-index/overview) (B400X), live since 2007, ranked in the top 6% among 1,911 active managers in Morningstar’s All Cap U.S. Equity Category in 2024, and top 5% over five years.

“It’s been [over twenty years](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GGrBwllyh1YCIICNgnxLtOnJwgZ_qxWt5hgtjVvr2YRfnpxCZ3BcXd0UPD0QqsUwwweJJ9Lkd7CDUb5sCpBqhQsXAY960bfkZZ6E98LeRcVcktEQh-VRRvMI26LVJRJwHut7GS2aCbC6KcuE7OnKQ63tvUOVNuVK39SWXm1i85JzrXn2BQ-UBVacxRp02kXpTeOpKyvmjal5NT75U_LnYRUiJ1wjqdWyTS_UXB6eWys=) since we launched our first index using our fundamentals-based GARP + Quality framework to picking index constituents. These results show that our unique rules-based approach to indexing [transcends geographies](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ajmk5e6Vvzq0WP4cmG8kQ8UIvpcdHvfiKRaNEfUobc7Zro4zO8-271zrY5SEFGa1JtFR-cdP-WgVYQDWjwfNlshFYIs6evQbWkzA2snR3jmlBabhRT-1a4He5KfeJ0sZagj9gc2i4FYdD1hhzQG_TJrnV_ueF8o5E3gPZ2w8Wb9pdu9GCIDoGwiXdKYSHk1F), market cycles, interest rate regimes, and stock market sector, size and style segments. Index investors can be stock selectors, harnessing the underlying market return (beta) while adding excess returns (alpha) by systematically choosing only the best companies. The persistence of alpha in our indexes makes them an attractive alternative to actively managed funds, for whom consistent outperformance is famously elusive,” continued Diez.
