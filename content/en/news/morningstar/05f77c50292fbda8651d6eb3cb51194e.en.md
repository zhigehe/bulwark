**What is this all about?**

Shares of Semtech fell as much as 33% today after the company announced that net sales of its CopperEdge products are expected to fall below its prior floor estimate of $50 million in fiscal year 2026, citing changes in the firm's server rack architecture due to poor feedback from a key customer. This follows positive statements during its Q3 2024 earnings call in November, where management projected strong sales growth. Block & Leviton is investigating.
