**‘Dollar-a-Day’ Kinetic High-Speed Internet Available for 1.1 Million Homes in 18 States**

* *Kinetic’s best competitive offer ever across entire footprint: 18 states.*
* *More than 139,000 Penn. households qualify for Kinetic’s biggest deal of the year.*
* *23,000 homes in Greene, Lancaster, York counties eligible for ‘dollar a day’ high speed internet.*

In an ambitious move to bring unparalleled high-speed internet access to more Americans and help bridge the Digital Divide, Kinetic’s latest pricing targets 1.1 million specific households within its 18-state footprint; the plan is less than a dollar a day (minus tax and fees).

This is the best national internet package Kinetic has offered and includes hundreds of rural or suburban communities across America that currently have Kinetic’s Next Generation Internet in their area, according to Kinetic officials.

“It’s 2025, and far too many families still cannot access regular and reliable high-speed internet for a reasonable price,” said Susan Schraibman, Kinetic regional operations president for the Northeast. “I’m excited we’ve rolled this out to our footprint. For about a dollar a day, high-speed internet is just a call away.”

This limited time offer is good across Kinetic’s 18-state high-speed internet footprint through March 26, 2025. Pennsylvania communities that will benefit include Meadville as well as Greene County’s Carmichaels and Waynesburg; Lancaster County’s Ephrata and Lititz, and York County’s Jefferson.

The exclusive offer includes:

* A promotional rate of $24.99 per month for 100 Mbps for the first year with AutoPay\*

**Why Choose Kinetic Fiber?**

Kinetic’s Next Generation Internet offers significant advantages over traditional copper, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), and satellite internet. Kinetic fiber delivers equal upload and download speeds, providing uninterrupted video conferencing for telework, gaming, streaming, telehealth, and access to agribusiness. Kinetic’s 99.9% network reliability is a stark contrast to the weather-dependent inconsistencies of satellite internet or the congestion-prone nature of cable. FWA still lags in terms of both speed and latency when compared to the lightning-fast capabilities of fiber.

In today’s digital age, internet connectivity is more than just a convenience; it’s a necessity. Kinetic is a local company with local people working on local challenges. Kinetic technicians are the same people you’ll see at high school games, at church, or at the grocery store – national companies can’t match that.

But don’t just take Kinetic’s word: read thousands of 5-star Google-reviews or see why *CNET* named Kinetic the 2025 “Best Rural Fiber Internet Provider.”

\* At the end of the 12-month promotional period, rates for 100 Mbps service may increase, with pricing determined based on market. Contact Kinetic for more information.
