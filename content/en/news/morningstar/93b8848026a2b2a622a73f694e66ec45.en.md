Export sales of U.S. soybeans missed the low-end of forecasts from analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week.

In its latest weekly report, the Department of Agriculture said soybean export sales for the week ended Feb. 6 totaled 209,800 metric tons in the 2024/25 and 2025/26 marketing years. That's well below the forecast of surveyed analysts, who expected sales to land anywhere from 300,000 tons to 800,000 tons.

Corn sales, meanwhile, exceeded analyst forecasts - totaling 2 million tons through both marketing years, above the high-end of 1.7 million tons forecast. Wheat sales also landed just above the top end of forecasts, totaling 606,400 tons across both years.

CBOT grain futures are mixed ahead of the market's open, with most-active corn down 0.5%, soybeans down 0.2% and wheat up 0.7%.
