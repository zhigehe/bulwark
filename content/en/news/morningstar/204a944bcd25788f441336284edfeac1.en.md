VICTORIA, Seychelles, Feb. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MEXC, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange across the globe, has kicked off a major celebratory trading activity-"Buy BTC for $1", to run in commemoration for the continued market dominance of Bitcoin. The $1 symbolic price attached to Bitcoin marks its journey from around $1 in 2011 to over $100,000 in 2024. The celebrations also include a whopping prize pool of 350,000 USDT, illustrating MEXC's commitment to giving back to the community.
