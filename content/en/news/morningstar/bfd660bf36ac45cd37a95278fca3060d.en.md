New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange will collaborate with Reddit to research, create and distribute new data and analytics products.

The Intercontinental Exchange will leverage Reddit's Data API to create the new content, the companies said Tuesday.

"With millions of daily posts, comments, videos and audio, Reddit captures a full spectrum of public opinions and trends that can be used by financial market participants for aggregated sentiment analysis, early trend identification and custom analytics," the companies said.

Reddit, whose WallStreetBets message board helped popularize meme stocks, had an initial public offering last March.

"The conversations that take place on Reddit on any given day or any given minute can offer a real-time look at the news and trends that are happening around the world," Reddit's VP Business Development and Partnerships Jonathan Flesher said.
