NVO Investors Have Opportunity to Lead Novo Nordisk A/S Securities Fraud Lawsuit

NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --

[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598307/32a64817_10ba_407b_947c_76bd790799f6_Logo.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598307/32a64817_10ba_407b_947c_76bd790799f6_Logo.html)

Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

So what: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

What to do next: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=34168](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361649-1&h=4209422131&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34168&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34168) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk's phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named "REDEFINE-1." Defendants' statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants' statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk's expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk's REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a "flexible protocol" which gave patients the ability "to modify their dosing throughout the trial." When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=34168](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4361649-1&h=4209422131&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34168&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34168) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for more information.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
