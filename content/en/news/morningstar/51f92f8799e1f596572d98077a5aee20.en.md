BRAINTREE, Mass., Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microbot Medical Inc. (Nasdaq: MBOT) today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for the purchase and sale of 6,103,289 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $2.13 per share of common stock. In addition, in a concurrent private placement, the Company issued unregistered short-term series I preferred investment options. The short-term series I preferred investment options to purchase up to 12,206,578 shares of common stock have an exercise price of $2.13 per share and will be exercisable for a period of two years beginning on the later of (i) the effective date of the increase of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock following stockholder approval and (ii) the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the series I preferred investment options and the shares issuable upon exercise thereof.

H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offerings.

The gross proceeds to the Company from the offerings were approximately $13 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings for the continued development, commercialization and regulatory activities for the Company’s LIBERTY® Robotic System, expansion and development of additional applications derived from the Company’s existing IP portfolio, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The shares of common stock described above (but not the short-term series I preferred investment options issued in the concurrent private placement or the shares of common stock underlying such short-term series I preferred investment options) were offered by the Company pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275634) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and declared effective by the SEC on December 4, 2023. The offering of the shares of common stock was made only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective registration statement. A final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the registered direct offering were filed with the SEC. Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be obtained on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov or by contacting H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC at 430 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10022, by phone at (212) 856-5711 or e-mail at placements@hcwco.com.

The short-term series I preferred investment options described above were issued in a concurrent private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the short-term series I preferred investment options, were not registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the short-term series I preferred investment options and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
