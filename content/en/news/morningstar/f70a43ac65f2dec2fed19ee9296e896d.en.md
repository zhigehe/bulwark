NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in **Novo Nordisk A/S** ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit.

**NVO** investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at [jlevi@levikorsinsky.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZaZYNXjpqcYs27TvHo5AJPPyJc8-makVGX2Z-dHvVMulSSqU6BcACoCsv2c-6M75XgsLmZZpan6QZWLCYZTBV-onPlyVINmuo_c2JEUELVA=) or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.

**CASE DETAILS:** According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share.

**WHAT'S NEXT?** If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until **March 25, 2025** to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

**NO COST TO YOU:** If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. **There is no cost or obligation to participate.**
