**CASE DETAILS:** The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

**WHAT'S NEXT?** If you suffered a loss in Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz during the relevant time frame, you have until **February 18, 2025** to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
