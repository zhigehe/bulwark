**Commenting on the latest Tunkillia drilling results, Barton MD Alexander Scanlon said:**

*"We are pleased to confirm further extensions of Tunkillia mineralisation below the ‘Main Pit' floor modelled in our July 2024 Initial Scoping Study. The maximum open pit depth was 256m, which now has potential to grow. Our Optimised Scoping Study is underway with multiple technical specialists engaged to review key aspects of comminution design, energy consumption, mine design and scheduling, with the goal to materially optimise capital and operating costs for long-term value. We look forward to sharing the results as soon as possible."*
