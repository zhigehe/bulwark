***Teamsters Joint Council 25, BLET, BMWED Unite in Opposition to Agency Mergers***

SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The following is a joint statement from Thomas W. Stiede, President of Teamsters Joint Council 25; Cory Martin, Illinois State Legislative Board Chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), and Anthony Sessa, General Chairman of the United Passenger Rail Federation, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED):

"The Teamsters represent thousands of workers employed by the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) under the three organizations it oversees — the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metra, and Pace. Our union also represents tens of thousands of workers who rely on these services to get to and from their jobs every day.

"As the RTA faces a budget shortfall of more than $700 million, it's apparent to everyone in Illinois that the state must step in and save its public transportation system. The best way to do this is through United We Move. The United We Move legislation will establish stronger safety measures at all three agencies, improve service through increased coordination, and reform the governing boards of RTA agencies in ways that benefit workers, taxpayers, and customers. What it will not do is merge the CTA, Metra, and Pace into a single agency — a measure that would create dysfunction, unnecessary rigmarole, and worse service for passengers.

"The BLET, BMWED, and Joint Council 25 look forward to working with our allies in the labor movement, the state legislature, and across Illinois on not just addressing the issues with RTA agencies but improving it for generations to come."

The United We Move legislation is backed by State Senator Ram Villivalam, Assistant House Majority Leader Marcus Evans, and the Labor Alliance for Public Transportation, a multi-union partnership that includes BLET, BMWED, and all other Illinois Teamsters affiliates with members employed by RTA agencies.

Founded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.
