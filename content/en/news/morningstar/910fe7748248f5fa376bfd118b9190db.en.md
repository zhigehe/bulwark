***TJC Earns Placement in HEC Paris-Dow Jones Large Buyout Performance 2024 Rankings***

*TJC Ranks #11 in Top 20 Private Equity Firms in Large Buyout Performance*

TJC LP (“TJC” or “the Firm”), a middle-market private equity firm investing primarily in North America, today announced that the Firm earned the #11 ranking on the HEC Paris-Dow Jones 2024 Global Ranking: Top 20 Private Equity Firms in Large Buyout Performance (“the HEC-Dow Jones Ranking”). This marks the third year in a row that TJC has been recognized by the HEC-Dow Jones Ranking, and the second year in a row that the Firm has been ranked #11.

HEC Paris Business School Professor and Antin IP Chair on Private Equity Infrastructure Oliver Gottschalg compiled the rankings with a proprietary methodology by evaluating performance data from 649 investment firms between 2011 and 2020 that raised $2.29 trillion to address the question of which firms have performed best for investors.

“On behalf of the Firm, our portfolio companies and our investment partners, I want to express gratitude and appreciation to HEC Paris and Dow Jones for again highlighting TJC as a leader in the private equity industry,” said Rich Caputo, Chairman and Chief Executive Partner of TJC. “Our team has pursued excellence at the highest level across our sectors of expertise for decades, stretching over dozens of investments, and we are immensely appreciative for the continued recognition of our commitment.”
