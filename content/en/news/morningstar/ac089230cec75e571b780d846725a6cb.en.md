**DeepTempo Completes BNY Ascent Program to Advance AI-Driven Cybersecurity Innovation**

Company collaborates with BNY on deep-learning solution for advanced threat protection

DeepTempo announced today that it has completed the BNY Ascent Program. As part of the program, DeepTempo worked with BNY on evaluating through a proof-of-concept (POC) deployment its LogLM-based software for cybersecurity incident identification. The Ascent program seeks out exceptional early-stage companies worldwide to create new capabilities for BNY and its clients by collaborating on solutions and conducting a POC.

“By engaging with cutting-edge companies such as DeepTempo, we have earlier insight to solutions that address challenges and convey competitive advantages,” said Joseph Sieczkowski, CIO, Architecture and Engineering at BNY. “The Ascent program streamlines our engagement, creating a collaborative experience benefiting both start-ups and BNY. Our collaboration with DeepTempo highlights our commitment to infrastructure investment, our culture of innovation, and our dedication to testing solutions at the forefront of technology.”

“Our Tempo software sees attacks that other solutions miss while offering significant cost savings versus aging rules and ML-based software,” said Evan Powell, CEO and founder of DeepTempo. “We would like to thank our extended team at BNY. Together, we are building towards collective defense via deep learning and solidifying the foundations of cybersecurity.”
