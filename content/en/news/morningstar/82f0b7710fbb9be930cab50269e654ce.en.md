LAKELAND, Fla., Feb. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Florida Polytechnic University is the No. 1 best value college in the state and No. 2 best value college in the South, according to new rankings released by Research.com, an online higher education resource.

The 2024-2025 [Best Colleges in America](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360211-1&h=3104280278&u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.com%2Fbest-colleges&a=Best+Colleges+in+America) rankings also list Florida Poly as a top 10 best value college in the United States.

Research.com determined best value on several factors, including total cost to attend, availability of financial aid and scholarships, and student outcomes. The rankings were released in January.

"These new rankings reflect our solid commitment to maintaining affordability while empowering students to earn top-quality, in-demand degrees without the financial burden," said Dr. Devin Stephenson, Florida Poly's president. "Our goal is to ensure students graduate ready to succeed in high-tech fields, free from the weight of overwhelming debt."

As evidence of its value, Florida Poly has the lowest tuition and fees in the State University System at $4,940 per year. It also boasts the lowest average student debt among graduates of SUS institutions, according to an analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Florida Poly graduates also have the highest salaries of the entire State University System one year after graduation, according to MyFloridaFuture.

The strong return on investment is reflected in Florida Poly's growing recognition in the state and beyond.

The new Research.com recognition adds to a steady flow of recent and notable Florida Poly [rankings](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360211-1&h=2357319220&u=https%3A%2F%2Ffloridapoly.edu%2Fabout%2Frankings.php&a=rankings) for value, quality and more. These include U.S. News and World Report naming it the No. 1 public college in the Southeast, a top 20 public engineering program without a Ph.D. nationally and the No. 2 best value public college in the Southeast. WalletHub ranked the University in the top 10 nationally for best career outcomes (No. 1 public) and No. 2 in Florida for best cost and financing (No. 34 nationally).

"Florida Poly's unique combination of value, innovation and industry-driven education truly makes us the best choice for the brightest minds of today," said Andy Oguntola, Florida Poly's assistant vice president for enrollment management. "Our students graduate with the skills needed to thrive in the high-tech workforce, empowering them to make an immediate impact on their careers and communities."
