**ISG to Evaluate Aerospace and Defense Solutions Providers**

**Upcoming ISG Provider Lens™ reports will study the relative strengths, challenges and competitive differentiators between service providers to this critical industry**

Information Services Group ([ISG](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.isg-one.com&esheet=54203105&newsitemid=20250210253042&lan=en-US&anchor=ISG&index=1&md5=200cc921f28f115414cb44e5e703564e)) (Nasdaq: [III](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fsymbol%2Fiii&esheet=54203105&newsitemid=20250210253042&lan=en-US&anchor=III&index=2&md5=1312e258ca5b7a6387e27cbc30336018)), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, has launched a research study examining providers of engineering, design, logistics and other services supporting the aerospace and defense industry.

The study results will be published in two comprehensive ISG Provider Lens™ reports, called Aerospace and Defense Solutions and Services, scheduled to be released in June 2025. The reports, focused on the U.S. and European markets, respectively, will cover services offered to aircraft, spacecraft and defense systems manufacturers on both the commercial and military sides of the industry.

Enterprise buyers will be able to use information from the reports to evaluate their current vendor relationships, potential new engagements and available offerings, while ISG advisors use the information to recommend providers to the firm’s buy-side clients.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions coupled with new and emerging global flashpoints have elevated the need for continuous investments in countries’ defense capabilities to ensure their preparedness against potential conflicts. Countries invest heavily in modernizing their military forces, driving demand for innovative aerospace and defense solutions.

Such innovations include autonomous systems, AI and advanced materials, for boosting operational efficiency and safety in commercial, business and military aviation. For instance, the adoption of drones and unmanned vehicles is revolutionizing civilian operations and combat strategies.

“The aerospace and defense industry is critical for ensuring national security, fostering economic stability and driving technological advancement, yet it faces a number of challenges, including supply chain disruptions, rising costs and the need for digital transformation,” said Iain Fisher, director, ISG Provider Lens Research. “We examine the providers supporting this transformation.”

ISG has distributed surveys to more than 100 aerospace and defense industry service providers serving the U.S. and European markets. Working in collaboration with ISG’s global advisors, the research team will produce four quadrants each for two divisions – the Overall Service Provider Ecosystem, and Mid-Size IT Providers/Specialists. Each quadrant represents the aerospace and defense services the typical company buys based on ISG’s experience working with its clients. The four quadrants are:

* **Engineering, Design and Innovation**, evaluating service providers helping the industry innovate in their respective sectors, including materials science, propulsion systems and communications and navigation systems. Customers rely upon advanced engineering practices incorporating digital technologies such as simulation, data analytics and AI to improve design processes, predictive maintenance strategies and operational capabilities.

* **Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul (MRO) and Aftermarket**, covering providers of services crucial to operational efficiency, safety and longevity of aircraft and defense systems. MRO activities range from routine inspections to major overhauls, extending the lifespans of various platforms while ensuring their safety and reliability throughout their operational life.

* **Supply Chain Operations and Logistics Management**, assessing services that encompass planning, transportation management, supplier relationship management, cost control and risk management. Accurate demand forecasting and inventory management are crucial to logistics managers’ ability to ensure timely deliveries, avoiding production downtimes that could lead to losses.

* **Technology Transformation and Consulting**, evaluating services that provide specialized knowledge and strategic guidance tailored to the unique challenges of the industry. Firms in this quadrant leverage their industry insights to help organizations navigate the complexities of digital adoption, ensuring technology investments align with broader business objectives.

Geographically focused reports from the study will cover the global aerospace and defense services market and examine products and services available in the U.S. and Europe. ISG analysts Harish B. (Europe) and Swadhin Pradhan (U.S.) will serve as lead authors of the reports.

A list of identified providers and vendors and further details on the study are available in [this digital brochure](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fisg-one.com%2Fdocs%2Fdefault-source%2F2025-ipl-brochures%2Faerospace-and-defense-2025_brochure.pdf%3Fsfvrsn%3Dc2b7ab31_1&esheet=54203105&newsitemid=20250210253042&lan=en-US&anchor=this+digital+brochure&index=3&md5=bc33555c204fe726db93846909f482ad). Companies not listed as aerospace and defense service providers can [contact ISG](mailto:isglens@isg-one.com) and ask to be included in the study.

All 2025 ISG Provider Lens™ evaluations feature expanded customer experience (CX) data that measures actual enterprise experience with specific provider services and solutions, based on ISG’s continuous CX research. Enterprise customers wishing to share their experience about a specific provider or vendor are invited to complete this [online survey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurveys.isg-one.com%2Fsurvey%2Fselfserve%2F48f8%2F241010%3Flist%3D1%26user_company%3D%24user_company%26user_fname%3D%24user_fname%26user_lname%3D%24user_lname%26user_email%3D%24user_email%26uu_id%3D%24uu_id%23%3F&esheet=54203105&newsitemid=20250210253042&lan=en-US&anchor=online+survey&index=4&md5=68b8ea45914e7ee6607d12b13ff31b26).
