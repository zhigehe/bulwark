CALGARY, AB, Feb. 10, 2025


CALGARY, AB, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Parkland Corporation ("Parkland" "we" the "Company" or "our") acknowledges the Ontario Superior Court of Justice's decision which found that Simpson Oil Limited ("Simpson Oil") is no longer bound by the voting and standstill restrictions in the Governance Agreement.

Both Simpson Oil and Parkland freely entered into the Governance Agreement in 2019 which was designed to protect the interests of Parkland's other shareholders. Simpson Oil commenced this court proceeding for a declaration that it was no longer bound by its terms.

Parkland has always been open to representation from Simpson Oil on its Board. This decision does not change that.

Parkland remains focused on acting in the best interests of all shareholders to maximize value and executing its long-term strategy. The Company will continue to engage with shareholders and focus on the strong operational foundation that supports Parkland's success.
