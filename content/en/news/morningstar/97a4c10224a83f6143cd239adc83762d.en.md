Nashville, Tenn., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Curb Records recording artist Rodney Atkins continues to show his support of the United States military overseas on an 11-day tour, performing 6 shows in the Middle East. During the tour, Atkins engaged with troops at their duty stations, participated in unit demonstrations, and performed at each stop.

“I feel incredibly honored to come out here and connect with our troops, showing them just how much we appreciate their service,” shares Atkins. “It’s important to me to give back to those who give so much for our country. They are the real heroes, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity to spend time with them; the only reason I get to do what I do for a living is because of the brave men and women defending our freedom at home and abroad.”

Using music to honor the brave service members and the families who support them, Atkins continues to prioritize his support of military personnel and their loved ones, having previously visited troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, Japan, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cuba and a host of domestic installations. Atkins hopes that his performances and personal interactions can serve as a morale boost for service members as they are stationed far from home.

Atkins and his team would like to extend a thank you to Armed Forces Entertainment – for more information, check out:
