OTTAWA--Canadian employers continued to aggressively add to their ranks as the year began, pushing the jobless rate down for a second month running in January and adding to signs the economy is on firmer ground.

That had investors pulling back on bets the central bank is poised to lower interest rates yet again, though the outlook for Canada remains clouded by trade uncertainty and the lingering threat of U.S. tariffs.

The economy added 76,000 jobs in January, Statistics Canada said Friday. Employment over the last three months has now risen by a net 211,000, where Canada created about 385,000 jobs in all of 2024.

Job gains for a second straight month outpaced growth in the labor market, and the unemployment rate dipped to 6.6%, the lowest level since October.

The rise in employment last month was about three times the pace of growth expected by economists, who anticipated the jobless rate would tick back up 0.1 percentage point after a surprise drop in December.

Markets reacted by scaling back pricing on another Bank of Canada rate cut at its next policy meeting, with yield on government bonds rising. Traders said market pricing now implies a closer to 55% chance of a March rate cut, from above 75% previously.

"The strength of the labor market somewhat reduces the need for a cut at the March meeting. However, with the elevated uncertainty likely to be a drag on the economy, the Bank of Canada is unlikely to rely only on employment for its decision, and we continue to believe that a rate cut remains likely," said Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central.

While the unemployment rate has eased, it remains almost a percentage point above where it was a year earlier. St-Arnaud, a former Bank of Canada economist, said there remains slack in the job market, with the participation rate and unemployment rate close to the lowest levels since the late 1990s even if they seem to have bottomed in recent months.

The labor force survey dropped the same time as the U.S. Labor Department reported a 143,000 rise in U.S. jobs in January, slightly softer than economists were expecting but still enough for the unemployment rate to edge down to 4%.

When calculated using U.S. Labor Department methodology, Canada's unemployment rate fell to 5.6% for the first month of the year from 5.8% in December.

Canada's jobs numbers were broadly encouraging for the economy. Hiring in January was split between full-time and part-time jobs, and gains were driven by the private sector. Hours worked also was up a solid 0.9% from December and 2.2% from a year earlier.

Hiring was seen across several industries, with goods-producing segments showing particular strength with the strongest month since 2020.

Manufacturing was a stand out sector for jobs growth in January, building on signs of recovery in recent months. Still, some economists questioned whether there may have been some stockpiling ahead of threatened U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada that pulled forward demand.

U.S. President Donald Trump early in the week suspended for one month plans to hit Canadian imports with a 25% tariff and Canadian energy products with a 10% levy. Recent business surveys have suggested companies may have sped up shipments ahead of the tariffs, and that many are looking to make changes to their supply chains.

"Canadian employers are either not listening to [Donald Trump's] threats and tantrums, or perhaps they are listening to him and choosing to add bodies to meet production needs rather than having the confidence to invest. Maybe they are tilting the capital-to-labor ratio toward labor that is easier to ditch than to bail out of cap-ex should developments turn south," said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. "Whatever the reasoning, Canada's job market ripped again in January."

The pickup in hiring follows two years in which employment gains have failed to keep pace with population growth. Federal efforts to slow immigration are forecast to result in the population shrinking slightly near term, putting the brakes on expansion in the labor force over the course of the year.

The Bank of Canada late last month lowered its policy interest rate a sixth time since June as inflation has fallen in line with its 2% target and with wage pressures showing signs of easing. But the central bank dropped any guidance on the future path for rates given uncertainty about U.S. tariffs and the prospect a protracted trade conflict would weaken the economy and push prices higher.

Although the unemployment rate has eased for two months, the number of unemployed Canadians was little changed at about 1.5 million in January but was up by 251,000 on a year earlier. Statistics Canada noted that among those who were jobless at the end of 2024, about 65% were still without a job in January, a larger proportion than for the same period a year ago.

Wage growth also has continued to cool. Average hourly wages rose at the slowest pace last month since April 2022, climbing 3.5% on a year earlier where growth had hovered around 5% through most of 2023 and 2024.

"For the Bank of Canada, there is little here crying out for further near-term rate relief, but the clear and present trade risks will keep rate-cut hopes alive," said Douglas Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. "The moderation in wages does give the BoC a bit more room to manoeuvre should a trade war erupt."
