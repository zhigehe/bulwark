**Creating Convenient, Safe, and High-Quality Solutions for Elevated Pet Care**

HICC Pet, headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, is a leader in pet health and focuses on improving the lives of pets and their owners through innovative, safe, and high-quality solutions. The hypochlorous acid product line is powered by an exclusive pure HOCl technology, while the grooming line utilizes proprietary CocoPlex™ fermented coconut oil technology to gently clean and nourish pets' skin and coat.

HICC Pet offers a comprehensive range of grooming products designed for canine and feline health care, serving as a holistic complement to vet care, supporting pets from nose to tail. While continuing to ensure all products are veterinarian-recommended, HICC Pet has recently launched a long-term collaboration with Dr. Lindsey Wendt, a respected U.S. veterinarian, to emphasize the scientific backing of their offerings.

HICC Pet delivers simple and pure healthcare for dogs and cats, with safe, natural ingredients that are gentle even for pets with sensitive skin. From coconut oil grooming glove wipes and HOCl sprays to travel-sized wipes and dual-sided finger glove designs, HICC Pet redefines the pet grooming product industry. By maintaining a relentless focus on research and development, HICC Pet simplifies pet care while providing solutions that support pet health, allowing owners to enjoy more quality time with their canine and feline friends.

HICC Pet has been recognized with the 2024 Favorite Pet Brand Award by MoCity Hong Kong, following two consecutive years of receiving the Pet Business Award in the U.S., highlighting the increasing recognition of the brand both locally and internationally.

**HICC Pet: Guided by Love, Dedicated to Pets**

The Pet Show Hong Kong promotes values of "caring for animals, respecting life, and advocating for healthy pet ownership," a mission that echoes HICC Pet's founding purpose. In the cold winter of 2020, founder Kevin rescued a stray cat enduring a harsh life on the streets. Her presence sparked Kevin's passion for developing high-quality and safe products that prioritize natural, gentle ingredients, free from toxins and alcohol. That little kitty, named Chestnut, now serves as the brand's Chief Executive Cat. To support more pets in need, HICC Pet partners with Pawsitive Alliance in Washington, USA as a title sponsor, making annual donations to reduce pet overpopulation and promote adoption.

Now a global company with offices in the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, HICC Pet aims to provide innovative wellness care for cats and dogs to pet owners around the world.
