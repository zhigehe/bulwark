"My grandparents [founded Natural Grocers in 1955](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360437-1&h=2798076915&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalgrocers.com%2Four-story&a=founded+Natural+Grocers+in+1955), driven by a desire to empower the health and wellness of their local community in Colorado," stated Vice President of Marketing for Natural Grocers, Raquel Isely. "Though we've grown to 168 stores nationwide, our family remains at the heart of the company, now operated by second- and third-generation family members. That sense of determination, family, and community has always resonated with Arizonans. From the moment we opened our first store in Flagstaff in 2012, we've felt a deep connection with the Grand Canyon State and the incredible customers who welcomed us with open arms. It has truly been a pleasure to serve these communities.

"To celebrate this more than decade-long relationship, we're launching our first annual Celebrate Arizona event—fittingly kicking off on Valentine's Day. If you've ever shopped with us, you know we love a good celebration, even for the little holidays! Arizona Statehood Day feels like the perfect opportunity to show our appreciation. We invite you to stop by, say 'hello,' and explore our wide selection of natural and organic groceries at our Always AffordableSM prices. Plus, if you're an {N}power® member, you'll receive a free reusable tote and enjoy even more savings."
