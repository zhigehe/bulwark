Following that, we recently announced our first OEM design win from a major commercial vehicle OEM,” said Frantz Saintellemy, President and CEO of LeddarTech. “These commercial successes demonstrate strong validation by industry leaders of our products and are accelerating interest from potential customers and partners across the ADAS and AD landscape, building on our already substantial pipeline of opportunities.”

**Recent Business and Technology Highlights**

* **Announced first OEM design win for LeddarVision.** One of the world’s leading commercial vehicle OEMs has selected LeddarTech as the fusion and perception software supplier for their advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) program for 2028 model year vehicles.

* **Received US$8 million advanced royalty payments from TI.** In January, LeddarTech received the second advanced royalty payment of US$3 million as part of its collaboration and license agreement with TI. This is in addition to the US$5 million received in December 2024.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

A non-IFRS financial measure is a financial measure used to depict our historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow and, with respect to its composition, either excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in Company’s consolidated primary financial statements.

In Q2-2024, the Company started to use two new non-IFRS financial measures because we believe these non-IFRS financial measures are reflective of our ongoing operating results and provide readers with an understanding of management’s perspective on and analysis of our performance.

Below are descriptions of the non-IFRS financial measures that we use to explain our results and reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures.

EBITDA (loss) is calculated as net earnings (loss) before interest expenses (income), deferred income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of intangible assets.

EBITDA (loss) should not be considered an alternative to net loss in measuring performance or used as a measure of cash flow.

Adjusted EBITDA (loss) is calculated as EBITDA (loss), adjusted for foreign exchange gain (loss), loss (gain) on revaluation of financial instruments carried at fair value, gain or loss on lease modification, share‐based compensation, listing expense, transaction costs, restructuring costs and impairment loss on intangible assets.
