The show floor is filled with gourmet food from local Chicago restaurants, live music and premium drinks.

This year, two brand-new vehicles were given away to attendees. Michael Schultz was the lucky winner to walk away with keys to a new 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV**, compliments of** Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana Chevy Dealers. Marco Onofre had the winning ticket for the second vehicle, a 2025 Hyundai Palisade, compliments of Chicago and Northwest Indiana Hyundai Dealers.

Since its inception, First Look for Charity has raised more than $65 million for the participating local charities. The Chicago Automobile Trade Association (CATA) and new-car dealers also support charities year-round, through a program called Chicagoland Dealers Care. Chicagoland Dealers Care helps match donations made by CATA dealer members to charities within their communities.
