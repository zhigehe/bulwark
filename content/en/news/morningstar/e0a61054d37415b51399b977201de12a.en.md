The MSCI Canada Small Cap Index is a key benchmark measuring the performance of the small-cap segment of the Canadian equity market. It is part of MSCI's Global Equity Index Series (GEIS) and covers approximately 14% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in Canada. The inclusion of DeFi Technologies in this index reflects the Company's growth and increasing recognition in the market.

**Criteria for Inclusion**

MSCI follows a stringent methodology for selecting companies for the Small Cap Index. The key qualifications include:

* **Market Capitalization**: Companies must fall within a defined market capitalization range for small-cap classification, which MSCI periodically reviews.
* **Liquidity**: Eligible securities must exhibit adequate trading liquidity, ensuring investability and accessibility for investors.
* **Free Float**: Market capitalization is adjusted for the proportion of shares available for public trading, with companies having low free float potentially excluded.
* **Industry Representation**: The index aims for balanced representation across industries, ensuring broad market exposure within the small-cap segment.

**Significance of the Inclusion**

Being added to the MSCI Canada Small Cap Index enhances DeFi Technologies' visibility among institutional investors and funds that track MSCI indices. It also signals strong market performance and increased investor confidence in the Company's business model and strategic direction.

"Our inclusion in the MSCI Canada Small Cap Index marks a significant milestone for DeFi Technologies and validates the progress we've made in our mission to bridge traditional finance with the rapidly evolving decentralized financial ecosystem," said Olivier Roussy Newton, CEO of DeFi Technologies. "This recognition reinforces our commitment to driving innovation and delivering value to our shareholders."
