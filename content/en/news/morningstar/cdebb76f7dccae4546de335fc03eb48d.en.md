In the new structure, Brad Krauss has been elevated to Executive Vice President, Head of Casualty and Specialty Business Development. Krauss has more than 30 years of experience in the insurance and risk management industry. He has been with Sedgwick since 2002, holding ascending roles that have engaged every segment of the organization and most recently leading development in Sedgwick's emerging markets.

The appointed regional leaders are Mike Betti, Central; Mike Chiaramonte, Northeast; Allison Kelly, South; Tom Pfingstag, Southeast; and Todd Squiers, West.

"This structure represents a tremendous opportunity for Sedgwick to utilize our team's extensive market knowledge, relationships and expertise," stated Scott Rogers, Sedgwick's Chief Growth Officer.

According to Rogers, the new growth structure is focused on key market segments and regions, reflecting Sedgwick's commitment to delivering exceptional performance and strengthening the company's position as an industry leader, while increasing accessibility and service levels in local markets. In a rapidly evolving landscape, the company's new structure will promote and drive specific solutions that are enhanced by key expertise for each region of the country.

"Meeting the needs of our clients by delivering tailored and timely solutions is at the heart of what Sedgwick does best," Krauss said. "As I take on this new role, I look forward to driving value focused outcomes for our clients, bolstering our organization's partnership approach, and elevating solutions we offer to new heights."
