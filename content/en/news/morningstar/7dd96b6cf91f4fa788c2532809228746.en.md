**T-Mobile, RAM, Liquid Death Awarded Most Engaging Super Bowl LIX Ads**

*Practical Tech won the night while AI underwhelmed, Stellantis filled the absence of auto rivals, and health-focus brands scaled the TV outcomes ranks*

[EDO](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fedo.com%2Fsb&esheet=54202846&newsitemid=20250210732808&lan=en-US&anchor=EDO&index=1&md5=753bfb7b35a94efbc75ae1548a981196), the TV outcomes company, today released its annual ranking of all national [Super Bowl LIX ads](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fedo.com%2Fsuperbowl&esheet=54202846&newsitemid=20250210732808&lan=en-US&anchor=Super+Bowl+LIX+ads&index=2&md5=32f0ba2c9249df5c03e6e1643797fd43), awarding brands like T-Mobile, RAM, and Liquid Death with the most engaging spots of the night. For a decade, EDO has scored every Super Bowl ad from pre-kick to post-game based on how effective each spot is at driving consumer behaviors — such as website visits and brand searches — immediately after the airing.

“This year’s Super Bowl advertisers were more diverse than in years past, proving that relevance, authenticity, and differentiation continue to be the way to win on advertising’s biggest stage,” **said Kevin Krim, President & CEO of EDO**. “With a wide range of brand categories represented in our top 10, the results show that the investment was well worth it for products that aligned with consumer priorities. Beyond game-day impact, we will continue to see the lasting halo effect of Super Bowl ads, driving sustained engagement and business outcomes well past the final whistle.”

"Consumer priorities may be evolving, but audiences continue to gravitate toward practicality and real-world utility over novelty," **said Laura Grover, SVP, Head of Client Solutions, EDO.** "This year's Super Bowl made that clear—practical tech outperformed generative AI, health-conscious messaging resonated more than ever, and in auto, a single brand dominated by seizing the lane left open by competitors. These trends reinforce that brands can win in the Big Game when they align with real consumer value while taking bold, strategic positions. The Super Bowl isn't just a branding exercise—it's one of the most powerful advertising moments of the year to move the needle on business performance."

**BIG GAME TRENDS**

Super Bowl LIX may have been a blowout, but brands kept up the entertainment during ad breaks. Whether they were introducing game-changing new technologies, tugging at our heartstrings with inspiring stories, or offering new ways to stay healthy, advertisers left it all on the field to make an impact on our industry’s biggest stage.

Key [ad trends from this year’s Big Game](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edo.com%2Ffeature%2Fsuper-bowl-2025%23key-trends&esheet=54202846&newsitemid=20250210732808&lan=en-US&anchor=ad+trends+from+this+year%26%238217%3Bs+Big+Game&index=13&md5=c4bfd5b7e914bc554e222424de701af0) lineup include:

1. **Viewers Choose Practical Tech Over GenAI:** Whether they were advertising buzzy new products (like Google Pixel, OpenAI, Salesforce) or merely theorizing about them (Coca-Cola), ads featuring generative AI were less effective than the average Super Bowl ad at delivering consumer engagement. Instead, viewers were captivated by the very tangible offer of free, satellite-powered wireless service powered by Starlink and T-Mobile — an exciting partnership that drove greater engagement than any other Super Bowl LIX ad and 1,163% as much impact as the average spot.
2. **Health-Curious Ads Drive Massive Engagement:** Throughout the night, consumers demonstrated a keen intent to be healthier, whether that meant losing weight with the new GLP-1 drugs offered by Hims & Hers or enjoying low-calorie drink choices from the likes of Poppi and Cirkul. Flavored sparkling and still water brand Liquid Death was the most impactful of the group, which was 704% more effective than the average Super Bowl LIX ad.
3. **Stellantis Claims Auto Spotlight After Rivals Back Out:** Ads from auto brands are usually a Super Bowl staple, but they were conspicuously absent this year. With the spotlight all to themselves, Stellantis-owned brands Jeep and RAM triumphed. Both placed ads in our top 10 for TV outcomes, with RAM’s Glen Powell-as-Goldilocks spot generating 748% more engagement than the average Super Bowl ad and Jeep’s Harrison Ford-led ode to freedom outperforming the benchmark by 537%.
4. **Women’s Empowerment Inspires Consumers to Act:** A number of ads won the Big Game by celebrating women’s empowerment, and consumers were responsive. Nike returned to the Super Bowl for the first time in 27 years with a who’s who of women athletes and a voice-over from recent Grammy winner Doechii. Lay’s told an inspiring story of a young girl farming potatoes for its chips. And Novartis shed light on the need for greater awareness of breast cancer. All three outperformed the average Super Bowl advertiser, led by Lay’s ad, which was 33% more effective than the benchmark.
