**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Edison International's (EIX) Equipment May Have Been Involved in the Recent Eaton Canyon Fire

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants claimed that SCE uses its Public Safety Power Shutoffs ("PSPS") program to "proactively de-energize power lines to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events." Notwithstanding, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Edison's claim that Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") used its Public Safety Power Shutoffs ("PSPS") program to "proactively de-energize power lines to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events", was false; and (2) this resulted in heightened fire risk in California and heightened legal exposure to the Company.

On January 7, 2025, a fire began in Eaton Canyon. The complaint alleges that on January 12, 2025, Edison admitted that there were "no interruptions or operational/electrical anomalies in the 12 hours prior to the fire's reported start time until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire." The complaint further alleges that the following day a complaint was filed in the Super Court of the State of California alleging that the fires originated from Edison's power lines. On this news, Edison's stock price fell almost 12%.

Then, on February 6, 2025, The Wall Street Journal published an article titled, "Edison Unit Says Its Equipment May Have Been Involved in SoCal Fires." On this news, the Company's stock price fell again.
