**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that ICON PLC (ICLR) Misled Investors Regarding Demand

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) ICON was suffering from a material loss of business due to customer cost reduction measures and other widespread funding limitations impacting the Company’s client base; (b) ICON’s purported FSP and hybrid model offerings were insufficient to shield the Company from the adverse effects of a significant market downturn; (c) the RFPs ICON received from its biotechnology customers during the class period were used in substantial part as price discovery tools, and thus were not indicative of underlying client demand; (d) ICON’s customers had canceled contracts, limited or reduced engagements, delayed clinical trial work, and/or failed to enter into new contracts with ICON for additional clinical trial work at historical rates once existing projects ended (or were scheduled to end) in 2024; (e) ICON’s two largest customers were diversifying their CRO providers away from the Company; (f) as a result of (a)-(e) above, ICON’s reported net new business awards and book-to-bill metrics materially misrepresented client demand for ICON’s services; and (g) that as a result of (a)-(f) above, ICON was tracking materially below the 2024 revenue and EPS guidance issued during the class period and such guidance lacked a reasonable factual basis.

When the truth was revealed, the price of ICON stock dropped significantly, harming investors.
