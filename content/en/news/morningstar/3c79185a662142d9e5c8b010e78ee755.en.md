'The family is mortgaged, likely for more than it is currently worth, to cover Dad's back taxes and credit-card and gambling debts'

Dear Quentin,

I am 70 years old, married, with one child who is also married. I also have one grandchild. I am a retired realtor. I'm not wealthy, but I'm financially well off.

I had a younger brother who is now deceased and who had undiagnosed mental-health disorders. He died of organ failure brought on by cancer, which he had refused to treat for a decade. He believed it was not cancer but drug poisoning being secretly administered by government agents to suppress him for "missions" he had carried out. Obviously, none of that was true.

My baby brother, 52, has moved back into the family home with our elderly parents. He has a degree but has not kept up with the latest developments in his field and has not held a job in at least a decade. He had no visible means of support during that time. He thought he would help our elderly parents out by cooking, cleaning and such.

'Mom is 91, bedridden and has part-time hospice care while Dad goes to his twice-weekly poker games.'

But he also has issues that put him at odds with my parents. He is gay, a Democrat, likes to have younger men on speed dial, makes no commitments and is highly opinionated. He has several passion projects. He used to make $75,000 annually as a consultant to a firm that sold to industrial clients. He never paid his taxes or his student loans, however.

Mom is 91, bedridden and has part-time hospice care while Dad goes to his twice-weekly poker games. Dad promised her he would take care of her at home and never send her to a nursing home. She is very demanding, and will only eat and or drink what she wants. She was wearing Dad out before hospice. He sort of deserves it for his previous behavior in their marriage.

Dad, 92, is still mobile and is self-employed and runs an office with two or three secretaries. He has great income and cash flow, but not enough to retire due to the fact that he did not save for retirement. He says he is on track to gross $400,000 with his business, but upon my close questioning it sounds more like $200,000 to me. He also has a piece of investment property a couple of towns over that is owned free and clear but is not habitable.

Sole heir to parents' estate

The family home where my father, mother and baby brother live is mortgaged, likely for more than it is currently worth, to cover Dad's back taxes and credit-card and gambling debts. Dad is friends with his bank and it appears to me they are happy to loan him whatever they think he can pay back. My baby brother believes he will inherit the family home.

Because of my brother's delinquent tax and student-loan issues, I have been named sole heir and executor of my parents' estate. Baby brother expects me to administer the estate and give him his half while protecting him from the IRS and student-loan collection. That is most likely not going to happen as he expects.

His poker 'friends' call constantly to invite him to their 'friendly' games. He has them on speed dial.

Another issue is that Dad likes to gamble. He says all his friends are dead and it is the only thing left that he enjoys. He goes twice a week. He stays until he wins or taps out - from midnight until dawn or later. He limits himself to $5,000 per night.

I wonder at what point I should report his driving issues to the department of motor vehicles and how I can get him to stop taking his money to the casino two times a week. The casino says there is nothing they can do. The regulars, his poker "friends," call constantly to invite him to their "friendly" games. He has them on speed dial. We have not met any of them.

He is a Korean War veteran. He tells me this makes both him and Mom eligible for the local veterans nursing home if that becomes necessary. I am guessing there is nothing I can do to resolve most of these issues, and I will just have to wait and see how they resolve themselves.

What do you think?

My Father's Son

Dear Father's Son,

Your family certainly does not lack drama.

Contacting the DMV may or may not result in your father's driver's license being taken away - but even if it did, that might not stop him from driving. Some states have requirements for senior drivers, while others do not.

At 92, it's hard to make an argument that it would be OK for him to drive home at dawn after being up all night playing poker, but if you told him he couldn't drive to the games, would that really stop him from going? You could express your concerns to his primary-care physician and his eye doctor, who could then carry out tests on your father and decide whether they should take further action.

At 92, it's hard to make an argument that it would be OK for him to drive home at dawn after being up all night playing poker.

His poker games are one of the few things that give him pleasure and furthermore, you're not sure he's being exploited.

It's a big ask - imploring him to give up the one thing that he loves doing, especially given that his wife is dependent on him and these two nights are the only time he gets to spend by himself. He's 92 and, statistically speaking, he won't be around for many more years. If he is independent and healthy enough to play poker, it may be that he is well enough to drive.

"Mandatory reporting requirements for unsafe driving vary by state," according to Aging Care. "Doctors often find themselves in a gray area when it comes to doing no harm to a patient, maintaining confidentiality and following their state's reporting rules." Eyesight is one very black-and-white requirement, so your campaign may rise or fall on this issue.

There are many moving parts here. "There are no national standards or mandates for licensing drivers or revoking these privileges," Aging Care adds. "Keep in mind that some states maintain the anonymity of the person who made the request for evaluation, while others can share this information with the driver in question if he or she asks for it." AAA may also be able to help.

Further steps, down the line

You are fortunate that your younger brother lives with your parents and, while he may not be financially independent, he is able to keep an eye on things. As he is there all the time, ask him for his opinion before calling a casual family meeting with your father to discuss his finances in order to make sure that they are not being squandered.

Taking $5,000 to a poker game sounds like high stakes, and it may help to enlist the support of a financial adviser. Even if your father is a poker genius, talking to an adviser would give you more insight into his savings, life insurance and any other accounts. I assume your father has made a will, if you are the heir to his estate. Has he given you or anyone else medical or financial power of attorney?

Options include calling your father's bank and alerting them to any unusual transactions and, as a last resort, applying to be a guardian or conservator.

As for your father's finances, there are a few steps you could take, however unwelcome they may be to him. If you talk to him first, perhaps you two could come to some kind of compromise. Options include calling your father's bank and alerting them to any unusual transactions and, as a last resort, applying to be a guardian or conservator or to obtain power of attorney over his medical and financial affairs.

A durable power of attorney gives the agent - you or a third party - the power to make financial and medical decisions should your father become incapacitated for a period of time. This is often used for an elderly parent with cognitive decline, for example, or if a loved one has an accident and ends up in a coma.

If you do get such legal authority, you should freeze his credit at Experian (EXPGY), TransUnion (TRU) and Equifax (EFX). Put his documents, including his Social Security number, in a safe place. The National Careline, among other organizations, offers advice on next steps and, if necessary, reporting his poker games to adult protective services.

Approach with sensitivity and compassion - and take it one issue at a time.
