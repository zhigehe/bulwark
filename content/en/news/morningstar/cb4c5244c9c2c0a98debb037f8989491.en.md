**DAT iQ heads to Manifest Vegas to help shippers and brokers prep for a volatile year**

DAT Freight & Analytics will showcase its DAT iQ analytics platform for shippers and a new carrier identity-authentication system for DAT One customers at Manifest Vegas 2025, the largest global gathering of supply chain technologies and professionals, from February 10-12.

“Already, 2025 is generating volatility and opportunity for shippers and freight brokers,” said DAT CEO & President Jeff Clementz. “Manifest is a great place to learn how we equip customers with the analytics and security solutions they need to build trusted relationships and navigate the evolving market.”

DAT will feature several products at Manifest:

* DAT iQ Benchmark delivers unmatched rate visibility and validation, network analysis, and predictive analytics for freight shippers and brokers, with pricing models trained on $1 trillion in customer-submitted transactions since 2010.
* Carrier Management Suite builds carrier authentication directly into the DAT One freight-match network. It eliminates the need for separate vendors to vet, onboard, track, and tender loads.
* Trucker Tools, acquired by DAT in December 2024, will exhibit its products for brokers at Booth 411, including its proven approach to using telematics for tracking freight and validating carrier identities.

**Connect with DAT at Manifest:**

* Visit DAT at Booth 1032 and Trucker Tools at Booth 411.
* Join us at our Shipper Reception on Tuesday, February 11, for exclusive networking opportunities with peers, DAT Chief Scientist Dr. Chris Caplice, and the DAT iQ team. Visit the DAT booth for more information.
* Set up a meeting for a dedicated time to talk about your specific challenges.

“Our expert guidance at Manifest gives shippers and brokers the insight they need to make the most of their investment in freight intelligence and analytics,” said DAT CEO & President Jeff Clementz. “We would love a chance to show you how.”
