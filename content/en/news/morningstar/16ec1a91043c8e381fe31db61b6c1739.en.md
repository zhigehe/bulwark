The mDL Technology Showcase, sponsored by oneproof, will explore the groundbreaking potential of mDLs for combatting fraud and improving secure authentication processes while offering users full control over their data. It will bring together key stakeholders to demonstrate real-world mDL use cases, including, but not limited to, online bank onboarding, point of sale age verification, TSA ID verification, reusable identity verification (IDV) for remote proofing and cannabis purchases at the point of sale.

The meeting will feature several sessions focused on cross-industry collaboration and professional development for Secure Technology Alliance members. HID will open the meeting with a thought-provoking session by Strategic Advisor Allen Ganz. It will delve into the evolution of facial recognition in payments, leveraging global case studies to demonstrate how it enhances payment security, convenience and speed and offers a glimpse into the technology's present and future potential. The meeting agenda will also include a collaborative panel with EMVCo, and sessions on FIDO passkeys, magstripe retirement, EMV 3-D Secure and an interactive merchant and issuer special interest group (SIG).
