About the Lawsuit

FTAI and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On January 15, 2025, Muddy Waters Research reported that, among other things, “FTAI materially manipulates its financials” by “exaggerating the size of its aftermarket aerospace business”, “misleading investors by presenting whole engine sales as individual module sales”, “inflating Aerospace Products’ EBITDA margins by means of over-depreciation in the leasing segment”, and “engaging in channel stuffing.” On this news, the price of FTAI’s stock fell over 24%, to close at $116.08 per share on January 15, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The case is *Shannahan v. FTAI Aviation Ltd., et al.,* No. 25-cv-541.
