First-time guests often ask, 'What makes a Freddy's steakburger special?' Freddy's starts with premium, lean ground beef pressed thin and seared on a flat-top grill to create deliciously crispy, caramelized edges and a juicy center. Every steakburger is cooked to order and sprinkled with Freddy's Famous Fry Seasoning. We regularly recommend the Original Double, which comes standard with two patties, two slices of cheese, mustard, onion slices and pickle planks.
