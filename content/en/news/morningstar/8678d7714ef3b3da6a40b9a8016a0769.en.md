WASHINGTON, Feb. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- May Jung LLP, a leading civil rights law firm, filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction yesterday, Friday, February 7, 2025,  against the District of Columbia in U.S. District Court on behalf of six Black female residents displaced from their homes in Southeast D.C. due to a crumbling and unsafe structure funded with over 6 million dollars of taxpayer money.

The motion states that the District failed to provide critical information about tax implications as previously agreed, refused to engage in good faith discussions about reasonable accommodations to its arbitrarily-imposed February 10, 2025 deadline for Plaintiffs to make material decisions regarding their property rights and housing vouchers.

The motion seeks the intervention to allow Plaintiffs more than a few days to make life-alerting decisions without sufficient information and clarification of the far-reaching consequences impacting their families, financial  stability, and future homes.

All the Plaintiffs are Black women, who at the time of purchase, were first-time homebuyers with low-to-moderate income and were eligible to purchase a home constructed using Housing Production Trust Funds (HPTF). The residents purchased their homes between 2017 and 2018.

"At every turn, the District has abused its power to destroy the hopes and dreams of these Black women," stated Je Yon Jung, Attorney for Plaintiffs.  She continued, "the District's pattern of deception and unfairness throughout this litigation is beyond comprehension. After sitting on their hands for nearly four years to only force these vulnerable and displaced women and their families to make one of the most significant decision of their lives within ten days or to face a threat of a $3 million dollar condemnation bill is blatantly coercive and manipulative. It speaks volumes about how disingenuous the District is when it touts affordable housing for all of its residents."

"The District believes that it is not only above the law but that it can change the law and do whatever it chooses to you as long as you are Black and Poor," said Attorney LaRuby May.  "We will continue to fight the District and force them to treat all District residents, not just wealthy White residents living in Northwest, with justice and respect."
