**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:**Cassava investors may, ***no later than February 10, 2025,*** seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through [Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357260-1&h=1683433829&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ktmc.com%2Fnew-cases%2Fcassava-sciences-inc-2024%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dsava%26mktm%3Dr&a=Kessler+Topaz+Meltzer+%26+Check%2C+LLP) or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
