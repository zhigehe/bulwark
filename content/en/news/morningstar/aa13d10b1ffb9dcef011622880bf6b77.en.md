**Ninety-three percent of UK Companies Experienced Vendor Fraud in 2024, According to New Trustpair Research**

**Key Findings:**

* AI-powered fraud techniques, including generative AI and deepfakes, have accelerated fraud incidents, with 42% of companies experiencing at least two successful attacks.
* Financial losses are steep: 21% of fraud victims report average losses of £500,000 per attack.
* Overconfidence in fraud detection capabilities persists despite escalating threats, with 44% of executives claiming they are “very confident” in their teams’ abilities.
* Cybersecurity awareness training and technology investments are rising, but manual processes remain vulnerable.

Cyber fraud, including advanced schemes like AI-generated scams and business email compromise (BEC), surged across UK businesses in 2024, according to new data released today by [Trustpair](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftrustpair.com%2F&esheet=54201211&newsitemid=20250211180324&lan=en-US&anchor=Trustpair&index=1&md5=eb6bb2079d2e5f71d4bb79eecc52b0e4) and OpinionWay. Based on a survey of 150 senior finance, treasury, and accounts payable executives across the UK, the research shows that 93% of companies were targeted by fraud in the past year, with 73% expecting risks to grow in 2025.

Fraudsters have rapidly embraced tools like generative AI, voice cloning, and deepfakes, driving a rise in payment fraud sophistication. Nearly 48% identify cyber attacks as their biggest hurdle in fraud prevention. Trustpair’s study highlights an unsettling trend: while 94% of businesses increased their investment in fraud prevention technologies last year, reliance on reactive methods like manual checks and training leaves companies vulnerable to evolving tactics.

“The rise of AI-driven fraud demands a fundamental shift in how businesses approach payment security,” says **Tom Abbey, Senior Fraud Consultant UK at Trustpair**. “Companies cannot rely solely on human intervention to counter such sophisticated attacks. Automation is the only way to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.”

**Key Trends from the Report – *Fraud in the Cyber Era: 2025 UK Fraud Trends & Insights***

1. **AI-Powered Fraud is a Game-Changer**Nearly 88% of UK businesses identified cyber fraud as a significant driver of payment fraud. Tools like generative AI enable fraudsters to craft convincing BEC scams that mimic executives’ communication styles, outpacing traditional detection measures.
2. **The Financial Toll of Fraud is Alarming**For 21% of businesses that suffered successful fraud attacks, the average loss per incident was £500,000. Despite 94% of companies increasing their technology budgets, only **33%** have automated fraud prevention systems in place.
3. **Financial Professionals Confidence Does Not Match Reality**While **97%** of executives believe their teams can identify advanced fraud tactics, the rising number of successful attacks suggests overconfidence in outdated defenses. Bridging this gap requires adopting more proactive, technology-driven solutions.
4. **A Unified Approach is Essential**Cybersecurity awareness training and technology investments are on the rise. However, only **1 in 10 companies** performs consistent checks throughout the supplier payment process.

**Companies Aren’t Ready for a Fraud Surge**Trustpair’s findings indicate a lack of preparedness for the growing sophistication of fraud threats. Manual methods, such as callbacks and email-based validations, are still widely used by **70%** of companies. While awareness training and policy updates are critical, automation and advanced verification systems must become the cornerstone of fraud prevention strategies.
