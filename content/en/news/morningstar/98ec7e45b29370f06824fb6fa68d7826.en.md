Its native token, CoinEx Token ([CET](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BTvTwm47o0BK1tzK_Fvw7KiM_yfmDw4AaUFwf-f4_GZbIk0AaTFswn8TK5sX3tRRhY3wwdnc8ffqo5gQVew42w==)), serves as a crucial value exchange medium within the CoinEx ecosystem. The total CET issued is 10 billion and according to its value agreement, CoinEx allocates 20 percent of the daily trading fee income to repurchase CET, and these CET will be burnt at the end of each calendar month. The repurchase and burning process continues until CET is reduced to zero.

Since its launch, CET has been issued and circulated via various channels, including airdrops, global market promotions, team incentives, trading fee rebates and many others. CoinEx has set up the entire mechanism of CET in such a way that the continuous repurchase and burning will gradually decrease the supply of CET, adding to the long-term value of the tokens.

CoinEx has been aggressively investing into new innovations such as one-click cryptocurrency swap module, P2P platform, CoinEx staking dashboard, CoinEx Mining pool, PreToken Trading for early-stage altcoins and Futures Copy Trading toolkit.
