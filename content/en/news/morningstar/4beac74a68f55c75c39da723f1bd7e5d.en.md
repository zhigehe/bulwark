SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Advisory Committee provides strategic guidance to promote equitable and accessible healthcare. By holding organizations accountable to measurable benchmarks put in place by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Committee aims to close gaps in care, reduce health disparities, and enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare for all communities. Assigning the responsibility to the healthcare facility performing a set of the most profitable procedures to account for everything including communication and coordination of the patients 30 days post-surgery. Aligning incentives of health systems with the patient with ramifications that would affect up to 15% of total Medicare revenue of those facilities on the mandated list.
