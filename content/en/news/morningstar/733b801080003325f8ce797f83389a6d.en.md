**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Misled Investors Regarding the Stability of its Sales Operations

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) Elastic had implemented significant changes to its sales operations, particularly with respect to its customer segments in the Americas; (ii) the foregoing changes were likely to, and did, disrupt Elastic's sales operations during the first quarter of its FY 2025; (iii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the stability of Elastic's sales operations; (iv) as a result of all the foregoing, Elastic was unlikely to meet its own previously issued revenue guidance for its FY 2025; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

The complaint alleges that on August 29, 2024, Elastic announced financial results for first quarter FY 2025, including that the Company was slashing its FY 2025 revenue guidance. On this news, Elastic's ordinary share price fell $27.45 per share, or 26.49%, to close at $76.19 per share on August 30, 2024.
