By Jiahui Huang

China Vanke secured a $383.3 million loan from a major state-owned shareholder at very attractive interest rate as the property developer continues to address its liquidity issues.

The Shenzhen-based company said in a filing late Monday that it received the loan from Shenzhen Metro Group, which is a state-owned subway operator in one of the biggest cities in China. The loan was at interest rate of 2.34%, below China's one-year loan prime rate at 3.1%.

China Vanke pledged some of its shares in Onewo, its logistic and residential property services unit, as collateral.

China Vanke and other Chinese property developers have been trying to deal with a mountain of debt amid a sputtering real estate market for over three years. Several property developers such as giant Evergrande have either faced winding-up petitions for its offshore debt in Hong Kong courts or been liquidated. But China Vanke has been receiving support from state-owned Shenzhen Metro, which is China Vanke's biggest shareholder with a 27% stake.

Given that Shenzhen Metro is a state-owned enterprise with strong financials, "we believe that its direct involvement on the Vanke's operation should help solve its liquidity issue eventually and to restore homebuyers' confidence on Vanke projects," CGS International analyst Raymong Cheng wrote in an email.

Shenzhen Metro's chairman Xin Jie replaced Yu Liang as China Vanke's chairman for its board of directors in late January, a move that the company said was to partly help leverage Shenzhen Metro's resources.

Vanke's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 0.9% by midday Tuesday, bringing the company's gains this year to 4.0%. Its Shenzhen-listed shares fell 1.5%.
