COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 7, 2025

Rather than investing the average of $8 million in a traditional Big Game commercial, Goodwin's "Almost Ad" leverages targeted engagement through social media, directly reaching brokers and operators in the charter aviation industry. The campaign draws on Douglas' 1990 upset victory over Mike Tyson—one of the most memorable underdog stories in sports history—as a metaphor for how technology can help professionals compete in an evolving market.

Goodwin Co-Founder Tolga Demirel shares the parallels between the nineties upset and what the company is building.

"Buster Douglas showed the world what's possible when preparation meets opportunity, and that's exactly what we're doing for brokers and operators," Demirel said. "Charter aviation is changing fast, and independent brokers and operators need the right tools to compete and grow. We're building technology that levels the playing field, helping them achieve bigger wins in a competitive market."

Through the campaign, Goodwin focused on reaching the right audience, not the biggest audience and continuing to focus efforts on building revolutionary technology.

"Big Game ads create broad awareness, but our goal is to connect directly with the professionals who can benefit from our platform," Demirel said. "This campaign reflects our belief in smart, effective strategies that drive real value."

By focusing on a highly engaged professional audience rather than broad consumer exposure, Goodwin is reinforcing its position as a tech-forward leader in charter aviation. The campaign's digital-first strategy aligns with the company's mission to modernize and streamline the charter booking experience

"This campaign underscores what we stand for—innovation, efficiency and supporting our partners with the technology they need to succeed. Rather than following traditional advertising playbooks, we're investing in direct engagement that drives impact," Demirel said.

The "Almost Ad" campaign is now live on social media. To learn more about Goodwin or to watch the campaign, visit [Goodwin's YouTube channel.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358065-1&h=2227212099&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40GoodwinSoftwareCompany&a=Goodwin%27s+YouTube+channel.+)
