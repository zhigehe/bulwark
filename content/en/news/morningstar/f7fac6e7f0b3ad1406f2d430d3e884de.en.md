**CASE DETAILS:** The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (i) IIPR was experiencing significant declines in rent and property-management fees in connection with certain customer leases; (ii) the foregoing would likely impair the Company’s ability to maintain funds from operations and revenue growth; (iii) accordingly, IIPR’s leasing operations were less profitable than the Company had represented to investors; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

**WHAT'S NEXT?** If you suffered a loss in Innovative Industrial Properties during the relevant time frame, you have until **March 18, 2025** to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
