NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC ("KSF"), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("the Company") (NYSE: EW).

On July 24, 2024, the Company announced its financial results for the second quarter of the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2024 disclosing disappointing results, specifically that the Company slashed its full-year revenue guidance for the Company's core product, the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ("TAVR") platform due to "continued growth and expansion of structural heart therapies … [which] put pressure on hospital workflows."

Thereafter, the Company and certain of its executives were sued in a securities class action lawsuit, charging them with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period in violation of federal securities laws, which remains ongoing.

KSF's investigation is focusing on whether Edwards' officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to its shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.
