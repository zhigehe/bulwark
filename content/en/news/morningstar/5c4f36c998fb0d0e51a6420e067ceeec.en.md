**Rio Tinto donates A$750,000 to Queensland flood relief and recovery efforts**

Rio Tinto has donated A$750,000 to support disaster relief efforts for those impacted by the widespread floods in North Queensland.

The funds will support the work of key organisations, including the Queensland Royal Flying Doctors Service (RFDS) and the Queensland Red Cross, which are providing medical care, running evacuation centres and helping people recover from the disaster.

Rio Tinto Chief Executive, Australia, Kellie Parker said: “Our hearts go out to everyone in the communities affected by the devastating floods, who include our team members and local suppliers and partners.

“We’re grateful for the extraordinary efforts of the Queensland Red Cross and the Queensland Royal Flying Doctors and hope this contribution helps them continue to provide much-needed support to those in crisis.

“North Queenslanders have shown incredible resilience, and these organisations are making a real difference for those in need.”

To further assist, Rio Tinto will match any employee donations to flood relief efforts.

The donation is part of Rio Tinto’s disaster relief program, which provides support in times of need to communities where the company operates.
