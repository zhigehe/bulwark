**DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:**The complaint alleges that, in the registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with BioAge's IPO, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors concerning BioAge's STRIDES Phase 2 trial for azelaprag. Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose: (1) the potential for liver transaminitis in any of its previous clinical STRIDES Phase 1 trials and various preclinical tox studies; (2) that there were no safety concerns and that BioAge expected top line results and to meet its primary endpoint goals in connection with its STRIDES clinical trial; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about the company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:**BioAge investors may, ***no later than March 10, 2025,*** seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through [Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357300-1&h=2133945715&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ktmc.com%2Fnew-cases%2Fbioage-labs-inc%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dbioa%26mktm%3Dr&a=Kessler+Topaz+Meltzer+%26+Check%2C+LLP) or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
