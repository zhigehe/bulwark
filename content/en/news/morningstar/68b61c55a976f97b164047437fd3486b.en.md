**Juniper Networks Brings Next Era of Sustainable AI-Native Innovation to Wired and Wireless Access**

*New EX4000 Series Switches driven by Mist AI maximize uptime, enable Zero Trust security and deliver the performance and scale needed for Wi-Fi 7 for the broadest range of organizational size and budget*

[Juniper Networks](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniper.net%2F&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Juniper+Networks&index=1&md5=a56814eb025e4bd15d623e253e00f5b2), (NYSE: JNPR), a leader in secure, AI-Native Networking, today announced new additions to its leading wired access portfolio that enable companies of all sizes to scale their IT operations, proactively mitigate risks and successfully facilitate strategic digital transformation initiatives. Designed from the ground up to sustainably support modern wired and wireless access needs, the new [Juniper Networks® EX4000 Series Switches](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniper.net%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fswitches%2Fex-series%2Fex4000-ethernet-switch.html%3Futm_medium%3Dwebsite_net%26utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DGLBL_CB_2025_Launch_EX4000%2520_25Q1&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Juniper+Networks%26%23174%3B+EX4000+Series+Switches&index=2&md5=2af351d5f3762379c49d971524d7cda0) leverage a groundbreaking AI- and cloud-native architecture to deliver exceptional Day 0, 1, and 2+ wired/wireless experiences, including fast deployment, maximized uptime, Zero Trust security, reduced operational costs, and seamless migration to Wi-Fi 7.

The EX4000 Series expands the reach of AI-Native operations with various form factors offered at compelling price points, including several noiseless models. This enables more enterprise locations, like stores, clinics, campuses and branch offices, to experience the unique benefits of AI for Networking, which have been proven to deliver up to 85 percent lower OPEX, 90 percent fewer network trouble tickets, and 85 percent fewer truck rolls for onsite troubleshooting.

**Fast deployment and configuration with Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and automation.** Juniper leverages ZTP for hands-free configuration of EX Switches, powered by flexible configuration templates that enable hundreds to thousands of switches to be deployed rapidly at scale with minimal errors. The [Mist AI™ mobile application](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fmistai%2Fid1215196902%3Futm_medium%3Dwebsite_net%26utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DGLBL_CB_2025_Launch_EX4000%2520_25Q1&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Mist+AI%26%238482%3B+mobile+application&index=3&md5=566d7b865bbe5f6a2c3443dc93acd749) further accelerates installation by enabling IT staff to simply scan QR codes to claim, name and assign switches to sites in a matter of minutes.

**Simplified operations with Mist AI.** The EX Series Switches support all the AIOps capabilities inherent in the Mist AI portfolio. This includes the Marvis® Virtual Network Assistant with conversational capabilities, self-driving operations and digital experience twinning with Marvis Minis to proactively identify and resolve issues. Additionally, dynamic packet capture (dPCAP) rapidly discovers and resolves certain wired/wireless problems without unnecessary truck rolls. Customizable service levels with automated workflows find and fix problems quickly.

**Maximized uptime with perpetual Power over Ethernet (PPoE) and rapid boot times.** The EX4000 Series offers PPoE across all ports, providing uninterrupted power delivery to Wi-Fi 7 access points, IoT devices and other mission-critical systems. The EX4000 Switches have exceptionally fast boot times, powering up in just minutes, accelerating enterprise-wide rollouts and providing fast recovery from outages or other failures. The micro services architecture inherent in the Juniper Mist™ cloud also supports the fast and frequent rollout of new features without planned service disruptions, enhancing the agility and resiliency of wired/wireless operations.

**Cost-effective, scalable connectivity purpose-built for Wi-Fi 7.** The EX4000 Series has options for 12-, 24-, or 48-port multigigabit connectivity, 802.3bt POE++ (up to 60W) as well as an innovative virtual chassis design that avoids expensive rewiring as customers add next-generation devices to their networks. This makes the platform ideal for high density environments, with seamless migration to Wi–Fi 7. When coupled with [Juniper® AP47 High-Performance Access Points](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniper.net%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Faccess-points%2Fap47-access-point.html%3Futm_medium%3Dwebsite_net%26utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DGLBL_CB_2025_Launch_EX4000%2520_25Q1&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Juniper%26%23174%3B+AP47+High-Performance+Access+Points&index=4&md5=505c1ed99ea2673802f9f5c6ee842a46) and Mist AI, customers can leverage the full potential of Wi-Fi 7 while enabling a cost-effective transition to the latest wireless technology.

**Inherent Zero Trust security.** [Juniper Mist Access Assurance](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniper.net%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fcloud-services%2Faccess-assurance.html%3Futm_medium%3Dwebsite_net%26utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DGLBL_CB_2025_Launch_EX4000%2520_25Q1&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Juniper+Mist+Access+Assurance&index=5&md5=5dd20e8adeba1ced65ad473b577e13fe) can be used with the new EX4000 to provide “always-on” identification, authentication and authorization for every device at every point of connection, verifying that only trusted users and devices access the network. By automating policy enforcement and access validation, Access Assurance avoids the operational complexity traditionally associated with Zero Trust architectures, making it easier to implement a Zero Trust architecture at scale in more locations.

**Energy efficient to meet global sustainability goals.** The EX4000 Series incorporates energy-efficient features such as intelligent fan speed adjustments and automatic PoE deactivation when ports are unused, empowering organizations to meet their environmental objectives whilst optimizing network efficiency.

**Accelerated outcomes with AI Advanced Care Professional Services.** [Juniper AI Advanced Care Professional Services](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniper.net%2Fus%2Fen%2Fservices%2Fjuniper-ai-advanced-care-services-datasheet.html%3Futm_medium%3Dwebsite_net%26utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DGLBL_CB_2025_Launch_EX4000%2520_25Q1&esheet=54204522&newsitemid=20250212028570&lan=en-US&anchor=Juniper+AI+Advanced+Care+Professional+Services&index=6&md5=66a54614a7d439384f80a05cec34e755) allow EX4000 Series customers to accelerate design, deployment and operations including seamless migrations from other vendors’ solutions.
