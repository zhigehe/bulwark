*“Cain International's expertise in helping businesses in recreational and leisure sectors to grow, and their focus on delivering long-term benefits, made them an ideal partner for us,” said Nottinghamshire Chair Andy Hunt.*

*"The Hundred has been an undoubted success in Nottingham - welcoming a diverse audience, attracting some of the world's best players and delivering an experience for supporters that is unrivalled on these shores.*

*"This investment, alongside those in other competing teams, will both help to safeguard the future of our 18-county system and elevate The Hundred to ensure it is able to thrive as one of the finest competitions of its kind worldwide.”*
