**HELP USA’s Art of Resilience Benefit Raises Awareness and Support for Arts-Based Healing, Announces Expansion into Music Therapy**

HELP USA, a national leader in homeless services and supportive housing, hosted its third annual Art of Resilience Benefit on February 7, 2025, bringing together artists, philanthropists, and advocates to celebrate the healing power of creative expression. Held at the National Arts Club, the event raised critical support for HELP USA’s art therapy program, which provides a creative outlet for homeless individuals living in HELP USA shelters across New York City.

During the evening, HELP USA announced an expansion of the Art of Resilience program to include music therapy, made possible by a Michael Bolton Charities (MBC) grant. To be implemented in HELP USA shelters, it will offer residents a new tool for emotional healing and self-expression. The announcement was made by MBC President Gale Sitomer, who emphasized the organization’s commitment to supporting survivors of domestic violence.

**"MBC is honored to launch the ‘Michael Bolton Music Therapy Program’ at HELP USA. For over 30 years, we’ve supported survivors of domestic violence. Music therapy provides coping skills for healing and hope, and we are proud to continue Michael’s legacy by bringing this resource to those most in need."**

HELP USA President and CEO Dan Lehman underscored the impact of integrating music therapy into HELP’s trauma-informed care model for homeless individuals.

**"Art therapy has already transformed lives in our shelters, and music therapy will expand our ability to support healing through creative expression. These programs help individuals process trauma, rebuild confidence, and regain stability on their journey to permanent housing.** **We are grateful to Michael Bolton Charities for making this possible."**

The event was hosted by Shantell Martin, the 2025 Art of Resilience Artist, who spoke about the inspiration behind her commissioned work for HELP Women’s Center, a transitional housing residence for women opening this fall in East New York, Brooklyn. She also led a meditative art-making experience – which had guests smiling and laughing together. Guided by Martin, they explored their inner artist, experiencing the creative process first-hand.

**"Art has the power to connect, build community, and inspire change. It sparks conversations, brings people together, and creates a sense of belonging. That’s why I’m excited to collaborate with HELP USA, an organization that empowers individuals and families working toward a brighter future. This project reminds us that strength comes from unity and that incredible things happen when we come together with purpose.”**

**Dr. Kathryn Beal, Atenedoro Gonzalez, Christina Senia, and Eden Williams** chaired the benefit. Guests included **Baseera Khan, the 2024 Art of Resilience Artist**, **Bernard Jackson**, **HELP Board Chair Anthony Williams** and **Debra Bates**, **Board Member Jeffrey Sachs**, **Liz Cohen Hausman and Jim Hausman**, **Tanya Rivero, Mariana Verkerk,** **Timo Weiland**, **Sterling McDavid, Addavail Coslett, Alexander Hankin, Yolanda Jimenez, and Demetria and Greg Bauso, Joseph Kohl-Riggs, Rick Gropper, Karen Hu, Sybil St. Germain, Senecca White, Natalia Tchetchoulina, Danelya Zholdasbekova, London Clark, Lena Lim, Gayle and Dave Simoes, and Fred Mwangaguhunga**, and others.
