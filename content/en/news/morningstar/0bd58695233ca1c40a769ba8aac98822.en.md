REDMOND, Wash., Feb. 10, 2025


REDMOND, Wash., Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- [Lumotive](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358403-1&h=1940784243&u=https%3A%2F%2Flumotive.com%2F&a=Lumotive), a leader in programmable optical semiconductor technology, has formed a strategic partnership with E-Photonics to spearhead advanced manufacturing of LiDAR and 3D sensing technologies in Saudi Arabia. This announcement was made at LEAP 2025 in Riyadh, one of the world's major technology events that brings together global innovators, industry leaders, and investors to highlight cutting-edge technologies and foster digital transformation across the region. This collaboration marks a pivotal advancement for LiDAR technology development in Saudi Arabia.

E-Photonics will leverage Lumotive's breakthrough Light Control Metasurface (LCM™) technology to develop and manufacture next-generation 3D sensing solutions for robotics, drones, and smart infrastructure applications. This collaboration aligns with Saudi Vision 2030's goals for technological advancement and industrial development, establishing a new hub for advanced technology manufacturing in the Kingdom.

E-Photonics is set to introduce two premium LiDAR products that utilize Lumotive's solid-state beam steering technology. The L30 boasts a 25-meter range and a frame rate of 10 Hz, making it ideal for applications such as pick-and-place robotics and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In contrast, the L42 expands its reach to 80 meters with a 20 Hz frame rate, aiming at outdoor use cases, including security systems and smart transportation initiatives. Both products incorporate Lumotive's software-defined scanning technology, which allows for dynamic performance enhancement, real-time adjustments of parameters, and improved functionality in demanding environments.

"This partnership represents a transformative step in bringing cutting-edge 3D sensing technology manufacturing to Saudi Arabia," said Mohammad Alghaith, CEO of E-Photonics. "Our collaboration with Lumotive perfectly exemplifies our commitment to Saudi Vision 2030, bringing advanced technology capabilities that will create significant value and advance our region's technological infrastructure."

"Our partnership with E-Photonics marks an exciting expansion of Lumotive's technology into new markets," said Dr. Sam Heidari, CEO of Lumotive. "This collaboration will accelerate the adoption of our LCM™ technology while supporting Saudi Arabia's vision for technological advancement. We're proud to contribute to the Kingdom's growing technology ecosystem through local manufacturing and innovation."
