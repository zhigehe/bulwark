The head of the European Commission said U.S. President Trump's decision to slap tariffs on European Union exports of steel and aluminum would result in countermeasures.

Trump said on Monday he would impose 25% tariffs on foreign metals imported to the U.S.

"Unjustified tariffs on the European Union will not go unanswered--they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures," Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Tuesday. The EU will safeguard its interests and protect its industry in response, she said.

"Tariffs are taxes--bad for business, worse for consumers," she said.
