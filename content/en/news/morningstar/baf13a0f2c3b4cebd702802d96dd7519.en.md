In December, more than 3,000 fans rolled through Taco Bell's Live Más Drive-Thru Cams, a first-of-its-kind photobooth experience capturing bestie Baja Blast runs, sonogram reveals, and guitar solos for an opportunity to appear in the 30-second Big Game commercial upending the usual celebrity-filled playbook.

"Big Game commercials tend to only lean on big-name celebrities, but we decided to flip the approach knowing very well the best Taco Bell moments don't need a script," said Taylor Montgomery, Chief Marketing Officer at Taco Bell. "Our fans bring incredible Live Más spirit to the drive-thru every day, with families, pets, and celebrations in tow, so we're putting them in the spotlight as a reminder that the most authentic representation of our brand isn't staged—it's lived."

**Taco Bell's Biggest Stars—The Fans—Stole the Show**Taco Bell's drive-thru scene was made for the big screen as fans from all walks of life showed up for the big game opportunity. In Cleveland, one couple decided to turn their Taco Bell drive-thru visit into an unforgettable pregnancy announcement featuring their sonogram, while another couple turned their Live Más Drive-Thru Cam experience into their wedding anniversary photoshoot. In Los Angeles, parents marked their 1-month-old's first drive-thru visit with a Mexican Pizza, while in Cookeville a superfan proved his Taco Bell fandom by double fisting Baja Blasts\*.

What began as a simple craving turned into a nationwide celebration and on Sunday night, hundreds of these Taco Bell fans across the nation shared a once-in-a-lifetime moment bringing total strangers together as they watched their Live Más Drive-Thru Cam moments unfold on the biggest stage for the first time.

**When Fans Take the Spotlight, Celebrities Take the Sidelines**[LeBron James](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358155-1&h=73226609&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FDEYCjxkzEn9%2F&a=LeBron+James) and [Doja Cat](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358155-1&h=2205100338&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40dojacat%2Fvideo%2F7444541987442691370%3Flang%3Den&a=Doja+Cat) made surprise cameos in the Big Game ad to express their disappointment at being upstaged by everyday fans who brought the Live Más spirit to millions watching live. The spot builds on a series of [playful attempts by the two Taco Bell fans](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358155-1&h=392058078&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40dojacat%2Fvideo%2F7463914106160942378&a=playful+attempts+by+the+two+Taco+Bell+fans) to join the action after learning that real fans would take center stage. In last month's lead-up [teaser](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358155-1&h=1385026585&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DB0O_LeuKTJU&a=teaser), Doja Cat hilariously photobombed fans, trying to sneak her way into the final cut.

"I'm not just here for the hype—I've always been a real Taco Bell fan, even when the cameras aren't rolling," said Doja Cat. "So yes, I've called them out to bring back my favorite menu item, and for not making me the star of the Big Game ad. But at the end of the day, that's what real fans do—we're passionate and we make Taco Bell, Taco Bell. I'm just glad that I can still have my Mexican Pizza."

Taco Bell fans LeBron and Doja Cat ultimately make cameos in a vibrant montage of passionate fans from all corners of the country, bringing their energy to Taco Bell's Live Más Drive-Thru Cams, which opened in five U.S. cities for a limited time in December.

"I've been a fan of Taco Bell for a long time, but playing a part in this level of fandom has been crazy and a lot of fun," said LeBron James. "This time it's about bringing ALL fans, the real MVPs, off the sidelines and into the game where we all belong—and that's what Taco Bell has always been about."

**Extending The Fan Fun Post-Game**Anyone who misses the premiere of the ad spot or wishes they could have been featured will have more ways to relive the fun on social media platforms. A first-of-its-kind partnership with TikTok, Taco Bell will be releasing a unique TopView filter post-game allowing fans to insert themselves into the spot and show off their true fandom.

**About Doja Cat**GRAMMY award-winning global superstar Doja Cat made her first upload to Soundcloud in 2013 at just 16 years old. Having grown up in and around the LA area, she developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Signed to Kemosabe/RCA Records in 2014, she released her Purrr! EP and followed that with her debut album Amala in spring 2018, but it was her August 2018 release of "MOOO!" which catapulted her into the mainstream and was met with critical acclaim.

Doja Cat released her sophomore GRAMMY-nominated platinum album Hot Pink in November 2019 to mass critical acclaim; the album has garnered 7 billion streams worldwide. It features "Streets", the viral sensation that soundtracked the 'Silhouette Challenge,' one of the biggest TikTok trends to date, and her GRAMMY-nominated #1 smash record "Say So" which has been RIAA certified 6x platinum and catapulted Doja Cat into global superstardom.

With over 33 billion worldwide streams to date, Doja Cat's creativity and showmanship as a performer have been praised time and time again, she has delivered unique and show-stopping performances on nearly all the major Award Show stages and music festivals throughout the world. Doja Cat's GRAMMY award-winning album Planet Her came out in June 2021 and dominated the charts, debuting at #1 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart and #2 on the Billboard Top 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and generated the highest first day Spotify streams for an album by a female rapper. GRAMMY award-winning "Kiss Me More" ft. SZA, the lead single off Planet Her is certified 5x platinum by the RIAA and hit #1 at Top 40 and Rhythm radio with over 2.5 billion streams worldwide. That fall, Doja Cat became the first rapper to have 3 songs in the Top 10 at Top 40 radio. Her hit track "Woman" went to the top of the Billboard Rhythmic Airplay charts which ascended her to become the first woman to have four #1 hits from one album, other hits including "You Right" with The Weeknd and "Need to Know." She went on to land at #1 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart for the first time. Amongst others, Doja Cat has won 5 AMAs, 5 Billboard Music Awards, 5 MTV VMAs, 3 BMI Awards, 2 MTV EMAs, 1 GRAMMY Award, and 1 NAACP Image Award along with garnering a total of 19 GRAMMY Award nominations. Additionally, Doja Cat has been nominated for 20 Billboard Music Awards, 18 MTV VMAs, 9 AMAs, 10 BET Awards, 8 MTV EMAs, 5 BMI Awards, and dozens more. Doja Cat was named one of TIME100's Most Influential People of 2023, where she was featured on the April 2023 cover issue and performed at the TIME100 Gala in New York City.

In September 2023, Doja Cat released her fourth studio album, Scarlet, which has been RIAA certified platinum and features smash hits "Agora Hills" (RIAA certified 2x platinum) and "Paint The Town Red" (RIAA certified 4x platinum). After releasing Scarlet, Doja Cat went on her first-ever North American headline tour, The Scarlet Tour. In April 2024, Doja Cat released her latest deluxe album, Scarlet 2 CLAUDE.
