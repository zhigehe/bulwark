JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) today began celebrating its 25th birthday, marking a quarter-century since its first customer flight took off on February 11, 2000 – ushering in a new era of affordable, customer-focused air travel that would set new standards for customer service in the years to come.

Two and a half decades later, the airline’s first flight – from New York’s JFK Airport to Fort Lauderdale – still operates today as JetBlue flight #1, a fitting tribute to JetBlue’s innovation, award-winning service, and mission of bringing humanity back to the skies.

“As we celebrate 25 groundbreaking years of JetBlue, I’m filled with gratitude and pride for the remarkable journey we’ve taken together,” said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s chief executive officer. “Our mission of bringing humanity back to air travel has set us apart, and our amazing crewmembers are redefining what it means to truly care for our customers and each other.”

Today’s celebrations were marked with festivities, giveaways, a birthday sale, and the debut of a new, special aircraft livery recognizing and celebrating JetBlue’s crewmembers who have been at the heart of the airline’s success for the past 25 years.

**A Historic Flight with a Brand-New Livery Dedicated to Crewmembers**

JetBlue today debuted its special *BlueUnity* livery, in tribute and recognition of the airline’s more than 23,000 dedicated crewmembers that make every flight possible. The freshly painted Airbus A321 aircraft operated today’s celebratory flight #1 from New York to Fort Lauderdale.

Born from heart and creativity, this one-of-a-kind livery was dreamed up by JetBlue crewmember Ray Mathew and brought to life as a tribute to the teamwork that keeps JetBlue soaring and its customers coming back. Every JetBlue workgroup plays a vital role in the travel journey, working together every day to allow customers to connect with loved ones, explore new destinations, and create memories. The aircraft also boasts eye-catching design elements, including a bold side-body tagline that says it all: 'Honoring the fly-est crew in the biz.'

“Building a unique culture focused on caring for the crewmembers was always core to the JetBlue model, and this new livery speaks to exactly that,” Geraghty said. “It’s truly awe-inspiring to think about the countless individuals, many working behind the scenes, who make our airline so special. Painting it on the side of a plane lets everyone in on the secret of JetBlue’s success—our crewmembers.”

Customers, crewmembers, and invited guests on board today’s birthday flight #1 were treated to surprises and giveaways at JetBlue’s Terminal 5. The celebrations kicked off earlier this morning in Buffalo to honor the airline’s first crewmember flight, which took off bound for JFK with guests and dignitaries on the same day back in 2000.

**JetForward: Building a Strong Future for Birthdays to Come**

Starting with just 10 destinations, JetBlue has spent the past 25 years working and growing into a much-loved and global airline that now serves over 100 destinations across 31 countries on three continents.

As an upstart airline, JetBlue has led the industry with feature after feature that made flying better – not only on JetBlue, but on the other airlines that have tried to follow JetBlue’s onboard innovations. From the industry’s first all-leather seating to the first seatback TVs with live entertainment, the first free unlimited high-speed Wi-Fi on every aircraft, and free name-brand snacks – the JetBlue Experience has been the envy of the U.S. airline industry. In 2014, JetBlue changed the game in the premium segment when it debuted Mint, with airlines scrambling to replicate JetBlue’s fresh take on premium that has since expanded across the U.S. and into the Caribbean, Canada, and Europe.

“Our combination of affordable air fares and award-winning service has given us a unique place in the industry as a bit of a maverick disruptor, and we are still building on that reputation,” Geraghty said. “The industry has changed a lot since 2000 and we’ve changed with it, but we’re continuing to put our customers at the center of our plan for the next chapter of JetBlue.”

Through its JetForward strategy, unveiled last year, JetBlue plans to strengthen its operational performance, launch new products and build out the best East Coast leisure network.

New and forthcoming customer experience enhancements include:

**European Expansion:** Launching seasonal routes from Boston to Madrid, Spain, and Edinburgh, Scotland, starting this May, which will join existing service to Dublin, Amsterdam, London and Paris.

**Cleared to Lounge:** First-ever customer lounges debuting at JFK’s Terminal 5 in 2025 and Boston Logan’s Terminal C soon after, offering perks for TrueBlue Mosaic® members and JetBlue premium cardholders**.**

**First-Class JetBlue-Style:** Introducing a domestic first-class option coming in 2026, combining elevated comfort with JetBlue’s signature low fares.

**Even More with EvenMore®:** An evolution of JetBlue’s beloved extra legroom seats in the front of the aircraft, EvenMore now gives customers additional amenities, including free alcoholic beverages, a premium snack, dedicated overhead bin space, early boarding, priority security and the extra space they know and love.

**Building Big in Boston:** With the most mainline service and the most nonstop destinations, JetBlue continues to strengthen its role as the top leisure airline in Boston, this year offering exciting new routes, including to Madrid and Edinburgh; expanding service to vacation hot spots in the Caribbean and Florida; and offering more of the airline's premium Mint experience.

**A220 Transition:** This year, JetBlue plans to officially retire its final E190 aircraft as it transitions to the modern Airbus A220 aircraft, which features added comfort, modern inflight connectivity and entertainment, as well as better fuel efficiency.
