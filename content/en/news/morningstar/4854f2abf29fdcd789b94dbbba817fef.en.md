NEW YORK, Feb. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --

[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598258/THE_ROSEN_LAW_FIRM_P_A_Logo.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598258/THE_ROSEN_LAW_FIRM_P_A_Logo.html)

Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: GO) between November 7, 2023 and May 7, 2024, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 31, 2025.

So what: If you purchased Grocery Outlet securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

What to do next: To join the Grocery Outlet class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=34369](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358171-1&h=2973869317&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34369&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34369) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 31, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Grocery Outlet's transition to new and upgraded systems; notably, that Grocery Outlet was either not truly equipped to timely and effectively execute on the transition or otherwise failed to disclose the potential for significant setbacks to Grocery Outlet's profitability as a result of delays and implementation issues which impacted Grocery Outlet's visibility and performance. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Grocery Outlet class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=34369](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358171-1&h=2973869317&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34369&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D34369) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
