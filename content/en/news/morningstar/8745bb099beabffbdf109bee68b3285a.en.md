CRN’s annual MSP 500 list is a comprehensive guide to the leading MSPs in North America. These companies deliver essential managed services that enhance business efficiency, simplify IT, and optimize return on technology investments for their customers. Within the MSP 500, the **Elite 150** category honors MSPs that offer a strategic blend of on- and off-premises services, catering primarily to midmarket and enterprise organizations.

Redesign stands among a select group of MSPs at the forefront of IT transformation, delivering cutting-edge solutions and forward-thinking strategies that drive operational efficiency, maximize ROI, and enhance overall business performance.

“The solution providers on our 2025 MSP 500 list deliver innovative managed services portfolios that enable clients of every size to be more agile and optimize their IT budgets as they grow their business,” said Jennifer Follett, VP of U.S. Content and executive Editor CRN, at The Channel Company. “These are the companies that anticipate client tech needs and develop groundbreaking services and solutions that let customers focus on their core business so they can accelerate success.”

“Being named to CRN's MSP 500 list in the Elite 150 category is a great honor and testament to our team’s relentless pursuit to reset the standard in customer experience,” said Phil Sanginario, CEO of Redesign. “Midmarket and enterprise organizations are looking for providers with a modern and flexible approach to Managed IT and Managed Security Services – we look forward to continue delivering on that promise.”

The MSP 500 list will be featured in the February 2025 issue of CRN Magazine and online at [www.crn.com/msp500](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CRN.com%2Fmsp500&esheet=54201307&newsitemid=20250211440002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.crn.com%2Fmsp500&index=4&md5=de48731754f02453846070a422814156) beginning February 10.
