Consumer companies were flat amid mixed earnings and rising inflation concerns.

The rate of U.S. consumer-price inflation rose to 3% in January, according to the latest Labor Department data.

Franco-Italian concern EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray Ban sunglasses and Supreme streetwear, posted sales growth ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Kraft Heinz shares fell after the consumer-products giant warned 2025 earnings would be shy of Wall Street benchmarks, as inflation once again threatens food processors' profits.

Ahold Delhaize, the Dutch owner of the Stop & Shop and Food Lion grocery-store chains, said U.S. sales and profitability fell in the key fourth quarter as the company sought to rein in prices to lure shoppers back to stores. Kroger hired veteran PepsiCo executive David Kennerley as the supermarket chain's chief financial officer as it steers through another period of rising food prices.
