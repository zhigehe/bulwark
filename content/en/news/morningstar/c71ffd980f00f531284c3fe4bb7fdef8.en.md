[**Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rgrdlaw.com%2Fcases-walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-class-action-wba.html&esheet=54201910&newsitemid=20250207350170&lan=en-US&anchor=Robbins+Geller+Rudman+%26amp%3B+Dowd+LLP&index=1&md5=8beb3e52fb5059eb0f0810f4c14587c3) announces that purchasers or acquirers of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Captioned *Klein v. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.*, No. 25-cv-01058 (N.D.

**CASE ALLEGATIONS**: Walgreens operates as a healthcare, pharmacy, and retail company.

The *Walgreens* class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) contrary to Walgreens’ purported commitment to improved regulatory compliance, Walgreens continued to engage in widespread violations of federal law governing the dispensation of prescription medication and reimbursement for the same; (ii) the foregoing conduct, when revealed, would subject Walgreens to a heightened risk of further regulatory scrutiny, civil liability, and reputational harm; and (iii) Walgreens’ revenues from the sale of prescription medications were unsustainable to the extent that they derived from unlawful conduct.

The *Walgreens* class action lawsuit further alleges that on January 17, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the filing of a civil complaint alleging that Walgreens “dispensed millions of unlawful prescriptions in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and then sought reimbursement for many of these prescriptions from various federal health care programs in violation the False Claims Act (FCA).” On this news, the price of Walgreens stock fell more than 12% over two trading sessions, according to the complaint.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS**: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Walgreens common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the *Walgreens* class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the *Walgreens* class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the *Walgreens* class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the *Walgreens* class action lawsuit.
