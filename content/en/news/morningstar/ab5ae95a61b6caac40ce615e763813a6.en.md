NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

**WHY:** Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Edison International (NYSE: EIX) between February 25, 2021 and February 6, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court **no later than April 14, 2025** in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.

**SO WHAT:** If you purchased Edison securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

**WHAT TO DO NEXT:** To join the Edison class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=33590](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8xhGEtxPYPM2n8ecAku2e8U2wWH284boNws8PO1Ms6px-7WPINKndEWRehemZnwwSA_LOUfl1_JpmxpfINvJZJIbhcs3iGjZR7nFzRcaUg1SRTLY1GXv-6kWbHx-GGLDBWbzH6Dp_KSPiW9Yjo86xYBMmAGAvugVI6VYMDzS7EE=) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jSt7N6Y5CqogvIdH_c8qlxwZZAwDQJ5KHPaL5ZKBIm0-1UFM-o-Jz4ri1eR6_0zmNq86xXngq-jS4paivXVBa6yb6UPncvIbTm0YCJMEJEM=) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court **no later than April 14, 2025.** A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

**WHY ROSEN LAW:** We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

**DETAILS OF THE CASE:** According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Edison’s claim that Southern California Edison Company (“SCE”) used its Public Safety Power Shutoffs (“PSPS”) program to “proactively de-energize power lines to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events”, was false; (2) this resulted in heightened fire risk in California and heightened legal exposure to Edison; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about Edison’s business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
