**Safety is Rio Tinto’s priority as Tropical Cyclone Zelia intensifies**

Rio Tinto is prioritising the safety of its people as Tropical Cyclone Zelia heads toward the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

Tropical Cyclone Zelia has intensified to a Category 5 system, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting it will cross the coast between Port Hedland and Karratha on Friday, local time.

Cape Lambert and Dampier Ports have been cleared and there are no longer any ships or trains operating at our ports.

Dampier Salt operations at Port Hedland and Dampier are also closed.

It is too early to say how long port and rail operations will be closed and what the impact will be.

As stated on 24 January 2025 in Rio Tinto’s [update](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.riotinto.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Freleases%2F2025%2Frio-tinto-provides-iron-ore-update-following-tropical-cyclone-sean&esheet=54205862&newsitemid=20250212741653&lan=en-US&anchor=update&index=1&md5=c2cb1f0d6e8cf79d1c19190a0fb98acf) on the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Sean, and subsequent closures from Tropical Cyclone Taliah and Tropical Cyclone Vince, first-quarter shipments will be affected by weather events.

Shipment guidance for 2025 remains unchanged.

The company is working to mitigate impacts and will provide operational updates as appropriate.
