While Cancún and London remain popular for spring breakers, data shows travelers are also eyeing spring trips to less typical spots like Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok and Seoul.2

Regardless of destination, if last year’s trend holds spring travelers can save up to 25% on airfare by booking three to four weeks in advance of travel and avoiding peak travel dates.3 For travelers planning around school breaks in March, that sweet spot ends around Valentine’s Day.3

* Spring is a great time to travel, and it’s also the best time to [book a cruise](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fswift%2Fcruise%3Fsiid%3D1207601%26referrer%3Dff36e267-fcc6-439b-8b39-6864b747b602%26lang%3D1%26destinations%3D9%2C1%2C7%2C24%2C15%26destinationtype%3DAll%26cruiseline%3D1%2C2%2C5%2C982%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C8807%26startdate%3D05%252F01%252F2025%26enddate%3D12%252F31%252F2025%26transportid%3D29%26sortcolumn%3DdepartureDate%26sortorder%3Dasc&esheet=54203670&newsitemid=20250211761138&lan=en-US&anchor=book+a+cruise&index=3&md5=88db5351224d1d55890e4bc3fdf0cee1). From now until March is “wave season,” the cruise industry’s version of Black Friday.

“There are two types of spring travelers: spring breakers and everyone else,” says Melanie Fish, head of Expedia Group brands public relations. “For the latter group, it’s easy to skip the peak dates and save on your airfare ticket. For those that are beholden to school schedules, you can still save hundreds of dollars just by bundling your flights and hotel on Expedia, especially when you’re headed to resort destinations like Mexico and Hawaii.”
