Expect months of negotiations after the Feb. 23 election

Germany is heading to the polls in what's likely to shift leadership in Europe's largest economy.

It's taking place in the context of a stagnating economy, with Germany hit by the twin blows of cheap Russian gas getting cut off as Chinese demand for German exports imploded. One widely tracked business indictor, the Ifo business climate index, is near its worst levels since the COVID pandemic first erupted.

The election for the 630-seat Bundestag is taking place on Sunday, Feb. 23. It's happening seven months early after a snap election was agreed. The first exit polls are due at 6 p.m. local time, or noon Eastern.

From there, unless a party wins an outright majority - which is very unlikely to happen - expect months of negotiations. Morgan Stanley's analysts expect a new government might take office in April at the earliest.

Germany has a complicated system: voters get two votes, one for the candidate in their own constituency, and another for a party's electoral list. There's also a minimum 5% threshold for a party to enter the parliament.

There's likely to be a new chancellor: Friedrich Merz, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union. Politico's poll of polls shows that the CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, on 30% of the vote.

In second place is the Elon Musk-supported anti-immigrant Alternative for Deutschland, on 22%. Merz has repeatedly pledged not to bring the AfD into his ruling coalition, though his party recently worked in the legislature on a migration bill with the AfD, drawing condemnation from the CDU's previous leader, Angela Merkel.

If Merz does reject the AfD, it would mean an alliance with either the left-center Social Democratic Party, currently headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, or the Green Party. Or, possibly, both. The Politico poll roundup has the SPD on 17% and the Greens on 13%.

Analysts at Citi calculated six different scenarios and the likely economic and market reaction to all of them.

In an alliance with the SPD, Citi's economists expect a modest loosening of Germany's strict debt brake rules, pro-industrial policies and a minimum wage increase. With the Greens, Citi's economists expect similar policies, but with more defense spending and more scope for labor law deregulation.

There is the very, very unlikely possibility of an outright AfD victory that would shock the world. In that case, expect a hugely negative reaction in the euro (EURUSD) - though of late the AfD has walked back its preference to exit the shared currency - the stock market to tank, and for the bond yields of periphery eurozone countries to widen significantly.

Also unlikely, but less so, would be an AfD-led coalition with the CDU as the minority party.

"We assume that similar to other countries, a cooperation between the center-right and the far right would prevent disruptive policies such as euro, EU and NATO exit. It would allow the implementation of a conservative economic agenda, in particular tax cuts, potentially boosting growth," said Citi's economists.

Ahead of the election, Germany's stock market has been booming, with the main DAX DX:DAX index up 11% this year and regularly registering record highs.

The MDAX XX:MDAX of more domestically-oriented companies has gained 7% this year.
