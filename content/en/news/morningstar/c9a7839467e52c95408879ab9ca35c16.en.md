*The pioneers of virtual 3D material sampling just secured $2M in seed funding to disrupt legacy models of visual discovery and product curation with an AI-native workflow called Design Stream.*

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- [Mattoboard](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=1562362447&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmattoboard.com%2F&a=Mattoboard), the 3D interior design platform streamlining product curation and reducing material waste through virtual sampling and advanced visual search, today announces $2M in seed funding led by [Acrobator Ventures](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=581222289&u=https%3A%2F%2Facrobator.vc%2F&a=Acrobator+Ventures), with participation from [Blue Field Capital](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=2204121326&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluefieldcap.com%2F&a=Blue+Field+Capital) and [SoundBoard](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=2698461743&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundboardventurefund.com%2F&a=SoundBoard). [Home Depot Ventures](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=2891829805&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.homedepot.com%2Fnews-releases%2F2022%2F05-03-2022-130203656&a=Home+Depot+Ventures) and [Masco](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=201193276&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmasco.com%2Fmascoventures%2F&a=Masco+) also joined the round, underscoring the growing demand for digital innovation in the architecture and interior design (A&D) industry. This latest investment brings the company's total funding to nearly $3M, enabling Mattoboard to equip designers and architects worldwide with advanced 3D material twins and AI-powered discovery tools that eliminate search inefficiencies, reduce waste, and transform the creative process of curation to specification.

Mattoboard equips designers & architects with advanced 3D material twins, eliminating the need for physical sampling.

Despite its immense scale and innovative nature, the $700B A&D industry has lagged in adopting modern tools that mirror its level of ingenuity. Designers often rely on a patchwork of platforms such as Canva for design, Pinterest for moodboarding, and Photoshop or 3D Renderers for visualization, leading to disjointed and inefficient workflows. Additionally, many firms still depend on physical material sampling, ordering swatches of paint, textiles, and other materials that often go unused. This practice not only contributes to the 92 million tons of waste generated annually by the textile industry but also imposes financial burdens on A&D professionals and suppliers alike.

"Architects and interior designers transform, rebuild, and reimagine the physical world around us. Yet, for small-scale projects, the design process is plagued by archaic and wasteful processes," said Zack Gordon, President of Masco Ventures. "Mattoboard is changing that by driving innovation, streamlining the creative process, and partnering with premier consumer brands such as Behr ® and Hansgrohe ® in a tech-forward platform for design professionals and DIYers."

Mattoboard's 3D, AI-equipped platform eliminates the outdated physical sampling process, enabling instantaneous material and product discovery and visualization in a few clicks. By digitizing the interior design studio, Mattoboard:

* **Transforms the creative process & visual search:** Designers can quickly find, experience, and assemble thousands of virtual materials and products. Users can also upload photos of their own products and immediately incorporate them into 3D boards.
* **Reduces waste**: The platform curbs unnecessary material production and shipping through interactive virtual sampling.
* **Leverages digital twins:** For designers, the photorealistic 3D board replicates the physical experience of mixing and matching products and materials. For suppliers, it decreases inventory and shipping costs.
* **Simulates real life:** Mattoboard captures how surfaces and textures reflect real-world light, shadow displacement, glossiness, reflections, transparency, metallicness, and textural depth.

The company already partners with leading A&D suppliers, including Behr, Formica, Jung, Karndean, Cortina, Anker, Bru Textiles, and more. Suppliers' sales and marketing teams use virtual samples across their organizations to create and share product mockups, concept boards, and sales content faster and with no physical waste. To date, more than 200,000 interior designers and architects have signed up to use Mattoboard's virtual 3D sampling platform, which attracts more than 10,000 sign-ups each month. The Pro tier of Mattoboard's platform has quickly drawn interest from more than 2,000 paying designers, including those from the top[100 global design firms](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359705-1&h=2271228346&u=https%3A%2F%2Finteriordesign.net%2Fresearch%2Finterior-designs-top-100-giants-2024%2F&a=100+global+design+firms).

In 2025, Mattoboard will enhance its platform with AI-enabled tools. A key addition will be Design Stream, an AI-native discovery and visualization co-pilot that lets every designer customize their own product discovery engine. An entirely new method for visual search, Design Stream will allow designers to quickly find specific products, refine the look and feel of their projects, and get recommendations for optimal materials based on project specifications. This is a win-win for both sides of the A&D marketplace: designers benefit from smooth visual search and more efficient workflows, while brands maximize product visibility at the exact moment designers seek them. Mattoboard plans to expand its material database significantly and announce new partnerships with global suppliers this year.

"As an architect and designer of more than 20 years, I've seen first-hand how little the physical sampling process has evolved, preventing professionals from effectively digitizing their workflows and exploring their full creative potential, and simultaneously bogging down the industry's sustainability efforts," said Guy Adam Ailion, Co-founder and CEO of Mattoboard. "From the designer browsing leather swatches to the paint supplier shipping samples to potential customers, Mattoboard is committed to optimizing workflows for every person in this industry with a virtual design studio that meets today's needs. This funding milestone gets us closer to bringing every material in the world online and evolving the interior design industry at large."
