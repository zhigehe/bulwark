***Electric Vehicle Technology, Innovation & Sustainability***

**OSCEOLA, AR / [ACCESS Newswire](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) / February 10, 2025 /** Envirotech Vehicles, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVTV), a leading provider of electric commercial vehicles, acknowledges the recent policy changes under the Trump administration concerning the **Green New Deal, electric vehicle mandates, and the $7,500 consumer vehicle credit.** While these developments primarily impact the consumer EV market, EVTV remains confident in the **robust growth potential of electric commercial vans, trucks, and school buses.**

**Strategic Alignment with American Manufacturing Initiatives**

**President and CFO Jason Maddox** emphasized EVTV's strategy to align with the Trump Administration's focus on **strengthening U.S. manufacturing** and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains:

"With over two decades in the defense contracting sector, I've witnessed firsthand the importance of building a strong American industrial base. At Envirotech, we are fully committed to producing **American-made vehicles,** supporting **domestic manufacturing,** and **creating jobs for American workers.** This approach not only aligns with the Trump Administration's priorities but ensures that Envirotech remain resilient in the face of global trade tensions and supply chain disruptions."

**Advantages of Electric Commercial Vehicles**

Electric commercial vehicles offer significant advantages over gasoline or diesel-powered fleets, particularly in terms of **return on investment (ROI), operational savings, and sustainability incentives.**

**1. EPA's Clean School Bus Program and Emission Reductions**

Envirotech's **electric school buses** qualify for federal funding under the **EPA's Clean School Bus Program,** which provides rebates and grants to replace aging diesel buses with zero-emission alternatives. Diesel school buses contribute significantly to **air pollution and respiratory issues** among children, particularly in urban and suburban school districts. The switch to EV school buses not only benefits student health but also **reduces operating costs** for school districts.

* **Lower Maintenance & Fuel Savings -** EV school buses reduce fuel and maintenance costs by up to **50% compared to diesel buses.**
* **Improved Air Quality in Schools & Communities -** Eliminating diesel exhaust helps reduce **asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory conditions** in school-aged children.

**2. Carbon Credit Capture & Emission Reduction Incentives**

Envirotech's vehicles contribute to **carbon credit programs** that allow fleet operators and businesses to earn credits by reducing COâ‚‚ emissions. These **credits can be sold or traded,** creating an additional revenue stream for fleet operators. Cities adopting low-emission zones and **corporate ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) mandates** are increasingly investing in electric commercial vehicles to meet **carbon neutrality goals.**

**3. Strong Economic Benefits for Logistics Fleets**

With the continued expansion of e-commerce, the demand for **first-mile and last-mile delivery vehicles** has skyrocketed. Logistics companies, **including Amazon, Walmart.com, and third-party logistics providers (VSPs),** are outsourcing delivery routes to **small fleet operators.** Envirotech's electric **vans and trucks** are designed to **meet the needs of these growing logistics providers** by offering:

* **Lower cost per mile** than gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles.
* **Predictable and reduced fuel costs,** given fluctuating gas prices.
* **Overnight charging convenience** at fleet depots, ensuring vehicles are fully charged and ready for daily routes.

**4. Higher ROI vs. Consumer EVs**

While consumer electric vehicles rely heavily on government tax credits and mandates, **commercial electric vehicles** offer a **much higher return on investment** due to commercial vehicle's **heavier fuel consumption and long daily routes.** Commercial EVs provide:

* **Immediate cost savings on fuel & maintenance** compared to diesel trucks and buses.
* **Long-term financial incentives** through carbon credits and reduced operational costs.
* **Greater market stability,** as fleet buyers are less dependent on consumer incentives.

**Positioned for Success in Today's Political Climate**

Envirotech's focus on **domestic manufacturing** and **job creation** aligns seamlessly with the Trump Administration's push for **"Made in America" manufacturing policies.** As trade wars and tariffs continue to impact imports from **China, Canada, and Mexico,** Envirotech is **prioritizing U.S. based assembly and production facilities** to:

* **Reduce exposure to global supply chain disruptions** and tariff-related price increases.
* **Create high-paying American jobs** and strengthen the national workforce.
* **Align with federal policies favoring U.S. manufacturing and job creation.**

"As a defense contractor, I've spent my career helping to build the American industrial base," added Jason Maddox. "With Envirotech, we are committed to **hiring American workers, investing in American innovation, and securing a future for electric transportation that benefits both businesses and communities."**

**Investor Confidence & Market Outlook**

Despite shifting federal policies impacting the **consumer EV sector, commercial electric vehicles remain one of the fastest-growing segments** in transportation. Envirotech is **well-positioned** to benefit from:

* **Surging demand in e-commerce logistics fleets and last-mile delivery networks.**
* **School districts transitioning to electric buses under EPA & state initiatives.**
* **Corporate and municipal carbon reduction commitments** supporting electric fleets.
* **Government incentives for U.S. manufacturing, which bolster American-made vehicle production.**

Envirotech's **business model is resilient,** designed to thrive in **any political or economic environment** by focusing on commercial fleet solutions that **generate real cost savings and operational efficiencies.** The company is actively working on **new partnerships and fleet integrations** to expand its market share.
