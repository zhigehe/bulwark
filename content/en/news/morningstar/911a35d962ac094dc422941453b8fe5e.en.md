**Record-Breaking Survey: Flirting with Bots, Fake Matches and More**

* **Flirting with chatbots:** More than a quarter of respondents (26%) admitted to flirting with a chatbot or AI, either for fun or unknowingly.
* **Suspicion of fake matches:** 60% of participants have either suspected or discovered that someone they matched with was a bot or AI.
* **Phishing and bot interactions:** 21% of respondents say they’ve experienced phishing attempts, 10% say they’ve interacted with bots and 15% say they’ve encountered both phishing and bots.
* **Desire for human verification:** A significant 90% of respondents indicated they would prefer dating apps to include a verification system to confirm that users are real humans.
* **Lack of confidence in user verification:** Two-thirds of respondents (66%) believe dating apps don’t take adequate measures to verify real humans.
* **Concern about bots and fake profiles:** 61% of respondents say they’re concerned about encountering bots or fake profiles on dating apps.

“It’s no secret that, for many singles, dating apps such as Bumble, Hinge and Tinder are the default place to look for love. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to know whether your match is, indeed, a real human,” said Tiago Sada, Chief Product Officer at [Tools for Humanity](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftoolsforhumanity.com&esheet=54205858&newsitemid=20250213327587&lan=en-US&anchor=Tools+for+Humanity&index=3&md5=7bd8bdb06549db0d0f486c2d05efad3d), a contributor to World. “With catfishing and unwanted bot interactions on dating apps gaining prevalence, we need tools that take away the guesswork, so people can keep matching, dating and finding love without worry or deception.”

"The challenge with bots and artificial intelligence is not just technical; it’s something deeper. It affects our emotional well-being,” said [Mariana Kerz](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Flic.marianakersz%2Fp%2FC6UJ5iHLojr%2F&esheet=54205858&newsitemid=20250213327587&lan=en-US&anchor=Mariana+Kerz&index=4&md5=00f61062fb376bdc65a4fadb8c58f66d), a licensed couple’s therapist in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “Discovering that the person you thought you were talking to isn’t real can shatter any illusion and projection, leading to sadness and even more severe mental health issues, such as depression."
