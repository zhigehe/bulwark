NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- After Super Bowl MVP quarterback Jalen Hurts led his team to a stunning Super Bowl win Sunday night in New Orleans, there was only one thing left for him to do: Gaze triumphantly into the swarm of TV cameras and shout one of the most famous lines in sports â€“ "I'm Going to Disney World!''

It was a celebratory scene as the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback stood victorious on the field at the Caesars Superdome amid a sea of confetti and cheering fans, a storybook moment captured by Disney's camera crews for Disney's iconic Super Bowl commercial airing nationally and on social media in Spanish, Portuguese and English.

The festive party now heads East to Walt Disney World Resort in Florida where Hurts will be the center of attention during a whirlwind day of Disney fun. There, he will experience everything from signature attractions to dazzling entertainment to popular Disney characters. And it culminates with Hurts leading a colorful parade down Main Street, U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom.

For Hurts's visit, this marks the second time in recent years that an Eagles player has been a part of Disney's Super Bowl campaign, which began in 1987 when New York quarterback Phil Simms proclaimed he was going to Walt Disney World after the Giants' championship.

Hurts' efficient performance in Super Bowl LIX led the Eagles to a 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the season's biggest game of the year. He completed 17 of 22 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns, and added 72 rushing yards, setting a Super Bowl record for rushing yards by a quarterback. It was the ultimate comeback story for Hurts, who lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl two years ago.

Hurts joins some of the biggest names in Super Bowl history who have been part of the long-running Disney Super Bowl campaign which started in 1987 when Phil Simms shouted those famous words after the New York Giants won the Super Bowl.
