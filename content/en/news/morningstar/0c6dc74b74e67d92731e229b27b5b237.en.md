OTTAWA--The Bank of Canada on Tuesday appointed a University of Toronto economics professor as a second external deputy governor, bringing the membership on the central bank's governing council to seven.

Michelle Alexopoulos will serve in a part-time capacity for a two-year term, the central bank said. The bank created an external deputy governor position in 2023 to introduce new perspectives to the governing council, which is tasked with deciding on rate policy. Nicolas Vincent, a professor at HEC Montreal, was named the first external deputy governor in 2023, and has subsequently had his term extended for another three years.

The central bank said Alexopoulos's research focuses on the business cycle as well as the effects of technical change and uncertainty.
