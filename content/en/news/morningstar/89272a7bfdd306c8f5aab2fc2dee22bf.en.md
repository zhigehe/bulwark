**Evidently Hires Kai Romero, MD, as Head of Clinical Success**

*The cognitive AI platform expands its executive team following $15 million funding round*

[Evidently](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevidently.com%2F&esheet=54206228&newsitemid=20250213194182&lan=en-US&anchor=Evidently&index=1&md5=839ebbe6b70db87aa2a1c63cc4f7cd41), a clinical data intelligence platform, has tapped Kai Romero, MD, as its head of clinical success. This marks the first major hire since the organization closed its [$15 million Series A](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financial-news.co.uk%2Fhealthcare-ai-startup-evidently-closes-15m-series-a-to-revolutionize-healthcare-with-cognitive-ai%2F&esheet=54206228&newsitemid=20250213194182&lan=en-US&anchor=%2415+million+Series+A&index=2&md5=c93440d0b91f52ffd69970d90879efed) funding round in December 2024. Romero’s experience as chief medical officer at By the Bay Health and as an emergency medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente will help guide platform development, ensuring Evidently’s offerings support physicians and healthcare organizations by streamlining unwieldy and time-consuming documentation and summarization.

The average patient’s medical chart is thousands of pages, including both structured data within the EMR and unstructured data such as notes, faxes, referrals and claims. Founded in 2020, Evidently provides healthcare organizations with cognitive AI tools capable of quickly reading and summarizing this information, empowering providers with the most relevant insights to make clinical decisions quickly.

“Evidently goes beyond just summarizing what’s in the EMR. It gives providers an ‘AI resident’ that can do the lion’s share of data collection and present it in a way that’s most relevant for physicians. We leverage technology to keep humanity at the center of healthcare, letting providers focus on their patients,” said Kalie Dove-Maguire, MD, head of product at Evidently. “Dr. Romero joins our passionate team of doctors and engineers, acting as a guiding force to keep providers and their patients at the heart of our mission. This positions Evidently to better support our nation’s siloed and burned-out healthcare ecosystem.”

Unlike other AI offerings in the healthcare industry, Evidently provides an evidence-based approach to the platform, carefully citing every aspect of its clinical summary in the patient chart. Evidently’s platform informs providers of the patient’s most recent information as well as possible gaps in care, leaving the application of medical knowledge in the providers’ hands. The platform also enables faster coding and documentation across roles, and alerts organizations to potential coding mistakes or missed reimbursement opportunities.

“Everyone from providers to back-office staff is overwhelmed by the increasing pressures and expectations of a fragmented healthcare system, and all of these parties can benefit from intelligent, evidence-based technology,” said Feng Niu, founder and CEO at Evidently. “Dr. Romero is a brilliant addition to our team. Her experience as a practicing physician will help us better empower providers and expand Evidently’s use cases to ease the load across clinical, pharma and payer organizations.”

Evidently is currently deployed within healthcare organizations across the United States and has already uncovered millions of dollars in ROI, saved providers thousands of hours in data gathering and documentation, and improved patient care by enabling clinicians to focus more on direct patient interactions. In addition to expanding its team, Evidently will use its Series A funding to grow its platform as demand increases for its solutions.
