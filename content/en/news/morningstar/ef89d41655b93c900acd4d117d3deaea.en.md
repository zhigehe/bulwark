HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Halle Stanford, the Emmy Award®-winning longtime President of Television for The Jim Henson Company, is relaunching her company, 7 Crow Stories, as she embarks on an exciting new chapter in her career as an independent producer and writer. As part of this new venture, Stanford has signed a first-look producer deal with The Jim Henson Company, where she has worked as a producer and executive for the past 30 years.

Under her 7 Crow Stories banner, Stanford will develop a variety of live-action and animated projects for The Jim Henson Company for preschool, family, and primetime audiences, continuing to prioritize entertaining, impactful, and imaginative content across a wide range of genres. Some of these highly anticipated projects that have been previously announced include the primetime fantasy series *Goblins* with Norman Reedus, the primetime animated series *Lore Olympus*, based on Webtoon's highly popular digital comic series, and the older kids' animated series *Adrenaline Lemmings*. Stanford is also attached to develop a future production of the beloved and award-winning *Fraggle Rock*.

As an additional element of her new deal, Stanford will serve as creator, showrunner, and writer for multiple Jim Henson Company projects that she has personally created and written. Chief among these projects is the live-action puppet preschool series *Jim Henson's Wowsabout!*, which is slated to begin shooting in the summer of 2025.

*Jim Henson's Wowsabout!* is a live-action puppet comedy for preschoolers, co-created by Halle Stanford and Dorien Davies (*Word Party*, *Julie's Greenroom*). The series follows Roxy, a guitar-playing hedgehog, and Ronald, a tree-loving pig, as they embark on an adventure to discover the "Wows of the World." Exploring awe, they'll visit the California Redwoods, have a sleepover with the Declaration of Independence, tour art museums, and experience many more wonders! Davies and John Tartaglia (*Fraggle Rock*) will be Co-Executive Producers and perform as the puppeteers for Roxy and Ronald. The show has partnered with Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., from UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, to integrate their world-renowned awe-based curriculum.

Stanford said, "I've had the incredible privilege to stand next to the Dark Crystal, party down in Fraggle Rock, and now, I'm beyond excited to produce my dream show, *Jim Henson's Wowsabout!*, take flight with my company, 7 Crow Stories, and dedicate myself to creating series that inspire awe, action, and imagination. I'm deeply grateful for this new chapter with The Jim Henson Company as we continue to innovate family programming and collaborate with the very best dreamers in the world."

"Over her decades of work with The Jim Henson Company, Halle has brought to bear the positive influence that television can have on generations of children and has also dedicated herself to developing her own powerful, inspiring, and joyous creative voice," said Lisa Henson, CEO of The Jim Henson Company. "Through her collaborative producing, thoughtful writing, and dynamic leadership, she has built a strong scaffolding for herself as a showrunner for a raft of productions that reflect her deep understanding and mastery of children's television."

"Having Halle Stanford apply her talent and experience now as a producer and showrunner broadens our capabilities and strengthens our slate overall, as she will provide concentrated firepower and focus to some of our highest-priority projects," said Chris Lytton, COO and President of The Jim Henson Company.

Stanford will continue working closely with Lisa Henson, who will oversee the Creative Affairs team, including Tara Billik (Vice President of Feature Films), Delaney Shiokari (Director of Primetime Development), Tim O'Brien (Production Executive), John Tartaglia (Creative Supervisor for *Fraggle Rock*), as well as a yet-to-be-hired Vice President of Kids' Development. Brian Henson and Vince Raisa from Brian Henson Productions will also continue to develop a strong film and TV slate for The Jim Henson Company.

Halle Stanford recently executive produced *Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock*, which earned 10 Emmy® nominations for its second season, alongside nominations for a PGA Award, WGA Award, Environmental Media Award, and a GLAAD Media Award. Her other executive producer credits include *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* (Emmy®-winning), *Fraggle Rock: Rock On!*, *Slumberkins*, *Harriet the Spy* (Apple TV+), and PBS KIDS® series like *Sid the Science Kid*, *Dinosaur Train*, and *Splash and Bubbles*. She was also Executive Producer on *Julie's Greenroom* (Netflix), *Pajanimals* (Sprout), and *Word Party* (Netflix).
