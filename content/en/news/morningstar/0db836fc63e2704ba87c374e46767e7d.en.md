By Mike Murphy

President Donald Trump said Sunday he will announce 25% tariffs against all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. on Monday.

He added that he plans to announce a series of reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday. Trump said on Friday that reciprocal tariffs were forthcoming - potentially against imports from China, Japan, the European Union and Taiwan, among other countries that already impose tariffs against American goods.

"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Trump did not say when the new tariffs will take effect. He has already imposed additional 10% tariffs against goods made in China, and paused the imposition of 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico for a month.

Critics warn that tariffs could result in higher prices for American consumers, at a time when inflation has remained stubbornly high for years. Supporters of tariffs claim they will help reduce dependence on foreign imports and help revive American industry.

Stocks took a tumble on Friday as investors considered the effects of additional tariffs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA losing 444 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 SPX also fell 1% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP slid 1.4%.
