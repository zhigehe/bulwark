*Ad Populum Affiliate Named Winning Bidder for Intellectual Property* 

WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Party City Holdco Inc. ("PCHI" or the "Company") announced today that it successfully completed auctions of substantially all of its intellectual property and related wholesale operating intangible assets as well as a significant portion of its real estate lease portfolio. Together, these efforts to maximize value will generate substantial proceeds for the benefit of stakeholders in the Company's Chapter 11 proceedings.

Following robust bidding, New Amscan PC, LLC, an affiliate of Ad Populum, LLC, emerged as the winning bidder for the Party City brand and related Amscan operating assets. New Amscan's prevailing bid, which has a net value of $20 million comprised of $16 million in cash and additional consideration, represents twice the value of its "stalking horse" bid heading into the auction. As previously announced, Ad Populum intends to lead a transformation of the Party City and Amscan brands, leveraging its strengths in sourcing and distribution to preserve and build upon PCHI's legacy in the multibillion dollar party supply industry.

The Company's lease auction process resulted in approximately $14.5 million of gross proceeds, with the potential for additional value to be generated. Efforts to monetize remaining leases are continuing, and interested parties are encouraged to visit [https://www.agrep.com/index.php/partycity](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358448-1&h=1774911794&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agrep.com%2Findex.php%2Fpartycity&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agrep.com%2Findex.php%2Fpartycity) for more information on available sites.
