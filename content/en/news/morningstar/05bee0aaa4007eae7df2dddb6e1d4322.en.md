[Conduent Incorporated](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.conduent.com%2F&esheet=54201747&newsitemid=20250210806851&lan=en-US&anchor=Conduent+Incorporated&index=1&md5=4953e09fa6710995e1f168359e83eeaa) (Nasdaq: CNDT), a global technology-led business solutions and services company, today announced that the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) has selected the company’s [Maven® Disease Surveillance & Outbreak Management System](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.conduent.com%2Fgovernment-solutions%2Fmedicaid-public-health-solutions%2Fpublic-health-management-solutions%2F&esheet=54201747&newsitemid=20250210806851&lan=en-US&anchor=Maven%26%23174%3B+Disease+Surveillance+%26amp%3B+Outbreak+Management+System&index=2&md5=55aca663e97a489b6aa1fdfc9b8fa0a4) to replace a legacy public health surveillance system. The newly implemented cloud-based platform will enable OSDH to swiftly detect, monitor, track and report public health threats and infectious disease outbreaks, transforming data into actionable insights to protect Oklahomans.

“As the frontline agency safeguarding the health and wellbeing of all 4 million Oklahomans, our goal is to leverage modern technology solutions to identify outbreaks, manage cases and collaborate with local partners on public health interventions,” said Christie McDonald-Hamm, Surveillance Officer, Department of Informatics at OSDH. “Conduent’s secure and flexible AI-enabled technology platform equips us with the tools to identify, capture, share and report data to impacted individuals, the local healthcare community, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

Conduent’s Maven system, with over two decades of proven outcomes, is supported by a team of epidemiologists and is utilized across 28 government agencies in the United States, Europe and Australia to manage emerging threats to their residents. Conduent’s Maven system is a highly configurable, web-based platform that enables real-time monitoring and reporting to local, state and national public health organizations.

“We are excited to collaborate with the Oklahoma State Department of Health to support their mission of protecting and promoting the good health of people across the state,” said Anna Sever, President, Government Solutions at Conduent. “Our advanced, AI-enabled technology platform gives public health teams the transparency, security and responsiveness needed to stay ahead of disease outbreaks now and in the future.”

Organizations use Maven to detect, monitor, track and report on deadly outbreaks like COVID-19, C. auris and Mpox and more than 100 other communicable and non-communicable diseases including Ebola, Zika, measles, tuberculosis, HIV/STDs and influenza.
