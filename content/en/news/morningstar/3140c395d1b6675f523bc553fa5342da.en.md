WINNIPEG, Manitoba--The ICE Futures canola market saw a continuation of Thursday's rally on Friday, hitting its highest levels since November as tightening stocks and the need to ration demand provided support.

Statistics Canada reported canola stocks in the country as of Dec. 31 at 11.382 million tonnes, which compares with 14.087 million at the same time a year ago and marks the tightest level for this time of year since the drought year in 2021.

Weekly Canadian canola exports of 145,800 tonnes were down 29 per cent from the previous week, but year-to-date exports of 5.484 million tonnes were roughly double what moved by the same time in 2023-24.

Gains in Chicago soyoil and Malaysian palm oil provided underlying support, although soybeans and European rapeseed futures were weaker.

There were 67,509 contracts traded on Friday, which compares with Thursday when 66,363 contracts changed hands.

Spreading accounted for 49,868 of the contracts traded.
