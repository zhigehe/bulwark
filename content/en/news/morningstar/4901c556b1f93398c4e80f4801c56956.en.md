**KBRA Assigns Preliminary Ratings to BX 2025-ROIC**

KBRA announces the assignment of preliminary ratings to six classes of BX 2025-ROIC, a CMBS single-borrower securitization. The collateral for the transaction is a $2.78 billion floating rate, interest-only mortgage loan. The loan is expected to have an initial two-year term with three, one-year extension options and require monthly interest-only payments. The loan will be secured by the borrowers’ fee simple and leasehold interests in 93 retail assets located on the West Coast. In total, the portfolio contains 10.5 million sf and the properties are located in three states: California (66.0% of loan balance), Washington (22.3%), and Oregon (11.7%). As of December 2024, the portfolio was 96.5% leased to over 1,400 unique tenants.

KBRA’s analysis of the transaction included a detailed evaluation of the property’s cash flows using our North American CMBS Property Evaluation Methodology and the application of our North American CMBS Single Borrower & Large Loan Rating Methodology. In addition, KBRA also relied on its Global Structured Finance Counterparty Methodology for assessing counterparty risk in this transaction, its Methodology for Rating Interest-Only Certificates in CMBS Transactions, and its ESG Global Rating Methodology, to the extent deemed applicable.

The results of our analysis yielded a KBRA net cash flow (KNCF) for the subject of approximately $209.1 million, which is 8.3% below the issuer’s NCF, and a KBRA value of approximately $2.43 billion, which is 36.4% below the appraiser’s as-is value. The resulting in-trust KBRA Loan to Value (KLTV) is 114.4%. In our analysis of the transaction, we also reviewed and considered third party engineering, environmental, and appraisal reports, the results of our site inspection of the property, and legal documentation review.
