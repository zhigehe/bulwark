In conjunction with the Offers, the Issuers are also soliciting (collectively, the "Consent Solicitations") consents (collectively, the "Consents") from Eligible Holders (as defined below) of the Existing Notes to (i) certain proposed amendments (the "Proposed Amendments") to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain of the default provisions, and certain other provisions contained in each indenture governing the applicable series of Existing Notes and (ii) with respect to each series of Existing Primo Notes, release the note guarantee of each guarantor of such series of Existing Primo Notes (the "Primo Guarantor Releases").

The Offers and Consent Solicitations are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a confidential offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, dated January 27, 2025 (the "Offering Memorandum"). The amount of Tendered Notes and related Consents is expected to result in the satisfaction of the conditions that (i) no less than $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of each tranche of New Notes (or the euro-equivalent, in the case of the New Secured Euro Notes) shall be issued in exchange for a tranche of Existing Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and (ii) the requisite consents to the Proposed Amendments and the Primo Guarantor Releases have been obtained.

The Issuers also announced that they have elected to have an early settlement for the Tendered Notes accepted by the Issuers. Such early settlement is expected to occur on February 12, 2025 (the "Early Settlement Date"), subject to all the conditions to the applicable Offer having been satisfied or waived by the Issuers, including the condition that the Credit Facilities Transactions (as defined below) shall be consummated.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance of the New Notes on the Early Settlement Date, the Company expects to (i) repay any amounts outstanding, and terminate commitments, under the BlueTriton Issuer's existing revolving credit facility, (ii) repay any amounts outstanding, and terminate commitments, under the Primo Issuer's existing revolving credit facility, and (iii) enter into an amended credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") providing for, among other things, \* a repricing of the Company's existing term loan facility and (y) a new revolving credit facility, which will provide for revolving loans, swing line loans, and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $750.0 million and which will mature in February 2030 (the transactions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), the "Credit Facilities Transactions," and the Credit Facilities Transactions, together with the Offers and Consent Solicitations, collectively, the "Refinancing Transactions"). The Refinancing Transactions may not be consummated on the terms described in this press release or at all. The complete terms and conditions of the Refinancing Transactions are set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

The withdrawal deadline for the Offers and Consent Solicitations occurred at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 7, 2025 (the "Withdrawal Deadline"). As a result, and because the Withdrawal Deadline is not being extended by the Issuers, the Tendered Notes and related consents may no longer be withdrawn, except in limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. Following the Withdrawal Deadline, the applicable Issuer, the guarantors of the Existing BlueTriton Notes, as applicable, and the applicable trustees under each indenture governing the applicable series of Existing Notes entered into supplemental indentures to give effect to the Proposed Amendments and the Primo Guarantor Releases. The Proposed Amendments and the Primo Guarantor Releases are expected to become operative upon the Early Settlement Date. As a result of the Proposed Amendments becoming operative on the Early Settlement Date, among other things, all of the shares of the Company's Class B common stock, which are currently held by an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC ("One Rock"), shall automatically convert into an equal number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock and One Rock will no longer be subject to the limitation on voting no more than 49% of the shares of the Company's Class A common stock outstanding, as described in the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

Holders of Tendered Notes are eligible to receive (i) for each €1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Primo 2028 Notes validly tendered for exchange, €1,000 in aggregate principal amount of New Secured Euro Notes and a cash payment of €2.50, (ii) for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Primo 2029 Notes validly tendered for exchange, $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of New Secured Dollar Notes and a cash payment of $2.50, and (iii) for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing BlueTriton Notes validly tendered for exchange, $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of New Unsecured Notes and a cash payment of $2.50 (with respect to each series of Existing Notes, as applicable, the "Total Consideration"). In addition to the Total Consideration, the Issuers will pay in cash all of the accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes accepted in the Offers from the applicable latest interest payment date for such series of Existing Notes to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date.

Eligible Holders of Existing Notes who validly tender their Existing Notes and deliver their related consents after the Early Tender Date, and at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 25, 2025, unless extended by the Issuers (the "Expiration Date"), will be eligible to receive (i) for each €1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Primo 2028 Notes validly tendered for exchange, €970 in aggregate principal amount of New Secured Euro Notes, (ii) for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Primo 2029 Notes validly tendered for exchange, $970 in aggregate principal amount of New Secured Dollar Notes, and (iii) for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing BlueTriton Notes validly tendered for exchange, $970 in aggregate principal amount of New Unsecured Notes (with respect to each series of Existing Notes, as applicable, the "Exchange Consideration"). If, at or prior to the Expiration Date, all conditions to the applicable Offer have been or are concurrently satisfied or waived by the Issuers, the Issuers may accept for exchange all Existing Notes validly tendered in such Offers after the Early Tender Date and at or prior to the Expiration Date (the date of such exchange, the "Final Settlement Date"). The Final Settlement Date, if any, will be promptly after the Expiration Date and is currently expected to occur on February 28, 2025, the third business day immediately following the Expiration Date. In addition to the Exchange Consideration payable in exchange for Existing Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Issuers will pay in cash all of the accrued and unpaid interest on any Existing Notes accepted in the Offers from the applicable latest interest payment date for such series of Existing Notes to, but not including, the Final Settlement Date. Eligible Holders who receive New Notes in exchange for Existing Notes on the Final Settlement Date will receive New Notes that will, if the Early Settlement Date has occurred, have an embedded entitlement to pre-issuance interest for the period from, and including, the Early Settlement Date to, but not including, the Final Settlement Date. As a result, the cash payable for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes exchanged on the Final Settlement Date will be reduced by the amount of pre-issuance interest on the New Notes exchanged therefor.

The New Notes will be guaranteed by Primo Brands and substantially all of Primo Brands' material, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions. In addition, the New Secured Notes will be secured on a first lien basis by substantially all of the assets of each of the Issuers and the New Notes Guarantors (as defined in the Offering Memorandum), as well as equity pledges on the stock or other equity interests of Primo Water Corporation and Primo Water Holdings UK Limited, subject to certain customary exceptions, which liens shall be *pari passu* with the liens securing the Amended Credit Agreement. The Existing Primo Notes are currently guaranteed only by the Existing Primo Notes Guarantors (as defined in the Offering Memorandum), and, following the Primo Guarantor Releases, are not expected to be guaranteed by any guarantors. The Existing BlueTriton Notes are guaranteed only by the Existing BlueTriton Notes Guarantors, and not by any of the Existing Primo Notes Guarantors. In addition, no series of the Existing Notes are secured by liens on any collateral.

The Company will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes in connection with the Offers. The Existing Notes acquired in the Offers will be retired and cancelled. The Company intends to use cash on hand to pay (i) the cash component of any consideration payable, (ii) the accrued but unpaid interest on the Existing Notes exchanged in the Offers, and (iii) other related estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing Transactions.

The Issuers reserve the right to amend the terms of the Offers and Consent Solicitations, either as a whole or with respect to one or more series of the Existing Notes, without extending the Early Tender Date or the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to applicable law. The Offers and Consent Solicitations are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum. The Issuers reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to extend, amend, terminate, or withdraw the Offers and Consent Solicitations at any time. In the event an Offer is terminated, such Offer will not be consummated, the related Proposed Amendments and Primo Guarantor Releases, as applicable, will not become operative, tendering Eligible Holders will not receive any consideration, Existing Notes tendered pursuant to such Offer will be promptly returned to such Eligible Holders, and the related consents will be deemed void.

The Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made, and the New Notes are being offered and issued, pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") promulgated thereunder, and are also not being registered under any state or foreign securities laws. The New Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Offers and Consent Solicitations will only be made, and the New Notes are only being offered and issued, to holders of Existing Notes who are (a) reasonably believed to be "qualified institutional buyers" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (b) institutional accredited investors, as defined in SEC Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7), or (c) not "U.S. persons," as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S under the Securities Act (such holders, the "Eligible Holders"), and only Eligible Holders who have completed and returned the eligibility certification are authorized to receive or review this Offering Memorandum or to participate in the Offers and Consent Solicitations.

None of the Company, the dealer managers and solicitation agents for the Offers and Consent Solicitations, the Exchange Agent, the Information Agent, any trustee or collateral agent for any series of Existing Notes or New Notes, or any affiliate of any of them makes any recommendation as to whether any Eligible Holder of Existing Notes should tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of the principal amount of such Eligible Holder's Existing Notes for New Notes in the Offers. No one has been authorized by any of them to make such a recommendation. Eligible Holders must make their own decision whether to tender Existing Notes in the Offers and, if so, the amount of such Existing Notes to tender.

Only Eligible Holders may receive a copy of the Offering Memorandum and participate in the Offers and Consent Solicitations.

Although management believes that it has a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this press release, you are cautioned that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by the Company and its expectations of the future, about which it cannot be certain. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: risks related to the New Notes; the ability of the Company to consummate the Offers and Consent Solicitations in a timely manner or at all; the Company's ability to compete successfully in the markets in which it operates; fluctuations in commodity prices and the Company's ability to pass on increased costs to its customers or hedge against such rising costs, and the impact of those increased prices on the Company's volumes; the Company's ability to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with its suppliers; the Company's ability to manage supply chain disruptions and cost increases related to inflation; the Company's ability to manage its operations successfully; adverse changes in general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates; any disruption to production at the Company's manufacturing facilities; the Company's ability to maintain access to its water sources; the impact of climate change on the Company's business; the Company's ability to protect its intellectual property; the seasonal nature of the Company's business and the effect of adverse weather conditions; the impact of national, regional, and global events, including those of a political, economic, business, and competitive nature, such as the Russia/Ukraine war or the Israel/Hamas conflict; the impact of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, related government actions, and the Company's strategy in response thereto on its business; difficulties with integrating the businesses of Primo Water Corporation ("Primo Water") and Triton Water Parent, Inc.

As a result of these factors, the Company cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this press release will prove to be accurate. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact the Company's business. Moreover, Primo Brands operates in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Furthermore, if any forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by Primo Brands or any other person that the Company will achieve its objectives, plans, or cost savings in any specified time frame or at all. In addition, even if its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which the Company operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
