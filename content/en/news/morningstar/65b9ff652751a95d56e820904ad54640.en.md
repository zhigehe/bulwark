poppi, the prebiotic soda brand revolutionizing soda for the next generation, made a splashy return to the Super Bowl this year with their new **[Soda Thoughts TV commercial](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358672-1&h=2604449915&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4LDn46rb_gc&a=Soda+Thoughts+TV+commercial)**. A compilation of relatable everyday moments, poppi reminds consumers that a better soda exists, and can be enjoyed any time without second thoughts.

The soda of the next generation requires voices from the next generation which is why poppi is proud to work with some of the biggest creators in the game - existing brand partners like poppi investor & social media powerhouse Alix Earle, comedian Jake Shane, and star of "Love Island USA" Rob Rausch on this campaign.

"There is no bigger soda moment than the Super Bowl, and we're thrilled to have been a part of it for the second year in a row," says poppi Co-Founder Allison Ellsworth. "This is the biggest way to reach a mass audience and introduce new fans to the poppi brand. We wanted to show people that they have better soda options, and continue to engage with our community by amplifying some of their favorite creators."

For the second year, the creative was developed in partnership with VIRTUE Worldwide, and Tinuiti served as the brand's media partner. The commercial was directed by Dave Meyers, one of the industry's most prolific and sought-after commercial & music video talents.

"In last year's Super Bowl spot we introduced the future of soda and put a stake in the ground that poppi is THE better-for-you-soda," said Nari Kim, Group Creative Director of VIRTUE Worldwide.  This year we wanted to go a little deeper with a powerful consumer insight. We've all been there…when you're at the movies, at a party, ordering a burger…and you just *really* want a soda. But you get stuck in an analysis paralysis because you think soda isn't good for you. Cue poppi. It not only tastes great, but it's a better soda, so you can have your burger and soda too. And we're really excited to show the world what that looks like."
