**Positioning Lakesound Amid Dallas-Fort Worth Multifamily Market Trends**

The DFW rental market continues to thrive, driven by job growth, population influx, and business relocations. According to the **Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2025** report by ULI and PwC, Dallas-Fort Worth is the top market for real estate prospects, propelled by strong fundamentals such as a robust job market, significant population growth, and an attractive business environment, alongside sustained investor demand.

“The DFW multifamily sector is evolving as demand for high-quality Class A properties like Lakesound grows,” said Scott Lyday, Managing Director of Design & Construction at Leon Multifamily.

Key market trends influencing the sector include:

* **Population Growth**: Dallas-Fort Worth attracts young professionals and families with its booming job market and exceptional quality of life.
* **Demand & Absorption**: The Dallas-Fort Worth area is leading in new apartment deliveries, but with high absorption rates underscoring the regions strong multifamily housing demand.
* **Occupancy & Rent Stability**: Class A multifamily properties maintain high occupancy levels, with minimal rent fluctuations.
* **Suburban Growth**: Submarkets between Dallas, Fort Worth and Denton are benefiting from population shifts and heightened demand.

**Luxury Living in a Prime Location**

“The Lake Cities region, including Hickory Creek, is flourishing with infrastructure, businesses, and community appeal,” said Christy Chumley, VP of Operations at Leon Multifamily. “This area is becoming one of the more desirable destinations for renters in North Texas.”

Conveniently located near major DFW hubs and Lewisville Lake, Lakesound offers a tranquil retreat with abundant outdoor recreation opportunities. It also features resort-style amenities, including a sparkling pool, state-of-the-art fitness center and scenic lakeside walking trails.

“We anticipate strong demand for Lakesound as demographic trends and job growth fuel interest in luxury multifamily living,” added Chumley.
