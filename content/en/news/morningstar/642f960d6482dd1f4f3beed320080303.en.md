**Shareholder Alert: Ademi & Fruchter LLP Investigates Whether Intevac, Inc. Is Obtaining a Fair Price for Its Public Shareholders**

There is no cost or obligation to you.

In the tender offer transaction, Intevac stockholders will receive only $4.00 per share, with an additional $.102 per share to be paid in connection with an Intevac special and regular quarterly dividend. Intevac insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.

The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing transactions for Intevac by imposing a significant penalty if Intevac accepts a competing bid. We are investigating the conduct of Intevacâ€™s board of directors, and whether they are fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders.

We specialize in shareholder litigation involving buyouts, mergers, and individual shareholder rights. For more information, please feel free to call us. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.
