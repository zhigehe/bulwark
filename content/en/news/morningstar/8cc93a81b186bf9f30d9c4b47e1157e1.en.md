TOKYO--The Japanese government has approached the U.S. about President Trump's plan to implement tariffs to match the duties set by other countries, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Friday.

"We have already begun communicating with the U.S.," Japan's top government spokesman said at a news conference.

"We will respond appropriately, while thoroughly examining the details of the measure that will become clearer in the future and the impact on our country," he added.

The comments came after Trump on Thursday ordered federal agencies to explore how to set reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports on a country-by-country basis, a move aimed at filling trade gaps. The studies, which are due to be completed by April 1, could see tariffs imposed on many U.S. trading partners, but it is unclear what metrics will be used to calculate the duties.

In 2024, Japan had a trade surplus of 8.642 trillion yen with the U.S., equivalent to $56.56 billion.
