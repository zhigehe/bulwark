NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --

[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598307/32a64817_10ba_407b_947c_76bd790799f6_Logo.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2598307/32a64817_10ba_407b_947c_76bd790799f6_Logo.html)

Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) between August 26, 2022 and November 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 1, 2025.

So what: If you purchased Target common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

What to do next: To join the Target class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=6812](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359157-1&h=2547918230&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D6812&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D6812) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 1, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, Target misled investors by making false and misleading statements about Target's Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") mandates that led to widespread customer boycotts following Target's 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign (the "Campaign"). The negative effects of the Campaign on Target's business, including a subsequent campaign in 2024 (the "2024 Campaign"), led to a massive decline in Target's stock price.

Specifically, the Campaign offended certain Target customers, provoking consumer backlash and boycotts that caused Target's sales to fall for the first time in six years. Unbeknownst to investors, and contrary to Target's public statements, its CEO and Board of directors did not oversee or disclose the known risks of Target's 2023 or 2024 Campaigns. This deceit, through misleading statements in Target's public filings, caused Target investors to purchase Target stock at artificially inflated prices. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Target class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=6812](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4359157-1&h=2547918230&u=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D6812&a=https%3A%2F%2Frosenlegal.com%2Fsubmit-form%2F%3Fcase_id%3D6812) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
