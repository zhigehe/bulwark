NEW YORK, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

**WHY:** Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) between November 2, 2023 and October 30, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important **March 10, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.**

**SO WHAT:** If you purchased Regeneron securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

**WHAT TO DO NEXT:** To join the Regeneron class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=33630](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WvaRS3WOMLp2t3uBqTECi5UWhmihCc-aX_rgQbP1NTE2CBQO5Xh3dam2mlgSPvx8LKT48s2h6qn3cP8N6Ro4BqpVI4e1UI5wqwLgG7CdrEu5h4LQT8ppi5iIY8ix1wVbeY11HWTgmOE3clZa6wZn-Cv4dDaPB1eTRZ2errtPdk4=) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Yi6G2RejTI4sjLLh372giWkvHTgjZT_oXNpfovrSFGsBVH_gYFsEgddz5jVX8qT7tJmxhZLtj48kUEHAmqXKHWbiiB16vEGjmU4F-GnHksM=) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court **no later than March 10, 2025.** A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

**WHY ROSEN LAW:** We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. **Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.** Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

**DETAILS OF THE CASE:** According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Regeneron paid credit card fees to distributors on the condition that distributors did not charge Eylea customers, one of Regeneron’s primary products, more to use a credit card; (2) these payments subsidized the prices that customers paid when using credit cards to purchase Eylea; (3) as a result, Regeneron offered a price concession that lowered Eylea’s selling price; (4) because retina practices were sensitive to higher prices when using credit cards to purchase anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (“anti-VEGF”) medications, Regeneron’s price concessions provided a competitive advantage; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Regeneron misleadingly boosted reported Eylea sales; (6) by failing to report its payment of credit card fees as price concessions, Regeneron overstated the Average Sales Price (“ASP”) reported to federal agencies, thereby violating the False Claims Act; and (7) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Regeneron’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
