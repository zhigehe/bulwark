By Michael Susin

Nestle reported its weakest annual organic sales growth in more than two decades, hit by a pullback in consumer spending after years of high inflation.

The Swiss maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee said Thursday that organic sales grew 2.2% in 2024.

The figure marks a sharp slowdown from the organic sales growth of 7.2% Nestle reported for 2023 and compares with analysts' expectations of 2.1%, according to consensus estimates provided by the company.
