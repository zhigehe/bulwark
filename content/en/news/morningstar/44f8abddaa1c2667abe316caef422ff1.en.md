**Office Properties Income Trust Issues Supplement to Previously Announced Private Exchange Offers Relating to Existing Senior Unsecured Notes to Reflect Certain Financial Information in its 10-K Filed Earlier Today**

[Office Properties Income Trust (Nasdaq: OPI)](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opireit.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54206431&newsitemid=20250213694477&lan=en-US&anchor=Office+Properties+Income+Trust+%28Nasdaq%3A+OPI%29&index=1&md5=47b736b4a4ab14c2fae1d61d4ad05799) (“OPI”) today announced that it has supplemented the Offering Memorandum dated as of February 7, 2025 (the “Offering Memorandum”) with respect to its previously announced private exchange offers (the “Exchange Offers”) to exchange its outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2026, 2027 and 2031 (collectively, the “Existing Notes”) for new 8.000% Senior Priority Guaranteed Unsecured Notes due 2030 (the “New Notes”) and related guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

**Supplement to Offering Memorandum**

OPI previously announced the Exchange Offers on February 7, 2025. In connection with OPI’s announcement of its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, OPI has issued a Supplement to the Offering Memorandum to reflect certain financial information reflected in its annual report on form 10-K for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 (such Supplement to the Offering Memorandum, the “Supplement”). Eligible Holders (as defined below) who wish to participate in the Exchange Offers should carefully read the Supplement in conjunction with the Offering Memorandum. The terms and conditions of the Exchange Offers remain as set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

**No Registration**

The offer and sale of the New Notes and related guarantees will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws, and the New Notes and related guarantees will therefore be subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. OPI does not intend to register the sale of any of the New Notes and related guarantees under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and is not providing registration rights. The New Notes and related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons (other than distributors) absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements and may not be transferred by any holder except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum.

**Eligible Holders**

The Exchange Offers are being made, and the New Notes and related guarantees are being offered and issued, only to holders who have certified to OPI that either they are (a) in the U.S. and are “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and are holders of the Existing Notes, (b) outside the U.S. and are holders of the Existing Notes who are non-U.S. persons in reliance upon and in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or (c) institutions and holders of the Existing Notes that can certify they are institutional “accredited investors” as defined in subparagraph (a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Rule 501 under the Securities Act (such holders, collectively, “Eligible Holders”). Only Eligible Holders are authorized to receive or review the Offering Memorandum and Supplement or to participate in the Exchange Offers.

The Offering Memorandum and Supplement are only available to holders who complete an eligibility letter confirming their status as Eligible Holders.
