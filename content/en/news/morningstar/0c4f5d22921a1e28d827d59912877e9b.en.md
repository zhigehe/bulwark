**DEFENDANTS' ALLEGED MISCONDUCT:**

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) certain of the company's non-emergency medical transportation contracts, rather than mitigating the risks to cash flow as ModivCare asserted, actually negatively impacted its free cash flow; (2) contract renegotiations and pricing accommodations negatively impacted the company's adjusted EBITDA; (3) ModivCare had insufficient liquidity; and (4) as a result, Defendants' statements about the company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:**

ModivCare investors may, ***no later than March 31, 2025,*** seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through [Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4362834-1&h=3838096885&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ktmc.com%2Fnew-cases%2Fmodivcare-inc%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dmodv%26mktm%3Dr&a=Kessler+Topaz+Meltzer+%26+Check%2C+LLP) or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
