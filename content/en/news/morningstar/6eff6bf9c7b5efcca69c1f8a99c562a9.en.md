Powell said Fed is 'holding where we are' awaiting more data

The hotter-than-expected January CPI data will make the Federal Reserve more cautious about inflation risks, with more Fed watchers saying the central bank wouldn't cut rates at all this year.

U.S. headline CPI inflation rose 0.5% in January, much hotter than expected. Core inflation was up 0.4%, also above expectations.

Federal Chairman Jerome Powell tried to push back on the view that the CPI data was a game changer for the central bank.

Powell said the data wasn't much different from earlier reports that showed the Fed was "close but not there" on getting inflation back to its 2% target.

Last year, personal consumption expenditures inflation was running at a 2.6% rate, above the Fed's 2% target, he noted.

"Today's report says the same thing," Powell said.

Powell said he had "two notes of caution" about the data. First, he said, the Fed looks at longer-term trends.

"We don't get excited about one or two bad readings," he said.

Second, the Fed targets PCE inflation, which he called a better measure of price pressures.

The Labor Department will release producer-price data on Thursday and, after that, economists and the Fed will be able to gauge the January PCE inflation rate, even though the actual data won't be released until Feb. 28.

In general, the PCE index tends to show a lower inflation rate than the CPI.

But economists said the Fed would definitely be more worried in the wake of the data.

"Today's CPI data report will likely result in the Fed becoming more cautious about inflation risks," said Aichi Amemiya, an economist at Nomura Securities.

"We have become more confident in our Fed call of no rate cuts this year," he added.

Powell repeated that the Fed was in no hurry to lower rates further.

"We want to keep policy restrictive for now," he said. "My colleagues and I are holding where we are, awaiting further evidence on inflation."

"Restrictive" means high enough to dampen demand and push down inflation.

The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 100 basis points over the last four months of 2024. Powell has said rates remain restrictive, but the issue is not settled at the central bank.

Fed rate cuts are clearly on hold for the foreseeable future, according to economists.

"Surely, Jay Powell is relieved he has already shifted the Fed into a 'no hurry' mode on rate cuts," said Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies.

Powell said the rise in long-term interest rates since the Fed started cutting was not due to investor worries about inflation.

He also said he understood that people were unhappy about the increase in price levels since 2021.

"What we need are several years of real wages moving up higher than inflation" to get consumers back to where they were before, Powell said.

Traders in federal-funds futures now expect only one quarter-point rate cut this year, coming sometime in the final three months of the year.

Jeffrey Rosenkranz, a portfolio manager at Shelton Capital Management, suggested in a phone interview with MarketWatch that the latest CPI data "will call into question whether the next move is a hike rather than a cut."

Former Fed governor Frederic Mishkin said the central bank's effort to get inflation back to 2% "has sort of stalled" but didn't think the Fed would think about raising rates at this point.

Powell never mentioned the possibility of a hike. He told lawmakers that if inflation does not move down toward 2%, the Fed "can maintain the policy restraint for longer."

On Wednesday morning, Trump posted on the Truth Social platform, "Interest rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs."
