Perdoceo Education Corporation (NASDAQ: PRDO), a provider of postsecondary education programs, today announced that Hanna Skandera has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. Ms. Skandera’s appointment follows a February 3, 2025 vote by the Board of Directors to expand the number of eligible board seats from eight to nine.

Ms. Skandera currently serves as president and CEO of the Daniels Fund. The Daniels Fund is a $1.7 billion philanthropic organization that equips people to reach their fullest potential. The Fund provides grants to highly effective nonprofits, has launched the National Civics Bee which is now in 200 cities across 40 states, and provides college scholarships to the next generation of America’s leaders. The Daniels Fund has given away $1.2 billion to more than 6,000 grantees and over 5,000 Daniels Scholars since its founding in 2000. Joining the organization’s board in 2019 and taking the helm in 2021, Ms. Skandera demonstrates a strong commitment to impact and positively influence American life.

Ms. Skandera is nationally recognized for her bold leadership, entrepreneurial vision, and focus on outcomes. As Secretary of Education in New Mexico under Governor Susana Martinez, Ms. Skandera realized significant improvements in academic achievement and effective management of a $2.7 billion budget. She previously served as Undersecretary for California Governor Schwarzenegger and as Deputy Commissioner for Florida Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Policy Advisor at the U.S. Department of Education.

In addition to her policy and business acumen, Ms. Skandera has served as visiting professor at the Pepperdine School of Public Policy, a Distinguished Teaching Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, and a research fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Pepperdine has honored her as both a Distinguished Alumna and an Outstanding Woman in Leadership.

Ms. Skandera serves on the boards of Daniels Fund, Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, MGT, Philanthropy Roundtable, and Risepoint.
