In the fourth quarter alone, the company recorded KRW98.2 billion in net sales, KRW46.6 billion in operating profit, and KRW40.7 billion in net income, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%, 26.7%, and 130%, respectively.

**NET SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY TOXIN, HA FILLERS, COSMETICS**

Hugel's botulinum toxin, branded as Botulax in South Korea and globally known as Letybo, achieved KRW203.2 billion in net sales in 2024 with a 20.2% increase on-year. The overseas sales of the botulinum toxin rose 39.6% on-year, fueled by strong performance in major Asia-Pacific markets, shipment to the US, and robust growth in Europe.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, branded as THE CHAEUM and BYRYZN in South Korea and globally known as Revolax, achieved KRW127.6 billion in net sales for 2024. The overseas sales of dermal fillers rose 13.2% on-year, led by steady shipments to China and continued growth in Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Hugel focuses on marketing activities for the fillers to increase brand awareness while maintaining leadership in South Korea and expanding its presence in global markets.

Hugel's cosmetics business, represented by brands WELLAGE and BYRYZN BR, showed rapid growth last year. Net sales of the cosmetics business jumped 37.8% on-year to KRW36.9 billion in 2024. In the fourth quarter, net sales soared 48.1% on-year to KRW11.7 billion. Hugel is strengthening the cosmetics brand value by releasing the Hyper Peptide series of WELLAGE last August and promoting BYRYZN BR, launched in April 2024.

**GLOBAL EXPANSION ACCELERATES WITH TOXIN ENTRY IN THE US, MENA, AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS** 

Hugel will continue to focus on expanding sales and increasing market dominance abroad this year.

The company is prioritizing sales and marketing efforts in the US, where it plans to officially launch its botulinum toxin in the first half of the year. Hugel aims to capture 10% of the US medical aesthetics market within three years, differentiating itself through academic events for medical professionals and competitive pricing strategies.

Hugel will also accelerate its expansion in MENA, a key emerging market for medical aesthetics. The company targets a 30% share within three years in major markets, including the United Arab Emirates where it obtained a marketing license in January of this year and Kuwait where it has been present for 2.5 years.

"We achieved the highest net sales, operating profit, and net income in 2024 since our inception with significant growth in flagship products such as botulinum toxin and hyaluronic acid fillers and new growth driver cosmetics. We will continue expansion in our new markets, including North America and MENA, while strengthening our leadership position in Asia-Pacific and Europe and solidifying our position as a global industry leader", a Hugel official said.
