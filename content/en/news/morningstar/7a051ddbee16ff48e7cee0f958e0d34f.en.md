**CASE ALLEGATIONS**: Neumora is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that engages in developing therapeutic treatments for brain diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. According to the complaint, Neumora acquired Navacaprant, Neumora’s flagship therapeutic candidate, in September 2020 through its acquisition of BlackThorn Therapeutics, Inc. In its IPO, Neumora sold 14.7 million shares at $17.00 per share.

The *Neumora* class action lawsuit alleges that the IPO’s offering documents were materially false and/or misleading and/or failed to disclose that: (i) in order for Neumora to justify conducting its Phase Three Program, Neumora was forced to amend BlackThorn’s original Phase Two Trial inclusion criteria to include a patient population with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (“MDD”) to show that Navacaprant offered a statistically significant improvement in treating MDD; (ii) and to that same end, Neumora also added a prespecified analysis to the Phase Two statistical analysis plan, focusing on patients suffering from moderate to severe MDD; and (iii) the Phase Two Trials lacked adequate data, particularly in regards to the patient population size and the ratio of male to female patients within the patient population, to be able to accurately predict the results of the KOASTAL-1 study.

The *Neumora* class action lawsuit further alleges that on January 2, 2025, Neumora revealed that the KOASTAL-1 study failed to “demonstrate a statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 6 or the key secondary endpoint of a change from baseline in the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) scale.”

Since the IPO, the value of Neumora common stock shares has declined substantially from the IPO price of $17 per share to a closing price of $1.91 per share on February 5, 2025 (a 88.7% decline from the IPO price), the complaint alleges.

**THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS**: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Neumora common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement issued in connection with the IPO to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the *Neumora* class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the *Neumora* class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the *Neumora* class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the *Neumora* class action lawsuit.
