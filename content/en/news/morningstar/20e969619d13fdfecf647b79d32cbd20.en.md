Health-Ade Launches New Prebiotic Sodas, Dr. Bubbles SunSip and Cream Soda SunSip

Dr. Bubbles and Cream Soda join SunSip's existing lineup of classic and craveable prebiotic sodas that transport you to those sweet summer days. Dr. Bubbles reimagines the conventional Doctor soda's flavor profile with a unique blend of sweet fruit–notably black cherry–with subtle spices for an instant bubbly classic, while Cream Soda captures the timeless flavor of creamy vanilla with delicate caramelized notes, offering a bubbly ode to soda fountain classics. Unlike other soda options loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients, SunSip is naturally sweetened with fruit juice, monk fruit, and organic cane sugar—NO stevia in sight. In fact, each 11.5 oz can of SunSip contains 6 grams of sugar or less and 40 calories or less, making it the perfect swap for sugary sodas, without compromising on taste. Plus, SunSip goes a step beyond with added benefits including prebiotics, vitamins C, B6, and B12, and minerals zinc and selenium to help promote gut health, everyday immunity, and energy.

Exploding onto the better-for-you soda scene last year, SunSip quickly made a name for itself as a leader in modern sodas with secured shelf space at over 5,000 retailers nationwide, over 1.8 million cans sold, and the most trial among new prebiotic sodas (source: Numerator, among Prebiotic & Probiotic Sodas launched in 2024). With continued flavor innovation in response to consumer demand, the launch of Dr. Bubbles and Cream Soda is perfectly timed to the surging interest in nostalgic soda flavors. Of note, Dr. Bubbles is inspired by Dr. Pepper's rise as the #2 soda brand in 2024, driven by its unique flavor profile, and the Doctor flavor is in the top 10 prebiotic soda flavors with accelerated growth. In tandem, Cream Soda taps into the popularity of creamy, wistful flavors like the Orange Creamsicle craze of 2024 when Health-Ade's seasonal Orange Creamsicle kombucha flavor earned press coverage with TODAY, Los Angeles Daily News, and more, proving that the brand keeps pace with current flavor trends that consumers crave by tapping into nostalgia. These new SunSip flavors with a uniquely sweet soda base and without the tell-tale stevia taste, continue with a better-for-you take on the trend, acting as a dreamy new addition to the SunSip lineup. For many, concerns around stevia as well as a dislike of the stevia aftertaste, can drive them to look for new options like SunSip.

Also launching this month, SunSip unveils their latest campaign: Sundeniably Good Soda, made in partnership with creative agency, [FUNDA](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360632-1&h=1525648940&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funday.agency%2F&a=FUNDA)[Y](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360632-1&h=1281613434&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funday.agency%2F&a=Y). This national, omni-channel campaign, which includes paid social presence across Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, digital video ads including CTV and OTT, banners, Out of Home advertising, and more, challenges the outdated belief that what's good for you has to taste bad. Rooted in cheeky, inquisitive humor and a retro vibe, the campaign challenges consumers to rethink what is possible, proving that soda can be gut-healthy and delicious. With thought-provoking commentary coupled with an aesthetic that romanticizes the past, SunSip's latest marketing initiative encapsulates whimsical escapism with a modern twist.

Health-Ade's Chief Marketing Officer, Charlotte Mostaed, comments on the upcoming launch: "Dr. Bubbles and Cream Soda are the perfect marriage of nostalgia and innovation. These craveable soda flavors allow us to reimagine the classics in a way that's better for you and better for your gut. We're hopeful they'll reach both new and existing consumers so they can experience all the bubbly, gut-health goodness SunSip has to offer, while also being able to revisit soda flavors they've probably been missing."

With this launch, Dr. Bubbles and Cream Soda join a robust lineup of SunSip flavors, including Cherry Cola, Raspberry Lemonade, Root Beer, Peach, Strawberry Vanilla, and Lemon Lime. Dr. Bubbles and Cream Soda will retail for $2.49 per can and will be available exclusively at Whole Foods for the first six months of launch before expanding to other retailers. Fans can also find them online at[www.sunsip.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360632-1&h=1182631404&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunsip.com%2F&a=www.sunsip.com).
