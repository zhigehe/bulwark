* Advocate for policy reform
* Empower the next generation of leaders

*Disrupt NOW* combats extreme misogyny, increases feminism education and advocates for women's equality and safety.

These objectives will be achieved and measured through:

* Number of partnerships
* Responses to calls to action
* Legislative wins
* Election outcomes

"We must continue to do the work. We must show up, not give up. I remind myself of all the work done to get us this far, and we must keep marching forward," said National NOW President Christian F. Nunes. "We stand on the shoulders of great candidates and activists which gives me hope. Lucretia Mott kept marching. Ida B. Wells continued writing. And Cong. John Lewis always got in good trouble. And we will too."

Through a partnership with Yale University TCS, *Disrupt NOW* will also train candidates and activists on how to advocate for issues in their communities. Other partners include American Association of University Women, Common Cause, ERA Coalition, Feminist Majority, Future Forward Women, League of Women Voters of the United States, MANA, A National Latina Organization, National Council of Jewish Women, One Fair Wage, Black Women's Blueprint and Transformative Justice Coalition.

**Quote from Virginia Kase Solom****ón, President & CEO, Common Cause**"A strong democracy is an inclusive democracy, and that's why it's so important that women and girls have a seat at the table where decisions are being made. Right now, we see too many women left out of the conversation on city councils, in state legislatures, and in Congress. Our democracy is strongest when women's views are not only listened to, but when women can advocate for ourselves in places of power and decision-making."

**Quote from Zakiya Thomas, President & CEO, ERA Coalition**"With the Equal Rights Amendment as the law of the land, we can use it to help disrupt the attacks on our fundamental rights and cement gender equality in our laws. We will continue fighting sex discrimination in pay equity, employment, reproductive health, gender-based violence, financial services, housing, and more."

**Quote from Celina Stewart, Esq. CEO, League of Women Voters of the United States**"This is not the moment to shrink, nor the time to be silent, but this is the time for women to DISRUPT oppression, DISRUPT the attack on our neighbors, DISRUPT the attempt to destroy our freedoms – whether speech, assembly, religion, or our bodies, and anything that we value as people and in our communities."

**Quote from Amy L. Hinojosa,** **President and CEO, MANA, A National Latina Organization**"We are at a pivotal moment in the history of the nation and the actions of women will determine our future. We can clearly see the escalation of threats of violence in person and online, and attacks on our access to healthcare, education, and advancement. Now, more than ever, we must link arms with our hermanas (sisters) nationwide and stand firm in the knowledge that this country does not succeed if women aren't respected and treated as equal. Silence is not an option."

**Quote from Sheila Katz, CEO, National Council of Jewish Women**"For more than a century, National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) has been a steadfast advocate for women, children, and families — driven by our unwavering commitment to fight for the needs of real people, real families, and real struggles. Our Jewish values and moral voice drive us to honor the dignity of every human being and NCJW is more determined than ever to advocate for health care access and economic justice for everyone. We are thrilled to join our partners in the *Disrupt NOW* Campaign to multiply our shared efforts — because when we uplift each other, we all thrive."

**Quote from Saru Jayaraman, President and Founder, One Fair Wage**"As an organization that has long championed a full, livable wage with tips on top for tipped workers - overwhelmingly women who face the highest levels of economic instability and sexual harassment of any workforce - One Fair Wage is proud to support the *Disrupt NOW* Campaign. By focusing on healthcare, the economy, and women's safety, the campaign directly addresses the most pressing challenges facing women and girls across the country. At One Fair Wage, we understand the importance of increasing education and awareness around the issues that disproportionately affect women, particularly in the workplace and particularly for women who earn low and subminimum wages in restaurants and other tipped occupations."

**Quote from Barbara Arnwine, President and Founder, Transformative Justice Coalition**"In this era of serious threat to the fight for equality for all women, especially Black women, it is urgent that we provide education and important organizing to protect our constitutional and statutory rights. Recent executive orders targeting DEI programs have led to the unemployment of women of all races and the dismantlement of vital programming that fought the 'good ole boy' network which has excluded and marginalized women in the workplace. We will not sit idly by and allow these misogynistic actions to prevail but instead will fight with renewed vigor."

**Quote from Patricia Russo, Executive Director, Yale The Campaign School**"The Campaign School at Yale is excited to partner with the National Organization for Women as we work toward our shared vision of political parity in America."
