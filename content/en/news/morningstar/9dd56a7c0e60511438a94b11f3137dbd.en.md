NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of [Kirby McInerney LLP](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rA96U8im2jCklh6QP2cNzKqmBtWxKGZ1J04JJaLDRtygJ3SPQbdUjnB1XBDGcP5u1YitKwYstEhhvEKNUivZJelM3uiPDd9N8SydHE3S4V8=) is investigating potential claims against Semtech Corporation (“Semtech” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:SMTC).

[[LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION]](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1JIgW6L71YubPRDFb_APUAY3-EEmJJzlia_YM_5I-KX9MGSS9gu1gkr4bLkk7BPGcEcAIJXuuYCRqNJR6HVVPi8LAK3-PlmnzhXwL2_dS0VsyU-GxqrbbU3qau5bQyQqdXG21pvYglb47TkBeeC6KiI9sco0VpmIYmryQq7Mvtg=) 

On February 10, 2025, Semtech announced that net sales of its CopperEdge products were expected to fall below its prior floor estimate of $50 million in fiscal year 2026, citing changes in its server rack architecture due to poor feedback from a key customer. This news follows positive statements during its Q3 2024 earnings call in November, where management projected strong sales growth. On this news, the price of Semtech shares declined by $16.91 per share, or approximately 31%, from $54.51 per share on February 7, 2025, to close at $37.60 on February 10, 2025.
