Regulatory News:

[POXEL SA](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.poxel.com%2F&esheet=54204427&newsitemid=20250211765025&lan=en-US&anchor=POXEL+SA&index=1&md5=6dfa640d9ac2ac3cb6addcc36fb16147) (Euronext: POXEL - FR0012432516), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and rare metabolic disorders, today announces that it held its Combined General Meeting on February 11, 2025, at 9;00 am CET at the Mercure Lyon Centre Château Perrache Hotel, located at 12 Cours de Verdun-Rambaud Esplanade de la Gare, 69002 Lyon, France.

The number of voting rights held by shareholders present or represented was 18,380,495, representing a quorum of 34.26%.

Details on the voting results on all resolutions, the replay of the Combined General Meeting as well as the presentation that was made during the meeting, are available today on the [Company’s website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poxelpharma.com%2Fen_us&esheet=54204427&newsitemid=20250211765025&lan=en-US&anchor=Company%26%238217%3Bs+website&index=2&md5=00857f1d916afe2f3e58e40b96870aaa), in the Investors / Shareholder Info / Annual General Meeting Documents section.

The resolutions related to the revised remuneration policy for corporate officers for 2025, as proposed by the Board of Directors, were approved.

The Board of Directors noted the non-adoption of delegations granted to the Board of Directors on financial matters. The absence of adoption of the delegation relating to the IRIS program, in accordance with the agreements made with IRIS and IPF Partners, triggers an event of default under the ORANE and IPF Partners bonds documentation, allowing each of them to request the immediate redemption of their respective bonds. The Board of Directors will proceed, with the management of the Company, to an assessment of the consequences of this non-adoption, will connect to its current creditors and will get back subsequently to the market and Poxel’s shareholders.

* Publication of Fourth Quarter 2024 Cash and Revenue update, on February 19, 2025
