By Mauro Orru

A consortium of Siemens Mobility and construction company Leonhard Weiss secured a contract valued at roughly 2.8 billion euros ($2.89 billion) to roll out modern digital control and safety technology across the German rail network.

Siemens Mobility said the first orders under the framework agreement signed with German railway operator Deutsche Bahn are expected to come as early as this spring.

French train maker Alstom also secured a contract valued at more than 600 million euros with Deutsche Bahn to modernize Germany's rail network.
