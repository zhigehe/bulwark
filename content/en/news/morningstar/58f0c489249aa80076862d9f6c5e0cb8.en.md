By Jiahui Huang

Zeekr Group, the company formed through the acquisition of Lynk & Co by Geely's Zeekr Intelligent Technology, has set an ambitious goal to overtake foreign luxury carmakers in China this year.

The company said in a statement Friday that it aims to sell 710,000 vehicles in 2025, reaching a growth rate of 40%. Zeekr Group plans to "fully surpass BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi in the China market" and hopes to become a leading player in the luxury electric-vehicle sector within the next two years, it said.

China's electric-car market has experienced strong growth in recent years, with sales of battery EVs and plug-in hybrids surpassing that of conventional cars last year. As Chinese EV companies make new models faster, cheaper and with more advanced features, sales of vehicles produced by international joint ventures have come under pressure.

In 2025, Lynk & Co will release two new models, targeting annual sales of 390,000 units, while Zeekr aims to sell 320,000 vehicles by launching three new models launches, according to the statement.
