**Executive Perspectives:**

**Christopher Escarsega, Network Administrator, Tornillo Independent School District**"Teachers want the students to have their devices all the time, and it puts a strain on the Wi-Fi. And it's not just student devices, but teacher devices, smart displays and TVs and applications, all hitting the network... Once we installed the [Extreme] APs... I did a speed test, and I was doubling or tripling what we were getting before. And that's going to make a difference; students will have better connectivity throughout the school."

**Norman Rice, Chief Commercial Officer, Extreme Networks**"A robust, reliable network is transformative to both education and K-12 operations. By driving the convergence of AI, networking and security within a single application, Extreme Platform ONE will help schools maximize productivity and IT budgets while providing a solid foundation for next-generation digital learning. Extreme Platform ONE's rich automation will help teams scale with ease and accommodate the influx of new demands on the network and IT teams in a simple and more flexible way – cutting tasks from hours to minutes. Extreme also helps our customers navigate the E-Rate process by helping them identify the best solutions for their environment and guiding them through the process of eligibility, budget constraints and compliance."
