OTTAWA--Market participants expect the Bank of Canada's policy rate to fall to 2.5% by July, and remain at that level through 2026, according to a central-bank survey issued Monday.

The Bank of Canada conducted the survey of about 30 market participants from mid-December to early January, meaning participants were cognizant of President Trump's threat to impose a 25% on all nonenergy goods and 10% on energy products entering the U.S. Trump withdrew the tariff threat until early March, conditional on Canada fulfilling some promises on fortifying border security and deterring fentanyl trafficking.

The survey said the median from nearly 30 responses via market participants indicated the Bank of Canada's target for the overnight rate would fall to 2.5% by July, and remain at that level through 2026. The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate last month, to 3%, citing excess slack in the economy and the tariff threat from the U.S.

The central bank sets interest rates to achieve and maintain 2% inflation. More than 80% of respondents believe inflation will remain below 3% this year and next year.

The median response from 30 participants indicated a belief the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. would strengthen slightly from current levels, to C$1.38 from the current C$1.43.
