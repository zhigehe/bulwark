By Paul Hannon

The Bank of England's key interest rate should continue to restrain economic activity to ensure that households and businesses don't act in ways that would prolong a coming pickup in inflation, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee said Tuesday.

Catherine L. Mann on Thursday surprised investors by voting to lower the key interest rate by half of a percentage point, a larger move than that favored by the majority. Mann had on a number of previous occasions voted for a higher rate of interest than that favored by the majority.

Despite that vote, Mann said she favors a key rate that is "well above" the 2% to 3% range that neither spurs nor slows growth, as estimated by BOE economists in 2018. That is commonly known as the "neutral" rate.

"The activist policymaker needs to maintain policy rate discipline and restrictiveness even after this immediate decision," she said Tuesday in a speech in Leeds. "This ensures that, as we move through the inflation hump, expectations remain anchored both in the near and longer term."
