By Andrea Figueras

Swiss jeweler and watchmaker Richemont said it has appointed three executives, including the bosses of its flagship brands, to its senior executive committee.

Catherine Renier, chief executive officer of Van Cleef & Arpels, Louis Ferla, CEO of Cartier, and Marie-Aude Stocker, group chief people officer of Richemont, will join the committee, effective immediately, Richemont said Friday.

In July last year, the company reshuffled its core jewelry division, shortly after it tapped Nicolas Bos to replace Jerome Lambert as group CEO.

Lambert, who was appointed CEO of Jaeger-LeCoultre, will step down from the committee.

Boet Brinkgreve, CEO of Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beaute will be leaving the company at the end of April.

The changes come as Richemont has proven the resilience of its jewelry brands in the midst of a wider downturn in demand for luxuries. The jewelry division reported growth for its fiscal third quarter and showed positive signs in the U.S.
