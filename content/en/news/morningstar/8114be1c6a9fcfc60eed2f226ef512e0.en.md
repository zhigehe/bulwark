The Dunkin’ Cinematic Universe began in 2023 when Ben took his fandom to the next level, working a real Dunkin’ drive-thru in the brand’s [first-ever ad](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBBIX9FG6kZ0&esheet=54202637&newsitemid=20250209124144&lan=en-US&anchor=first-ever+ad&index=3&md5=4a3cf55bff776044aedc4c7c3a52bd21) during the pro football championship. From there, it only got wilder: last year, he chased [pop stardom](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D0vMGRxxRPuM%26data%3D05%257C02%257Csavannah.lawandales%2540mslgroup.com%257C341153425ca24c10343408dd42d6b48e%257Cd52c9ea17c2147b182a333a74b1f74b8%257C0%257C0%257C638740212332216809%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3Dc98%252B29OzD4AT70h6WLrBbXJo7CY%252B0qtK%252Bl4b%252BMp5WBQ%253D%26reserved%3D0&esheet=54202637&newsitemid=20250209124144&lan=en-US&anchor=pop+stardom&index=4&md5=b05a428c3cbe4bdcc5d400e17c01bcba), forming [The DunKings](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9gGTJyQFkuY%26t%3D1s&esheet=54202637&newsitemid=20250209124144&lan=en-US&anchor=The+DunKings&index=5&md5=01f87a80ecb050b4b212581713c38efd) in the Dunkin’ big game moment that had everyone talking. Now, with the most epic chapter yet unfolding, one thing is clear: Dunkin’ fans wanted more, and the brand is delivering.

“Everyone wants to be a DunKing! After seeing the incredible response to Ben and the DunKings last year, we created an entire coffee and breakfast universe to extend the fun and make one thing clear: Dunkin’ is for everyone,” said Jill McVicar Nelson, Chief Marketing Officer at Dunkin’. “This latest chapter is bigger, funnier, and full of surprises—and it reinforces what Dunkin’ has always been about: great coffee, fast—plain and simple. We have a lot to offer, from all-day breakfast to high-quality drinks served at the speed of Dunkin’. And while we take those things very seriously, we never take ourselves too seriously. DunKings for life.”

[**DunKings 2: The Movie**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DquS-Ubn1tKA%26list%3DPLnAco0DjXxIYBJtXXcOe6fPTRiPjeY5pD%26index%3D1&esheet=54202637&newsitemid=20250209124144&lan=en-US&anchor=DunKings+2%3A+The+Movie&index=6&md5=d65c2c840ccea751477fe6087c1d898e) **– A Coffee Battle for the Ages**

After last year’s viral debut, The DunKings started a movement and now, everyone wants in. Welcome to Java Jam, a *comic convention-style* battleground where new coffee brand bands go head-to-head for the coveted coffee cup trophy. With challengers emerging and The DunKings’ legacy on the line, Ben is rallying a new crew to defend their title. But can they rise to the occasion?

As Ben returns to maintain the band’s top spot, decked out in a custom Juicy Couture® DunKings tracksuit, his latest recruits for The DunKings 2.0 are unveiled for more Bostonian star power. He’s first joined by **Oscar-winning actor Casey Affleck**, who is reluctant, but pulled into the fun by his big brother. Next to him, there’s a man who knows a thing or two about winning: **eight-time pro football champion Bill Belichick**, along with his record-breaking 24 seasons at the New England Patriots cementing him as an icon in Boston’s sports legacy.

But that’s not all. Ben teases a fourth member as the big surprise. To clench the coffee competition, **Oscar-nominated actor Jeremy Strong** joins the ensemble. Being part of The DunKings isn’t for the faint of heart, it takes commitment. Jeremy knows better than anyone, proving he’s willing to go all in for Dunkin’. Behind the scenes in his dressing room, as intense percussion rhythms play, Jeremy prepares for his role. When Ben and Casey arrive, they find him fully immersed—literally—in Dunkin’ coffee grounds. As he’s “listening to the beans,” Jeremy reveals his epiphany: “Dunkin’ is Boston. Boston is Paul Revere.” So naturally, for The DunKings to win Java Jam, he must channel the essence of perhaps the most famous Bostonian, Paul Revere.

As Jeremy continues his character transformation, The DunKings come face-to-face with their biggest rivals yet: **The Drip Squad**, led by **comedian and actor Druski**, **The Burger Chain Gang** and **The Barista Buds**. The boy bands exchange comedic clap backs as they prepare to battle it out. As the competition reaches peak absurdity, Jeremy breaks the tension and enters as Paul Revere. He fully embraces the patriotic spirit of Revere with revolutionary-era jabs, jokes, backup fife and drums, and even a Dunkin’-centric proclamation, declaring “America *Runneth* on Dunkin’!”

As Jeremy’s pronouncement causes fans to erupt in cheers, the infighting dies down and the rivalry melts away. The bands come together to break bread—or rather coffee and breakfast sandwiches—proving once and for all that“*Dunkin’s for all of you’s*,” as they enjoy **The DunKings $6 Meal Deal**, available at Dunkin’ locations nationwide. And just when it seems to be over, the scene cuts to Ben and Casey debating who started this passionate fandom. A surprise boy band icon steps into the scene, **actor and musician Donnie Wahlberg**—the *New Kids on the Block* legend corrects them both, “I started it,” and pops in for a bite.

**The DunKings $6 Meal Deal and $3 Shakin’ Espresso Offer**

Now, anyone can eat like a DunKing or DunQueen for a limited time with **The DunKings $6 Meal Deal**, available nationwide in a limited-edition band-inspired box. **For $6\*, guests can enjoy a hearty** **Sausage, Egg and Cheese Sandwich**, **crispy Hash Browns and a** **medium Hot (14 oz.) or Iced Coffee** **(24 oz).** It’s a meal that delivers big value with the Dunkin’ classics that guests already love.

And because not every battle is won before noon, Dunkin’ is also rolling out a new **$3 Medium** [**Shakin’ Espresso**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.dunkindonuts.com%2Fnews%2Fwinter-2025-menu&esheet=54202637&newsitemid=20250209124144&lan=en-US&anchor=Shakin%26%238217%3B+Espresso&index=7&md5=2f45c30a92d9dd17262b60b42d5f3dfa)**\*\* offer after 12 p.m.**, perfect for those who need an afternoon encore.
