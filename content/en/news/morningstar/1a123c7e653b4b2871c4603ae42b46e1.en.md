**FTAI** investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at [jlevi@levikorsinsky.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OWSwctVsgLvp6ikFjzuMdRG1L4CVDChON8X0F-_WkkYG1RkK71e0zhd96dcYNcs9yWFgZ2ov4_NZwUDF0xGeKa0hyoAnt2VO0wI1tcN-AOg=) or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.

**CASE DETAILS:** The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (1) the Company reported one-time engine sales as maintenance repair & overhaul revenue when FTAI only performs limited repair and maintenance work on the engine assets sold; (2) FTAI presents whole engine sales as individual module sales, thereby overstating sales and demand; (3) the Company depreciates engines that are not on lease, which misleadingly lowers the reported cost of goods sold and inflates EBITDA; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

**WHAT'S NEXT?** If you suffered a loss in FTAI Aviation during the relevant time frame, you have until **March 18, 2025** to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

**NO COST TO YOU:** If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. **There is no cost or obligation to participate.**
