By Connor Hart

Cisco Systems increased its full-year revenue outlook as sales surpassed expectations in its fiscal second quarter, bolstered by strong demand for its technologies. The networking-equipment company now expects fiscal-year revenue of $56 billion to $56.5 billion, up from $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion. For its three months ended Jan. 25, it posted adjusted earnings of 94 cents a share on revenue of $14 billion, ahead of the 91 cents a share and $13.87 billion that analysts were expecting. Shares rise 6.3%, to $66.50, in after-hours trading.

Robinhood Markets posted a sharp jump in quarterly profit, fueled by a flurry of post-election trading activity. The online-brokerage platform posted a fourth-quarter profit of $916 million, or $1.01 a share, up from $30 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Total net revenue more than doubled to $1.01 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast revenue of $946 million. Average revenue per use doubled to $164. Shares climb 14%, to $63.75, in postmarket trading.

MGM Resorts International said it has experienced strong demand so far in 2025, positioning the company well for growth. The outlook came after the hotel and casino operator's Chinese unit buoyed its fourth-quarter results, notching revenue of $1 billion, up 4% from last year. Overall revenue fell 1% to $4.35 billion but came in ahead of the $4.27 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet expected. Adjusted per-share earnings came in at 45 cents, ahead of the 32 cents that analysts modeled. Shares rise 11%, to $38.20, in after-hours trading.
