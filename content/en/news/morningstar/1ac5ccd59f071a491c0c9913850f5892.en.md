NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

**WHY:** Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces an investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: RCAT) resulting from allegations that Red Cat may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

**SO WHAT:** If you purchased Red Cat securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

**WHAT TO DO NEXT:** To join the prospective class action, go to [https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case\_id=34624](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tiboyl9O3vcnNzptxjZdJXzQfBgv6dCW5R0WGnxk6lJpLnjelHVKeT9ou9YrQqqQt2hQGMonIEni0A5a_3166x_G6U-u8EScDGyuzTWQJg6eB21TgGvp-rN8NzwwbsExRgqj0gGdvbxwXste43PcDesyI4l0BzUuH0sNnSmoZlg=) or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=V2PEc3xDyusz7SZVi6u2hVIY3f4tF-QNAhNTW29nhqayX_l3S8NA_CvyUGibSAnp1cue3w__yuT9awUMJ9SLNsLbXvhYsKhWMwQU_A6ao0o=) for information on the class action.

**WHAT IS THIS ABOUT:** On January 16, 2025, Kerrisdale Capital published a report about Red Cat. In this report, Kerrisdale stated that it was “short shares of Red Cat Holdings, a $1 billion drone manufacturer that’s added more than $900 million in market capitalization over the last 9 months mostly in anticipation of an award for the production of the US Army’s short range reconnaissance (SRR) drone and the supposedly massive market opportunity unlocked by such a high-profile endorsement. But expectations for both the SRR contract size and the potential for follow-on sales bear almost no relationship to reality.”

On this news, the price of Red Cat common stock fell $1.55 per share, or 15%, to close at $8.56 per share on January 17, 2025.

**WHY ROSEN LAW:** We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
