Joey Bertschler authored and orchestrated the most comprehensive earned wage access (EWA) research to date as founder and CEO of Volante Labs, a fintech company pioneering EWA technology. This photo of Joey Bertschler was taken at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. Prior to founding Volante Labs in November 2024, Bertschler led AI development initiatives at OpenAI, developing machine learning solutions for Fortune 500 clients. A graduate of Silicon Valley's BloomTech (formerly Lambda) and Harvard's sustainable business program, he combines technical expertise with entrepreneurial vision. His work has been featured in Forbes and HackerNoon. At Volante Labs, Bertschler leads development of enterprise-grade EWA solutions, working to eliminate predatory lending through innovative payroll technology.

The report, authored by former OpenAI AI specialist and current Volante Labs CEO Joey Bertschler, represents a significant expansion from the company's previous 5-page market analysis. Drawing from his unique background in artificial intelligence and financial technology, Bertschler has created an unprecedented deep dive into the EWA ecosystem.

"The traditional monthly paycheck is a relic of paper-based payroll systems," said Bertschler. "Modern technology has eliminated any technical justification for withholding earned wages. Our research shows that companies implementing EWA solutions are seeing over 300% return on investment while significantly improving employee financial wellness."

**Key findings from the report include:**

* 84% reduction in employee financial stress
* 19% reduction in employee turnover within the first year
* 93% of hourly workers find access to pay before payday helpful
* Over 300% ROI within 12 months for implementing companies

The research reveals that 52% of workers report experiencing financial stress, with 44% having less than $500 saved for unexpected expenses. The analysis identifies approximately $1 trillion in locked payroll funds across OECD countries.

"This isn't just about faster payments â€“ it's about fundamentally restructuring how we think about compensation," Bertschler added. "When employees can access their earned wages as needed, they're less likely to rely on predatory lending services that often charge up to 400% APR."

The comprehensive report includes detailed case studies from major employers like Walmart, Uber, and McDonald's, along with implementation guidelines and market projections indicating EWA adoption will become standard practice by 2025. The research builds upon Bertschler's experience pioneering AI solutions at OpenAI, where he developed enterprise systems for Fortune 500 companies before founding Volante Labs to revolutionize payroll technology.
