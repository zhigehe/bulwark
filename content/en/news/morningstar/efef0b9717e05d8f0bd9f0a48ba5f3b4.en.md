As Editor in Chief, Bernstein will oversee all editorial content and strategy for HBR, including its flagship magazine, digital platforms, books, and events.

“Amy Bernstein is a highly respected and brilliant editor who has worked closely with Adi in driving HBR’s evolution for more than a decade,” said Sarah McConville, Co-President of Harvard Business Publishing. “There is no one better suited than Amy to build on Harvard Business Review’s 103-year legacy of publishing the best ideas in business and management.”

Bernstein joined HBR in 2011 as Editor. In her role overseeing the magazine and its team of editors, she solidified HBR’s position as the primary source of trusted content for senior leaders. During her tenure, HBR won numerous awards and recognitions, including two National Magazine Award general excellence nominations. Bernstein is also the founding co-host of HBR’s award-winning Women at Work podcast, which recently celebrated its 10th season. Since 2020, she has also served as Vice President and Executive Editorial Director of Harvard Business Publishing, leading the editorial strategy and content development for HBP’s Corporate Learning and Higher Education businesses.

“I’m honored to lead the next chapter of HBR,” said Bernstein. “At a time when organizational leaders are facing extraordinary levels of complexity, HBR’s mission to provide the most relevant insights and evidence-backed guidance has never been more essential. I’m proud to lead an amazing team who will continue to innovate and deliver the high-quality content that our readers rely on to advance their companies and careers.”

Prior to joining HBR, Bernstein was Vice President, Global Thought Leadership at ManpowerGroup, and before that, she served as Executive Editor at PwC’s publication *strategy+business*. She also held senior editorial positions at *Business 2.0*, *The Industry Standard*, *Brill’s Content*, and *U.S. News & World Report.* She began her career at CBS News after receiving a degree in classics from Yale University.

In his role as Editor at Large, Ignatius will be launching HBR’s new offering for C-suite leaders. The project, aimed at helping senior leaders deal with the biggest business challenges of the moment, will launch in the second quarter.

“It has been a privilege to serve as Editor in Chief of HBR, and I am thrilled that the immensely talented Amy Bernstein is taking on the role,” said Ignatius. “In my new role leading our C-suite offering, my goal is to help leaders chart paths to success in what has become a particularly challenging business environment. We’ll be harnessing HBR’s deep understanding of the C-suite audience, along with our wealth of expertise, tools, and case studies, to help them tackle their toughest problems and anticipate what’s next.”
