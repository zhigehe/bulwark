**Alan Donze, CEO of Bioretec Ltd:**

For Bioretec, year 2024 was a great achievement as we managed to grow our net sales despite the delayed market approvals and significant investment in building out our U.S. infrastructure.  We took pivotal strides in the implementation of our strategy. We began our second phase of the RemeOs™ Trauma Screw launch in the U.S., which was supported with the recruitment of key members of the top management and the signing of new distribution and logistics agreements. We also updated our product development strategy and achieved milestones in market approval processes and patenting. To support our growth strategy and product development, we successfully raised EUR 6 million of new capital in November. Finally, in January 2025 we received the CE mark approval for RemeOs™ Trauma Screw product portfolio, a long-awaited milestone in our pursuit for expanded commercial growth.

In 2024, our net sales increased by 16 percent from the previous year, reaching EUR 4,5 million. The net sales consisted mainly of our Activa products, as the launch of RemeOs™ Trauma Screw in the U.S. is still ongoing and the CE mark approval allowing the launch in Europe was only received in January 2025. Our net sales in Europe increased by 46 percent and in the U.S. 30 percent, while the development in the rest of the world remained relatively stable.  Despite a slight dip in our sales margin influenced by China's volume-based procurement policies earlier this year, our margins improved during the last quarter of 2024 due to increased share of sales in the US.

The initial controlled launch of RemeOs™ Trauma Screws in the U.S. yielded excellent patient results and excellent post-healing follow-ups. This success established a strong foundation for entering the second phase of commercialization for RemeOs products in the U.S. In this phase, we will focus on expanding the distribution of the RemeOs™ Trauma Screw beyond the initial selected group of hospitals to a broader network. In addition to RemeOs products, we are also launching the Activa product line to the U.S. market.

To support these efforts, we successfully signed two important new cooperation agreements. In November, we entered into a new logistics agreement with GlobalMed Logistix (GMLx), a leader in healthcare logistics, that operates its own logistics center on the east coast of the United States with a has a nationwide network. This agreement ensures high service levels for customers throughout the U.S. market with seamless import and distribution of implants and instrument sets to hospitals. Additionally, we signed an important agreement with Tri-State Biologics (TSB), a leading distributor of medical and surgical products based in New Jersey. This partnership will enable the efficient sales and distribution of implants and instrument sets to hospitals in one of the most populated areas of the United States.

In addition to the commercial progress of the trauma screw, we are excited about the positive results of the RemeOs™ Spinal Interbody Cage, which received FDA's Breakthrough Device Designation status. To speed-up the commercialization of RemeOs™ Trauma Screw products and overall product development strategy, including the RemeOs™ Spinal Interbody Cage, we organized a successful and significantly oversubscribed share issue in November, raising EUR 6 million of funds. We were very pleased with the strong response to the share issue, which reflects the confidence investors have in our vision and strategy.

We are extremely pleased that in January 2025, we finally received the CE mark approval for RemeOs™ Trauma Screws, which not only allows immediate product launch in Europe, but also enables commercialization in non-European countries that recognize the CE mark. The CE mark received includes all RemeOs designs, and a broad indication set. The approval will accelerate the collection of real-world clinical evidence, which will enable the expansion of indications in the U.S., where the current approval is more limited.

With the receipt of the CE mark approval in 2025, we will focus on the launch of the full line of the RemeOs products to our customers and existing network of European distributors. In the U.S., we wait for new market approvals and maintain a focus on creating market demand with hospitals and surgeons as well as adding additional distributor partners for the U.S. infrastructure. To keep up with the growth and future potential, we will need to further scale up our manufacturing capacity and workforce. To accomplish these plans and achieve our target of generating positive cash flow from operating activities by the end of 2027, we anticipate requiring new funding in 2025.

In summary, I am extremely proud of our progress and excited about the unique opportunities that lie ahead. With the CE mark now received, we are entering a new phase in our growth strategy, and I have full trust in our capabilities to deliver the results. With the support of our dedicated personnel, owners and investors, we are well-positioned to achieve our growth targets and strengthen Bioretec's position as a leader in innovative medical solutions.

**Information about Bioretec**

Bioretec is a globally operating Finnish medical device company that continues to pioneer the application of absorbable orthopedic implants. The company has built unique competencies in the biological interface of active implants to enhance bone growth and accelerate fracture healing after orthopedic surgery. The products developed and manufactured by Bioretec are used worldwide in approximately 40 countries.

Bioretec is developing the new RemeOs™ product line based on a magnesium alloy and hybrid composite, introducing a new generation of strong absorbable materials for enhanced surgical outcomes. The RemeOs™ implants are absorbed and replaced by bone, which eliminates the need for removal surgery while facilitating fracture healing. The combination has the potential to make titanium implants redundant and help clinics reach their Value-Based Healthcare targets while focusing on value for patients through efficient healthcare. The first RemeOs™ product market authorization has been received in the U.S. in March 2023, and in Europe, the CE mark approval was received in January 2025. Bioretec is positioning itself to enter the addressable over USD 9 billion global orthopedic trauma and spine market and to become a game changer in surgical bone fracture treatment.
