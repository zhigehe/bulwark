Company's revenue falls short of Wall Street estimates as price increases were met with lower sales

Kraft Heinz Co.'s stock fell 3.2% Wednesday after the company warned it will miss analyst expectations for adjusted profit in 2025.

The food giant also said it faced a difficult 12 months in 2024, with unfavorable currency mixes, a slight loss in sales from businesses that it sold, and a decline in sales volumes - even as prices increased by 1.4%, mostly to mitigate higher input costs.

Some fresh CPI data on persistently high inflation also pushed the broad equities market down on the prospect of higher-for-longer prices.

Kraft Heinz's stock was one of the steepest decliners in the S&P 500 on Wednesday, but it gained back ground from a loss of 6% earlier in the day.

For the fourth quarter, Kraft Heinz's revenue dropped 4.1% to $6.58 billion from $6.86 billion, below the FactSet consensus estimate of $6.66 billion.

Kraft Heinz also cited "continued shifts in consumer behavior due to economic uncertainty" as well as a drop in its Lunchables packaged sandwiches and snacks.

"Although 2024 was a challenging year with our top line results coming in below our expectations, we remained disciplined in protecting profitability while driving industry-leading margins," Chief Executive Carlos Abrams-Rivera said in a prepared statement.

For 2025, Kraft Heinz (KHC) expects adjusted earnings of $2.63 a share to $2.74 a share, below the FactSet consensus estimate of $3.04 a share.

Kraft Heinz's adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of 84 cents a share beat the analyst estimate of 78 cents a share.

Including Wednesday's moves, Kraft Heinz's stock is down 6.7% in 2025, while the S&P 500 SPX is up by 3%.

"We are committed to making the necessary investments to drive top line improvement, while remaining disciplined," said Abrams-Rivera.

For full-year 2024, Kraft Heinz's revenue fell 3% to $25.85 billion, which is slightly below the FactSet consensus estimate of $25.93 billion. Kraft Heinz also returned $2.7 billion to stockholders in 2024.
