Gilbert, AZ, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The [National Academy of Sports Medicine](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h-yfWrJT5eWahpQjBmcUOv5T-DV5gmsCfClXs8BmeXJjEwLWT1azxiA0tT7yJuAMvxx7Ym6zKbd1vWiFKofjlxlCHMPf6rJpQW8Y8HNESSdWHSuo5mTRQAM-mHWbwcsp6MqOTAJLYULNNIslfMzGKVl_oFANL1H64TqWk0pfrc5CJzJ9-M258yarfOIwkoL3uuBMByQztNnPfcrelIcT4nSmIWaOAjGaEQEXEffzL7P3glxkm9Aeqx6JgLIQNJ8dHCIiR6FxuNhhbMSjmwt6h0mNFqhGuu0kRvU8ocu2R9M=)® (NASM), the global leader in fitness and wellness training and certifications, is launching its latest course, "*Understanding Weight Loss Medications: A Guide for Fitness and Wellness Professionals.*" This innovative course is designed to better equip fitness and wellness professionals with the insights and strategies needed to safely guide clients taking glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) medications towards improved health and well-being.

Weight loss medications, including the widely recognized GLP-1 and GIP agonists, have become a popular solution for managing obesity in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. As explored in the course “*Understanding the Weight Loss Medications: A Guide for Fitness and Wellness Professionals*”, [recent reports](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q8qjv3ikZ7X9PQBbJ6YEAhjiYBJ2aptd96K6QD-O9VQa0k29Q9JdRseGX8BrR6qdoFIggYIViz7xQZ77M9x-eIKA-LJkaziyGy7ebwduidUW_I6kIgFmsWXsZOkcR3YGOe2KCgc5BzTNmTF33grR220dQOULKx6HKsYCfFDW-Qe1i4crsdyIiOsziS_fmo94iZ--ZjwnSBz-k1RDN0QAQD_s_jX7I3X7IW5mbPM83vB6h_k7_AwtGz_G5vtowrueMgIoeYr-GjJ6NYKMx8KiZK5ekVTT80k7AL0ITYZAuPs=) suggest that between 8-12% of U.S. adults have used a GLP-1 agonist – with 6% currently taking the medication, it is evident that these drugs play a significant role in the healthcare landscape.

"We recognize the growing prevalence of GLP-1/GIP medications in use by exercising populations and believe it's imperative for fitness and wellness professionals to be well-informed about these drugs," said Mike Fantigrassi, Head of Product at NASM. "Our new course provides the necessary knowledge and tools to ensure that professionals can offer comprehensive support, including exercise guidance tailored to the unique needs of clients on these medications. Understanding the interplay between GLP-1/GIP medications and exercise is crucial for fostering a safe and effective path towards sustainable health and wellness."

The evidence-based course explores the latest developments surrounding GLP-1/GIP medications, covering both currently approved drugs and those undergoing FDA clinical trials. Participants will gain insights into the latest research on [semaglutide](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1YEz_bgYjm0U957NMWd7kn6LKccgnT-oiMvIpigZkc9HHV4p1CThpSqigqOatUb1b-mNydfZRZ2BRjjx8ci6jL2UdIJLbgZ00D0AkFMtRLTr8BYJri0Ov_M9sN-A4mYl) and [tirzepatide](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WCAJ6QRGY9UQ6JiYuxG2bK76vUZHvK344HNhJOTgO11AsdhzFKr2VdwjeL8CAv6z76r0-T6FzUVRpSwihEqb29v6-egox0gwfLXkrIJ9LRtOFYrr6Z2dWMpUZYR1u_r-), including their drug actions, potential side effects, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and implications for weight loss.
