FRANKLIN, Tenn., Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- [Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358684-1&h=1159435798&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mitsubishicars.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Dmedia-mitsu%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dnew_2025_mitsubishi_outlander_priced%26utm_content%3Dtm3_____&a=Mitsubishi+Motors+North+America%2C+Inc.) (MMNA) today announced starting pricing for the new 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander, the brand's flagship SUV. Updated styling and revised engineering highlight the mid-cycle refresh on the award-winning Outlander, with the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $29,6451 for a front-wheel-drive ES model, continued proof of Mitsubishi Motors' legendary value story.

More information on the vehicle can be seen at [www.2025Outlander.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4358684-1&h=584752544&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2025outlander.com%2F&a=www.2025Outlander.com), and full pricing will be announced on February 24, 2025.

Since winning multiple industry awards and the hearts of customers alike, Outlander moves into 2025 with updates to drivability, interior and exterior styling and features, and an industry-leading in-car entertainment system developed by the audio experts at Yamaha2.  Mitsubishi Motors engineers targeted the areas in which Outlander already excelled – its award-winning interior and acclaimed handling – to raise the vehicle's profile even further.

"The new 2025 Outlander is bold, powerful, strong, and stands out on the road, all while delivering the value that customers expect from Mitsubishi Motors," said Mark Chaffin, MMNA president and CEO. "Since the launch of this generation of Outlander in 2021, the vehicle has been key to Mitsubishi Motors' successes here in the U.S. and around the world.  When we add that to Mitsubishi Motors' industry-leading warranty coverage, two years of included limited maintenance4, and our award-winning dealer-partner network, Outlander is more than just a great value, it's a great vehicle."

Starting with the interior, upgraded and redesigned materials bring Outlander even closer to the luxury class, with the addition of sound deadening material in significant areas bringing about a reduction of more than 0.5dB in road noise and nearly 6dB in overall sound isolation compared to the 2024 model. Redesigned placement and sizing of the cupholders, a more functional area for wireless mobile phone charging, and a larger armrest/center console area with more storage also raise Outlander's game.

Underneath, Outlander sees a recalibrated power steering system delivering more precise steering feel, while recalibrated springs, shock absorbers and stabilizer bars bring greater assurance in driving confidence.

The emphasis for this updated vehicle is on refinement, on details, and on enhancing the driver's and passengers' experience. Outlander has consistently broken U.S. sales records since the launch of the revised model in 2021, including a best-ever annual sales performance in the U.S. in 20243.

Value is a Mitsubishi Motors hallmark, especially when considering the amount of equipment offered as standard on every 2025 Outlander: three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, full LED lighting inside and out, frameless auto-dimming mirror, 12.3" navigation screen with HD Traffic Information, Yamaha® audio with wireless Apple® CarPlay and Android AutoTM 5, USB-C power ports, multi-zone automatic climate control, and a full suite of driver-alert and safety features. All models are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a constant velocity transmission (CVT) with eight-speed sport mode.

Every 2025 Mitsubishi vehicle comes with one of the industry's leading warranties: a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty6; 5-year/60,000-mile new vehicle limited warranty7; 7-year/100,000-mile anti-corrosion/perforation limited warranty8; and 5-year/unlimited mileage roadside assistance program.9
