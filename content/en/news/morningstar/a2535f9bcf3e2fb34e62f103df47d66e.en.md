PASADENA, CALIF., Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LIXTE Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. (“LIXTE” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LIXT and LIXTW), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 434,784 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $2.415 per share. In addition, in a concurrent private placement, the Company issued unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 434,784 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.29 per share and are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance.

H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $1,050,000, before deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The shares of common stock (but not the warrants issued in the private placement or the shares of common stock underlying such warrants) were offered by the Company pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278874) originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 23, 2024 and became effective on May 2, 2024. The registered direct offering of the shares of common stock was only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective registration statement. The prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the shares of common stock being offered in the registered direct offering have been filed with the SEC and be available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the registered direct offering may also be obtained by contacting H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC at 430 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10022, by telephone at (212) 856-5711 or e-mail at [placements@hcwco.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kiS7p55zzW-wdAo6Nh4vtvIkeXs4WZJkVcqJxmQno0VPCTfPmcCiFlrkJjlMCjJ-po4-rbvhRB4fmUYRuVraLy_yKRwtMknxxXY9lpXHXfc=).

The warrants described above were issued in a concurrent private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the warrants and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
