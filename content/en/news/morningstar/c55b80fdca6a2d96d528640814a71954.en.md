Lauren Lung, director of commercial sales at Epson, joins CRN's 2025 Channel Chiefs list.

As director of commercial sales, Lung leads the end-user sales teams across North America for Epson. Lauren joined Epson in 2016 as a sales manager responsible for enterprise client sales in North America. Shortly thereafter, she assumed responsibility for business inkjet sales and extended Epson's reach into Canadian markets. In 2019, Lung was promoted to director, commercial sales. With a focus on retail, hospitality, banking, corporate enterprises, and education sectors, Lung and her team remain committed to fostering long-term partnerships built on openness, trust and mutual success.

"Integrity and partnerships are at the core of Epson's success and I'm honored, along with my team, to be recognized for our efforts in empowering partners to deliver outstanding service to their customers," said Lung. "We view each partner as an extension to the Epson team and are deeply committed to working closely with them to ensure their success. When they thrive, so do we."

The Channel Chiefs list, released annually by CRN, showcases the top leaders throughout the IT channel ecosystem who work tirelessly to ensure mutual success with their partners and customers.

Over the past year, Lung and her team collaborated closely with partners to introduce a new program designed to drive mutual success. By positioning Epson's diverse solutions as an integrated ecosystem, they successfully expanded into new vertical markets, boosting customer engagement and sales. This program is now in its second year and off to a solid start. Epson also supported partners with increased product reach through demo programs and regional events, effectively educating end users about the latest offerings. Additionally, in response to limited budgets in the education sector, Lung's team worked with partners to sell solutions to customers that are cost-effective, highly reliable, easy to use with advanced functionality, which in turn help partners sell more products while simplifying technology integration and the end-user experience.

"This year's honorees exemplify dedication, innovation, and leadership that supports solution provider success and fosters growth across the channel," said Jennifer Follett, VP, U.S. Content, and Executive Editor, CRN, at The Channel Company. "Each of these exceptional leaders has made a lasting channel impact by championing partnerships and designing creative strategies that get results. They've set a high bar in the channel, and we're thrilled to recognize their standout achievements."
