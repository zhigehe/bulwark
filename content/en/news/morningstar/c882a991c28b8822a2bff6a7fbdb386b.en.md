**The Allegations:** Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Cardlytics, Inc. (CDLX) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) increasing consumer engagement led to an increase in consumer incentives; (2) that the Company could not increase its billings commensurate with the increased consumer engagement; (3) that, as a result, there was a significant risk that its revenue growth would slow or decline; and (4) that the changes to the Company's Ad Decision Engine, which led to increased consumer engagement, led to the "underdelivery" of budgets and customers billing estimates.

On August 7, 2024, Cardlytics released its second quarter 2024 financial results, revealing a 9% year-over-year decrease in revenue to $69.6 million, alongside a 3% decline in adjusted contribution to $36.4 million. Cardlytics also announced that its CEO had stepped down from the Board of Directors. On this news, the Company's stock price fell $3.94, or 57.1%, to close at $2.96 per share on August 8, 2024.
