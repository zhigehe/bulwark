Together, Infomedia and Intellegam will redefine solutions for OEMs, dealerships, and vehicle owners – **making insights smarter, operations faster, and customer experiences more meaningful.**

**Transaction Summary**

The purchase price of ~A$10 million is split between cash and Infomedia shares and will be paid over two years. ~A$2m of the consideration will be invested directly into Intellegam to provide the business with working capital.

The agreement provides Infomedia with the pathway to acquire the remaining 50% of Intellegam over five years, subject to the achievement of defined financial and strategic hurdles.

The future valuations of Intellegam are linked to both revenues and profitability and are capped at appropriate levels that ensure the dual objectives of providing incentives for the selling shareholders of Intellegam and financial certainty to Infomedia.

**Strategic Highlights**

* Intellegam has developed –  
  o   a proprietary B2B generative AI technology already used by two Chinese OEM brands in Europe. This product leverages Intellegam's innovative AI capability to enhance repair data interpretation and customer experience  
  o   a unique and scalable IP across the entire AI value chain including data capture, data structuring, search, agent orchestration framework, customized LLM and UI/UX integration
* Intellegam's technologies will be integrated into Infomedia's core product suite and together with Infomedia's rich data assets, will enable Infomedia to offer additional AI features and functionality to cross- and upsell to its existing customer base
* Intellegam's management team is highly incentivised to develop and grow the combined business over the coming 5 years
* Not expected to have a material impact on FY25 P&L
