**Union: Houston once again investing in private profits**

While we understand that Nova Scotians are struggling with lack of access to mental health and addiction support, CUPE Nova Scotia does not believe that selling more of our health care to private companies is a solution.

“There’s no doubt that Nova Scotians need improved and expanded access to mental health services,” said CUPE Nova Scotia President Nan McFadgen, “but why are we investing this money in private, for-profit companies instead of the already existing mental health services run by our public health care system?”

“The workers are at the end of their rope,” said CUPE 8920 President Dianne Frittenburg “Mental health workers province-wide are overwhelmed. There just isn’t enough time in the day to help everyone. They’ve been asking for help only to be told that the much-needed support is going to private businesses instead.”

The Houston government’s announcement specifically outlined that public money, meaning tax dollars paid by everyday Nova Scotians, would be used to fund private-sector professionals. They committed to hiring 50 clinicians in the first phase with an end goal of 250 in two years. All 250 would come from the private sector.

“I can’t imagine there are 250 clinicians in Nova Scotia in the private sector that are able to take on more patients right now,” continued Frittenburg, “which means these clinicians are either going to be taken from the public sector or be brought in from other provinces and countries. That is not a solution and leaves our current mental health workers high and dry.”

“We’ve seen this before. Government promises to expand a public service but instead of investing in our public system, they invest in private companies and our province suffers. Companies are invested in their bottom line, not the health of Nova Scotians,” said McFadgen. “Houston might claim there is no cost, but there is. We’ve already paid for this with our tax dollars.”

Historically, public-private partnerships, or P3s, are initially less expensive as bids for the new tender are purposefully kept low. However, in the long run, P3s end up costing both the government and the taxpayer more money for a lower quality of service than a functional public system.

“If Houston really wants to help, he has to invest in our public health care system. That’s what will help Nova Scotians, not lining some CEO’s pockets with our hard-earned tax dollars,” finished McFadgen.
