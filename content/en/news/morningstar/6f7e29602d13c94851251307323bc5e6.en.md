COLUMBIA, Mo., Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Artificial intelligence is making its way into one of life's biggest financial decisions. About 1-in-3 prospective homebuyers (32%) are using AI tools as part of their homebuying journey, according to a [survey](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4360513-1&h=2564970750&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.veteransunited.com%2Feducation%2Fai-homebuying-survey%2F&a=survey) released today by Veterans United Home Loans, the nation's largest VA lender.

The nationwide survey of nearly 900 prospective buyers found that searching for and virtually touring homes are the two most common uses of AI.

The survey also revealed that 40% of prospective buyers interact with AI once a day or more.  However, they were split on how comfortable they are with this technology becoming a part of everyday life, with 31% more concerned than excited, 29% more excited than concerned and 28% equally excited and concerned.

"With digital assistants and smart home devices gaining broader adoption in everyday life, AI tools are becoming a valuable resource for home shoppers," said Chris Birk, vice president of mortgage insight at Veterans United. "However, some buyers need balance – leveraging AI as a helpful tool while maintaining the human touch to guide and reassure buyers through life's biggest investments."

**Searching and touring homes are the most popular tools homebuyers use**Today, most home shoppers start their home search online. The survey shows nearly 40% of buyers are using AI to both find and view homes.

At 38%, searching for homes for sale in the location they want to live ranked as the most common way home shoppers used AI. This was followed closely by virtual home tours, which were used by 37% of those who reported using AI tools.

**Buyers find AI can help to educate and dream**About a third of buyers who use AI tools (32%) use them to estimate monthly payments or to check property values. About the same percentage (31%) use AI as a mortgage calculator to determine how much they could afford or be preapproved for; for tips and tricks to make homebuying easier; and to learn about the latest housing trends.

Nearly 3-in-10 use AI to input specific criteria they are looking for in a home to find available homes (29%) and to shop for the best mortgage rates (28%).

The survey also found that 27% of respondents used AI to visualize potential renovations or changes to a home.

**Who's using AI**The survey revealed that younger home shoppers are more likely to use AI than their older counterparts, which suggests this emerging technology could play an even larger role in the process as younger generations reach homebuying age.

Among those who use AI once a day or more, 60% are Gen Z and 47% are millennials. Just over a third of Gen X (36%) and 18% of baby boomers reported using AI once a day or more.
