**Heineken Holding N.V. announces first tranche of its share buyback programme**

| Press release |
| --- |

Amsterdam, 13 February 2025 – Heineken Holding N.V. [(EURONEXT:HEIO; OTCQX: HKHHY)] announces the start of the first up to circa €375 million tranche of its up to circa €750 million two-year share buyback programme, as communicated on 12 February 2025.   
Heineken Holding N.V. will use the proceeds of its pro rata participation in the Heineken N.V. share buyback programme to repurchase, on a daily basis, a number of Heineken Holding N.V shares equal to the number of Heineken N.V. shares that Heineken Holding N.V. will sell to Heineken N.V. The Heineken N.V. shares will be sold by Heineken Holding N.V. for the price of the volume-weighted average price of the shares acquired by Heineken N.V. on market on the relevant day. Heineken N.V. and Heineken Holding N.V. have entered into an arrangement to ensure Heineken Holding N.V.'s participation in Heineken N.V.'s share buyback programme is implemented in conformity with Heineken Holding N.V.'s articles of association.  
The first tranche of the Heineken Holding N.V’s share buyback programme is expected to complete no later than 30 January 2026, or so much earlier as the amount dedicated to the first tranche has been spent, barring unforeseen circumstances. Repurchased shares will be cancelled to reduce Heineken Holding N.V.’s issued share capital. The share buyback programme may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time.  
The programme will be executed within the existing authority granted in the 25 April 2024 Heineken Holding N.V. Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and the authority granted by future general meetings of Heineken Holding N.V.   
L'Arche Green N.V., Heineken Holding N.V.'s majority shareholder, is supportive of the share buyback programme and as such has irrevocably undertaken to vote in favour of any requested share buyback and share cancellation mandates in relation to the announced programme at future general meetings of Heineken Holding N.V. L'Arche Green N.V. remains strongly committed as Heineken Holding N.V.’s long-term majority shareholder and will not participate in the programme.   
The programme will be executed in compliance with the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (as amended, “Market Abuse Regulation”), including compliance with the safe harbour provisions for share buybacks.   
Heineken Holding N.V. will inform the market of the progress of the programme through regular press releases and updates on its website ([www.heinekenholding.com/investors)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-znPQFLwLsg4U3frd8ixCwkGjbXJkSp_kdQnp1wONLIRuBkThWXz_3Xu-ZFs-5HGor0B5Bjgye0K272nGR3JP-jzLXME5HJNJoYfK1lJ0z2hmo9tzcjXiUJFGTZLMKlcz6GXKUgQ--5AWde7z6TaCg==).
