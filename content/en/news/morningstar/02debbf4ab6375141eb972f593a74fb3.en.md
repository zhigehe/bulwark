**GSK INVESTOR ALERT: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC Announces that GSK plc Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit**

Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against GSK plc (“GSK” or “the Company”) (NYSE: GSK) and certain of its officers.

**Class Definition**

This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired GSK American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) between February 5, 2020 and August 14, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: [bgandg.com/GSK](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbgandg.com%2FGSK&esheet=54200189&newsitemid=20250209330158&lan=en-US&anchor=bgandg.com%2FGSK&index=1&md5=289bcc59d8d4e96decfdb76ad405baa1).

**Case Details**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, and specifically: (1) Defendants represented to investors that GSK removed Zantac from the market “[b]ased on information available at the time and correspondence with regulators,” and that GSK was “continuing with investigations into the potential source of NDMA;” (2) Defendants assured investors that “GSK, the FDA, and the EMA [European Medicines Agency] have all independently concluded that there is no evidence of a causal association between ranitidine therapy and the development of cancer in patients,” findings that were “consistent with other ranitidine data published prior to 2019;” and (3) Defendants claimed that they could not “quantify or reliably estimate the liability” GSK could face from Zantac-related legal proceedings.

**What's Next?**

A class action lawsuit has already been filed.
