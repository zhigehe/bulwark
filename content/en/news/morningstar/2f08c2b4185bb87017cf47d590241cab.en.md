NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TwentyOneVC today announced the launch of its crypto arbitrage service, designed to help traders capitalize on price variations across digital asset markets. This new service reflects the firm’s ongoing efforts to provide structured investment solutions in response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

“Arbitrage changed the investment space since it was incorporated in 2020, and it’s now even more important with the changes in the crypto market. As volatility increases, arbitrage provides investors with a structured method to adjust their portfolios,” said Tony Wiessman, Managing Director at [TwentyOneVC](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qakewJSAs9eceDL7J3lejKjsbVvHMgtw8W00bRc7iWAMC5TIrWtqenuAaZLdr3kowxB0MsPRtaPqymB3kl8qCg==).

**Enhancing Market Access Through Arbitrage**

Arbitrage has long been used in financial markets to take advantage of price differences. In the fast-moving cryptocurrency sector, these opportunities arise frequently. TwentyOneVC’s service is designed to help investors identify and act on these price gaps efficiently by integrating automated trading tools and real-time data analysis. The platform enables precise execution while helping users manage market risks.

“Our goal is to create a seamless trading experience where investors can execute arbitrage opportunities with confidence,” said Tony Wiessman. “By automating trade execution and ensuring real-time monitoring, we aim to eliminate inefficiencies that often prevent traders from capitalizing on market gaps.”

**Technology-Driven Execution and Risk Management**

The firm incorporates automated execution tools and built-in safeguards to help traders respond quickly while mitigating unnecessary exposure to volatility.

“With crypto markets evolving rapidly, having the right tools in place is essential,” added Tony Wiessman. “We’ve built a system that not only identifies arbitrage opportunities but also executes them in a way that minimizes risk for traders.”
