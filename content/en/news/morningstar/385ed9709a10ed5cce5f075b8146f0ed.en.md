**Hightower Advisors Announces Larry Restieri as Chief Executive Officer**

**Restieri to Succeed Bob Oros in Planned Leadership Transition**

[Hightower Advisors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhightoweradvisors.com%2Findex.html&esheet=54203623&newsitemid=20250211754262&lan=en-US&anchor=Hightower+Advisors&index=1&md5=3c7fd16871794a0d3f47b2ce3c63b3ad), a leading wealth management firm that provides investment, financial, and retirement planning services to individuals, foundations, and family offices, as well as 401(k) consulting and cash management services to corporations, today announced that Larry Restieri will become its next Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and a member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), effective in spring 2025. Restieri will succeed Bob Oros, who has served as Hightower’s CEO since 2019. Oros will remain a member of the Board, ensuring strategic continuity and a seamless transition for the firm’s growing client base.

Restieri brings extensive experience in wealth management, having served most recently as CEO of AYCO, a Goldman Sachs company, which specializes in workplace financial planning and private wealth advisory services. During his tenure, he played a key role in modernizing the firm’s offerings and deepening its client relationships. Prior to leading AYCO, Restieri spent more than two decades at Goldman Sachs in a variety of leadership roles, focusing on wealth and asset management.

The planned succession marks Hightower’s entrance into its next phase of growth, building on the firm’s transformation and expansion under Oros, who oversaw more than 50 M&A transactions, including the addition of NEPC, a leading investment consultant and outsourced chief investment officer, and grew assets under advisement from $57B to $1.8T.

“I am honored and excited to join Hightower at this pivotal moment,” said Restieri. “Under Bob’s leadership, the firm has built an incredible reputation as a leading partner for independent advisors, providing them with the tools and resources needed to succeed. I look forward to working with the talented Hightower team, our advisors, and the Board, including Bob.”

“Larry is an exceptional leader who brings deep familiarity with the wealth management landscape and a strong commitment to serving advisors and their clients,” said Oros. “I am incredibly proud of the progress we’ve made at Hightower over the past six years, and I have full confidence that under Larry’s leadership, the firm will continue to thrive. I look forward to supporting him and the Hightower team as a board member and advisor.”

“Bob has been an outstanding leader, guiding Hightower through a period of transformational growth, and we thank him for all of his contributions,” said Ganesh Rao, Managing Director and head of Financial Technology and Services at THL Partners, the firm’s majority investor. “We are excited to welcome Larry as the next CEO of Hightower. Larry has an extensive understanding of the wealth management industry and a proven track record of success in building businesses. We look forward to partnering with Larry on Hightower’s continued growth and evolution under his leadership.”
