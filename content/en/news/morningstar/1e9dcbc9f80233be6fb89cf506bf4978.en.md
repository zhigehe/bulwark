By Pierre Bertrand

Sanofi said it would discontinue its phase 3 clinical trial for an E. Coli vaccine after a review by an independent data monitoring committee.

The French pharma company said the scheduled review found that the vaccine wasn't sufficiently effective in preventing invasive E. coli disease.

"No safety signals related to the vaccine candidate were identified and, throughout the study, investigators ensured that participants who developed IED received prompt treatment and care," Sanofi said.

The vaccine was being developed in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson & Johnson company. The study was initiated in June 2021, Sanofi said.

Sanofi said it has booked a $250 million pretax impairment charge in its results for the fourth quarter last year for halting the study. It added that there was no change to its financial guidance for 2025.
