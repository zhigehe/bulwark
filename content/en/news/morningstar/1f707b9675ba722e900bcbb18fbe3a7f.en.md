"Prenups are not about planning for divorce—they're about building trust, setting expectations, and protecting both partners," says Andrews. "Valentine's Day is the perfect opportunity to have these conversations because it's all about love and creating a strong foundation for your future."

**What is a Prenup?**

A prenuptial agreement is a legal document that outlines how assets, debts, and other financial matters will be handled in the event of divorce or death. While some couples assume prenups are only for the wealthy, Andrews explains that they can benefit couples from all walks of life.

"Prenups are especially important for couples entering a marriage with significant assets, family-owned businesses, or children from previous relationships," Andrews explains. "But even for couples with modest means, a prenup can provide clarity and peace of mind."

**Three Reasons to Consider a Prenup**

1. **Financial Transparency** – A prenup fosters open and honest communication about finances. "It's an opportunity to discuss each partner's assets, debts, and financial goals before marriage," Andrews notes. "This transparency can strengthen trust and prevent misunderstandings later."
2. **Protecting Individual and Shared Assets** – A prenup ensures that both partners' individual and shared assets are clearly defined and protected. "It's not about mistrust—it's about making thoughtful decisions while emotions are calm," Andrews says.
3. **Safeguarding the Future** – For couples with children from previous relationships or family-owned businesses, a prenup can outline provisions that protect their interests. "It's a way to ensure your loved ones are cared for in any eventuality," she adds.

**Advice for Couples Considering a Prenup**

For those wondering whether a prenup is the right choice, Andrews offers the following guidance:

1. **Start the Conversation Early** – "Don't wait until the last minute to bring up a prenup," Andrews advises. "These discussions should happen well before the wedding, giving both partners time to reflect and consult with legal professionals."
2. **Focus on Collaboration** – "Approach the conversation as a partnership," she says. "A prenup should reflect mutual respect and shared goals, not one-sided demands."
3. **Seek Professional Guidance** – Andrews emphasizes the importance of consulting an experienced family law attorney. "An attorney can help you draft a prenup that's legally sound, fair, and tailored to your unique circumstances," she explains.

Through her **Talk to Tiffany** approach, Tiffany L. Andrews empowers couples to take control of their financial and legal futures. "A prenup is not about planning for the worst—it's about protecting your love story and the life you're building together," says Andrews.
