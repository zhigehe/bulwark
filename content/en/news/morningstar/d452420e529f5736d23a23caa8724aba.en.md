DSM-Firmenich is selling its 50% stake in the Feed Enzymes Alliance to its partner Novonesis for 1.5 billion euros ($1.55 billion).

The Dutch nutrition, health and bioscience company said Tuesday that it expects to receive net proceeds of 1.4 billion euros from the sale, which will be booked as a profit in its accounts once the deal closes.

The sale is expected to close this year, subject to conditions and regulatory approvals, DSM said.

DSM said the business is part of the animal nutrition and health business unit, which is being separated from the group as announced last February.

On Feb. 15, 2024, DSM said it was separating its animal nutrition and health business from the group and focusing on nutrition, health, and beauty to better drive growth.

"We are on track with the fine-tuning of our portfolio and next week we will begin the process of seeking transaction options to exit the animal nutrition and health business from the group over the course of 2025," Chief Executive Dimitri de Vreeze said.
