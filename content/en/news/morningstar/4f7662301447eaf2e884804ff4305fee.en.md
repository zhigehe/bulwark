ArcBest has also expanded its existing technologies, the Vaux Freight Movement System™ and Vaux Smart Autonomy™, enhancing their value for customers across various industries, including verticals like data centers, automotive, manufacturing, retail and air cargo.

**About Vaux Vision**

Vaux Vision is 3D perception technology designed to streamline material handling by providing precise, real-time freight measurement and insight directly on a forklift. With sensors placed strategically on the forklift that activate upon picking up the freight, the technology captures dimensions, images, and deep shipment insight on the go, identifying revenue opportunities and enhancing operational efficiencies without disrupting workflow. Operators receive real-time feedback on a tablet, and data is stored securely in the cloud. The technology can handle freight of various shapes and sizes, not limited to standard pallets.

Vaux Vision is NTEP (National Type Evaluation Program) certified and features a touch screen operator display and barcode scanning capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with the Vaux OS as well as new or existing weight scales. Other capabilities include:

* Capturing photos of freight during pick and drop to improve visibility and transparency
* Utilizing AI to determine attributes like damage, HazMat, stackable, fragile and leaning
* Tracking the piece ID or pallet barcode

“Our culture of continuous innovation ensures we’re always finding new ways to enhance and expand the value that Vaux provides,” said Dennis Anderson, chief innovation officer at ArcBest. “Accurate freight dimensions have become increasingly important, but standard static dimensioners can be cost-prohibitive and inefficient for many businesses. With its low barrier to entry and ease of implementation, Vaux Vision offers a flexible solution to this challenge. The pilot phase of Vaux Vision will give us critical insights as we refine the technology and ensure it delivers significant value.”

**Updates to Existing Vaux Technology**

In addition to Vaux Vision, ArcBest also announced updates to its previously released solutions, introducing more equipment sizes and performance enhancements. These updates were driven by customer feedback across several customer verticals.

**New Vaux Freight Movement System Equipment Options**

The Vaux Freight Movement System was the first iteration of the Vaux Technology suite, designed to improve material handling efficiency by reimagining trailer loading and unloading using our mobile platform, the Vaux MP. Freight is loaded onto the Vaux MP outside the trailer, and using a standard forklift equipped with an MP Coupler, easily slides into the trailer. To unload, the forklift and coupler can pull the entire MP out of the trailer in one movement, allowing for easy maneuvering to the optimal location in the warehouse for rapid processing. The Vaux MP is available in multiple sizes and types and features a built-in decking system that can be configured thousands of ways based on shipment needs. This flexibility allows trailers to be fully loaded, even with products that cannot be stacked — reducing the number of trucks on the road and positively impacting environmental sustainability metrics. New equipment options available with the Vaux Freight Movement System include:

* A new MP decking system configuration that enables stacking of previously unstackable freight, such as high-value server equipment for data centers
* A 26-foot and 10-foot Roller Deck MP for air cargo ULD containers
* An Automotive Hauler that enables a standard trailer to transport up to four vehicles
* A Max Width MP to handle wide freight and a 17-foot MP designed for tight spaces

**Vaux Smart Autonomy Capability Updates**

One year after launching the Vaux MP, ArcBest announced Vaux Smart Autonomy to enhance safety and efficiency in material handling and address customers’ labor challenges. Vaux Smart Autonomy combines autonomous mobile robot (AMR) forklifts and reach trucks with fleet management software and teleoperation capabilities to automate material handling while keeping a human operator involved for tasks that require a human touch. This collaboration between teleoperators and autonomous technology makes warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial facilities safer and more efficient. Vaux Smart Autonomy is flexible out of the box, adapting to variability in warehouse conditions, products and processes, without significant infrastructure changes.

Vaux has expanded its 5K counterbalance forklift capabilities to now handle trailer loading and unloading. With its unique design, Vaux Smart Autonomy can manage double-stacked freight in trailers and then seamlessly perform autonomous put-away operations.

It also now supports:

* Managing the autonomous movement of freight that is larger than a standard pallet
* Stacking on gravity feeds and bulk stacking
* Moving automotive racks, rack replenishment and rack pick
* Trailer load and unload, including double-stacked freight

Working in customer environments has informed Vaux advancement, and its forklifts have significantly ramped the number of successful autonomous missions completed in the last twelve months. In addition, the company’s Innovation Warehouse plays a pivotal role in the development and testing of this new technology. It provides a high-tech, real-world environment for R&D teams to ideate, test and iterate on new solutions. The space mirrors the diverse operational settings of the company’s customers, allowing for faster, more effective development cycles and ensuring that products meet real-world needs.

“Early adopters of the technology have seen substantial productivity improvements and reduced damage costs and emissions. We’re excited to see these enhancements make an even bigger impact in the coming months,” said Anderson. “With these latest updates, we’re empowering our customers to work smarter and achieve their goals more efficiently. Our teams are already working on the next generation of technology, and we remain committed to delivering solutions that are not only powerful but also tailored to the unique needs of our customers.”
