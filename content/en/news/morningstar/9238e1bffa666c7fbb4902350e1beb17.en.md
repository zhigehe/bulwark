Inspire Medical Systems said it is cooperating with U.S. Justice Department probe of allegations into allegations of false claims related to its Inspire system apnea implant.

Shares fall 5.5% to $171 in post-market trading. Through Monday's close, the stock has dropped 7.8% over the past 12 months.

The developer of products for obstructive sleep apnea on Jan. 17 received a civil investigative demand from the Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota concerning allegations of false claims, including false claims arising from violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, submitted to government payors in connection with its implant, the company said Monday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The civil investigative demand has requested information relating to the marketing, promotion, and reimbursement practices associated with its products, it said.
