With over 100,000 visitors expected to descend on New Orleans to see the Kansas City Chiefs defend their title against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Orleans Parish Communication District (OPCD) is prepared for the influx of emergency calls that such big events bring.

By implementing Carbyne technology, OPCD 9-1-1 call takers and dispatchers benefit from state-of-the-art emergency response capabilities, ensuring quicker and more effective assistance for visitors and residents during this major event.

Tools include:

* Smart triaging - prioritizing emergencies for faster response
* Precise caller location - pinpointing exact locations for quicker, more accurate dispatch
* AI-powered translation and transcription - breaking language barriers in real-time
* Live video to 9-1-1 - giving dispatchers real-time eyes on the scene

OPCD is dedicated to providing the best emergency services to everyone in New Orleans – visitors and residents alike.

"Here at OPCD we are laser-focused and committed to ensuring we have the best technology available to serve the residents, visitors, and public safety personnel in New Orleans," said OPCD Executive Director Karl Fasold. "We and our Public Safety Partners are using every tool in our toolbelt to ensure the safety of all during the The Big Game and beyond. By leveraging Carbyne's APEX tools, OPCD has access to the most advanced location information, multimedia capabilities, and translation services available through 9-1-1.  In addition, the cloud-native nature of APEX provides resiliency and reliability that can't be achieved with traditional telephony systems.
