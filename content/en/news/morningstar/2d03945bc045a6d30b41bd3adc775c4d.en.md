On February 5, 2025, Skyworks released its first quarter 2025 financial results, reporting a greater than anticipated decline in quarterly revenue. Skyworks also disclosed that its “content position is expected to be down 20% to 25%” with its “largest customer” which “will start impacting [the Company’s] revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘25, and throughout fiscal ‘26.” The Company explained it “didn’t get a single source” deal “on one important part.”

On this news, Skyworks’ stock price fell $21.48, or 24.7%, to close at $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, thereby injuring investors.
