iQmetrix has repeatedly been honored in this awards category due to its incredible working culture, its focus on self-management and autonomy, and its extensive range of employee benefits that include comprehensive healthcare coverage, trusted “take-what-you-need” vacation leave, and trusted sick days.

"We see the competition winners adapting to reflect how Canada is changing," said Kristina Leung, managing editor of the Canada's Top Employers project, which runs both the nationwide recognition program and the province-specific rankings. "The best employers recognize that traditional benefits—such as paid time off for religious holidays, medical and health benefits, or even cultural events organized for employees—need to reflect the nation as it is today, not how it might have been when these programs were created."

Now in its 20th year, BC’s Top Employers is a special designation of Canada’s Top Employers, a national awards program operated by Mediacorp, which recognizes employers that lead their industries in offering exceptional workplaces. Employers are compared to other organizations in their field to determine which offer the most progressive and forward-thinking programs. All companies in Canada are eligible to enter, and the results are divided by provincial and specialty rankings, in addition to the overall nationwide top 100 listing.

Employers are evaluated on eight criteria, which have remained consistent since the project’s inception. These criteria are:

* workplace;
* work atmosphere and social;
* health, financial, and family benefits;
* vacation and time off;
* employee communications;
* performance management;
* training and skills development;
* and community involvement.

Marni Aubichon, Interim Lead of People and Culture at iQmetrix, said, “At iQmetrix, we're incredibly proud of our [award-winning workplace culture](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iqmetrix.com%2Fnews%2Fiqmetrix-honored-as-one-of-north-americas-top-50-inspiring-workplaces%23entry%3A218660%401%3Aurl&esheet=54201398&newsitemid=20250211810602&lan=en-US&anchor=award-winning+workplace+culture&index=3&md5=d13e99aa0b8dd9bf013ba5ee6edb32e1), built on self-management principles that empower every employee to bring their true selves to work and excel in their careers.
