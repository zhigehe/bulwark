**AM Best Assigns Issue Credit Rating to CSAA Insurance Exchange’s New Surplus Notes**

**AM Best** has assigned a Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “a-” (Excellent) to the $500 million, 8.125% surplus notes, due February 2045, issued by CSAA Insurance Exchange (CSAA) (Walnut Creek, CA). The outlook assigned to this Credit Rating (rating) is negative.

The surplus notes are intended to support the company’s capital in anticipation of further premium growth and provide an additional layer of protection for catastrophic events, as well as enhance CSAA’s financial flexibility. Following the surplus notes issuance, the financial leverage at CSAA will be well within AM Best’s guidelines for the rating and the interest coverage is expected to be strong.

The notes are callable at par any time after 10 years from the issue date, in whole or in part, with 30 days prior notice and prior approval by the California Department of Insurance.

The Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “a+” (Excellent) for the insurance operations of CSAA remain unchanged.
