By Elena Vardon

Prudential PLC is considering listing its Indian investment-management joint venture ICICI.

The insurance-and-investment company said Wednesday that the potential listing would involve divesting some of its shares in the entity, subject to market conditions and relevant approvals. The group intends to return the net proceeds from such a transaction to shareholders, it said.

ICICI Prudential Asset Management is a joint venture formed in 1998 between Indian lender ICICI Bank and Prudential, which does business in Asia and Africa but is listed in London, according to its website.
