How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
--------------------------------------

The **formula for ROE** is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Wuhan P&S Information Technology is:

2.5% = CN¥91m ÷ CN¥3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every CN¥1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CN¥0.02 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?
--------------------------------------------

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

A Side By Side comparison of Wuhan P&S Information Technology's Earnings Growth And 2.5% ROE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is hard to argue that Wuhan P&S Information Technology's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 6.3%, the company's ROE is quite dismal.

For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Wuhan P&S Information Technology's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 4.0% in the same period, which is great to see.
